# Living review of data-extraction algorithms for automating systematic reviews

This git repository contains some code for the app and it contains data (published and 'living' unpublished results in data/screening_snapshot folder). The In-progress files can be used to look up most recent relevant references found between review updates, but for some of these references screening is only partially complete. For published results, please refer to our paper here:
