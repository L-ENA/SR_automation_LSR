"ELNet:Automatic classification and segmentation for esophageal lesions using convolutional neural network","Automatic and accurate esophageal lesion classification and segmentation is of great significance to clinically estimate the lesion statuses of the esophageal diseases and make suitable diagnostic schemes. Due to individual variations and visual similarities of lesions in shapes, colors, and textures, current clinical methods remain subject to potential high-risk and time-consumption issues. In this paper, we propose an Esophageal Lesion Network (ELNet) for automatic esophageal lesion classification and segmentation using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). The underlying method automatically integrates dual-view contextual lesion information to extract global features and local features for esophageal lesion classification and lesion-specific segmentation network is proposed for automatic esophageal lesion annotation at pixel level. For the established clinical large-scale database of 1051 white-light endoscopic images, ten-fold cross-validation is used in method validation. Experiment results show that the proposed framework achieves classification with sensitivity of 0.9034, specificity of 0.9718, and accuracy of 0.9628, and the segmentation with sensitivity of 0.8018, specificity of 0.9655, and accuracy of 0.9462. All of these indicate that our method enables an efficient, accurate, and reliable esophageal lesion diagnosis in clinics.","Wu, Ge, Wen, Liu, Chen, Zhang, He, Hua, Luo, Li","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101838","20201031","Convolutional neural network (CNN); Deep learning; Dual-stream esophageal lesion classification; Esophageal lesions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15940,""
"Efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicinal enemas for treatment of chronic renal failure: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","Chronic renal failure (CRF) is a common kidney disease characterized by a slow and progressive decline in kidney function. Clinical practice suggests that traditional Chinese medicinal enemas have a therapeutic effect on CRF. To assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicinal enemas in treating CRF, we created a protocol for a systematic review to inform future clinical applications. We completed a literature search of all clinical randomized controlled trials evaluating traditional Chinese medicinal enemas on CRF in the following five English and four Chinese databases completed before August 2020: Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Library database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WANFANE Database, Chinese Scientific and Technological Periodical Database (VIP) and Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM). The primary outcomes evaluated blood urea nitrogen levels, uric acid levels, endogenous creatinine clearance rate, and serum creatinine, and the secondary outcomes included clinical efficacy and adverse effects of treatment. Two independent researchers performed data extraction and quality assessment. RevMan5.3 software was used to assess data quality and bias. This protocol was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocol (PRISMA-P) statement. This study will provide a rational synthesis of current evidence for traditional Chinese medicinal enemas for the treatment of CRF. This study presents evidence on whether traditional Chinese medicinal enemas are an effective and safe intervention for CRF patients.

"Text Classification for Clinical Trial Operations: Evaluation and Comparison of Natural Language Processing Techniques","The ability to detect patterns and trends across protocol deviations (PDs) is key to ensure high data quality and sufficient oversight of patient safety. In clinical trial operations, some business processes and work instructions limit efficient protocol deviation trending because a majority of protocol deviations are left unclassified. When this occurs, it restricts clinical teams from determining systemic issues or signals in the data. The unstructured text in protocol deviation descriptions is an important component of trial operation knowledge. Natural language processing (NLP) can make protocol deviation descriptions more accessible and can support information extraction and trending analysis. This paper reviews how the natural language processing techniques of Term-Frequency Inverse-Document-Frequency (TF-IDF) combined with the supervised machine learning model of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and word embedding approaches such as word2vec can be used to categorize/label protocol deviations across multiple therapeutic areas. NLP is a key tool that will lead to more data driven decisions in clinical trial operations.","Richard, Reddy","https://doi.org/10.1007/s43441-020-00236-x","20201030","Clinical trial operations; Natural language processing; Protocol deviations; Term frequency inverse document frequency; Word2vec","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15942,""
"Development of a Model for Predicting Early Discontinuation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Stage III Colon Cancer","To develop a tool that can be used to predict early discontinuation of adjuvant chemotherapy among patients with stage III colon cancer. Through record linkage of Alberta administrative and tumor registry databases, we identified a cohort of individuals age Ã¢â€°Â¥ 18 years who were diagnosed with stage III colon cancer and who received adjuvant chemotherapy in Alberta between 2004 and 2015. Early discontinuation was defined as receipt of &lt; 5 months of a planned 6-month course of chemotherapy. By a systematic review of the literature and a survey of medical oncologists, the following candidate variables were identified: age (years), number of comorbidities (0, 1, Ã¢â€°Â¥ 2), cancer stage (IIIC <i>v</i> IIIA-B), type of chemotherapy (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin; capecitabine and oxaliplatin; or monotherapy), time from surgery to chemotherapy initiation (weeks), type of treatment facility (academic or community), and distance from home to treatment center (kilometers). Models developed using penalized logistic regression and the random forest algorithm were compared. Model performance was assessed using the C-statistic, Brier score, and a calibration plot. Internal validation was performed using the bootstrap method. From an initial 3,115 patients identified, 1,378 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Of these patients, 474 patients (34.4%) failed to complete at least 5 months of chemotherapy. Although well calibrated, the penalized logistic regression model had poor discrimination (optimism-adjusted C-statistic, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.67). In contrast, the random forest model achieved adequate discrimination (optimism-adjusted C-statistic, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.82). Although the degree of calibration of the random forest was acceptable, it was slightly worse than that of the penalized logistic regression model. Internal validation of our random forest model suggests that it may have clinical utility. Additional research regarding its external validation and clinical impact is needed.","Boyne, Brenner, Sajobi, Hilsden, Yusuf, Xu, Friedenreich, Cheung","https://doi.org/10.1200/CCI.20.00065","20201030","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15943,""
"Ascertainment of delirium status using natural language processing from electronic health records","Delirium is underdiagnosed in clinical practice, and is not routinely coded for billing. Manual chart review can be used to identify the occurrence of delirium, however, it is labor-intensive and impractical for large-scale studies. Natural language processing (NLP) has the capability to process raw text in electronic health records (EHRs) and determine the meaning of the information. We developed and validated NLP algorithms to automatically identify the occurrence of delirium from EHRs. This study used a randomly selected cohort from the population-based Mayo Clinic Biobank (n=300, age&gt;=65). We adopted the standardized evidence-based framework confusion assessment method (CAM) to develop and evaluate NLP algorithms to identify the occurrence of delirium using clinical notes in EHRs. Two NLP algorithms were developed based on CAM criteria; one based on the original CAM (NLP-CAM; delirium vs. no delirium) and another based on our modified CAM (NLP-mCAM; definite, possible, and no delirium). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were used for concordance in delirium status between NLP algorithms and manual chart review as the gold standard. The prevalence of delirium cases was examined using ICD-9, NLP-CAM, and NLP-mCAM. NLP-CAM demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.919, 1.000 and 0.967, respectively. NLP-mCAM demonstrated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.827, 0.913 and 0.827, respectively. The prevalence analysis of delirium showed that the NLP-CAM algorithm identified 12,651 (9.4%) delirium patients, the NLP-mCAM algorithm identified 20,611 (15.3%) definite delirium cases and 10,762 (8.0%) possible cases.","Fu, Lopes, Pagali, Thorsteinsdottir, LeBrasseur, Wen, Liu, Rocca, Olson, St Sauver, Sohn","https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaa275","20201030","confusion assessment method; delirium; electronic health records; natural language processing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15944,""
"Differentiating Hepatic Epithelioid Angiomyolipoma From Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Focal Nodular Hyperplasia via Radiomics Models","<b>Background:</b> We conduct a study in developing and validating two radiomics-based models to preoperatively distinguish hepatic epithelioid angiomyolipoma (HEAML) from hepatic carcinoma (HCC) as well as focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). <b>Methods:</b> Totally, preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) data of 170 patients and preoperative contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 137 patients were enrolled in this study. Quantitative texture features and wavelet features were extracted from the regions of interest (ROIs) of each patient imaging data. Then two radiomics signatures were constructed based on CT and MRI radiomics features, respectively, using the random forest (RF) algorithm. By integrating radiomics signatures with clinical characteristics, two radiomics-based fusion models were established through multivariate linear regression and 10-fold cross-validation. Finally, two diagnostic nomograms were built to facilitate the clinical application of the fusion models. <b>Results:</b> The radiomics signatures based on the RF algorithm achieved the optimal predictive performance in both CT and MRI data. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) reached 0.996, 0.879, 0.999, and 0.925 for the training as well as test cohort from CT and MRI data, respectively. Then, two fusion models simultaneously integrated clinical characteristics achieved average AUCs of 0.966 (CT data) and 0.971 (MRI data) with 10-fold cross-validation. Through decision curve analysis, the fusion models were proved to be excellent models to distinguish HEAML from HCC and FNH in comparison between the clinical models and radiomics signatures. <b>Conclusions:</b> Two radiomics-based models derived from CT and MRI images, respectively, performed well in distinguishing HEAML from HCC and FNH and might be potential diagnostic tools to formulate individualized treatment strategies.","Liang, Shao, Liu, Ruan, Tian, Zhang, Wan, Huang, Ding, Xiao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.564307","20201031","focal nodular hyperplasia; hepatic epithelioid angiomyolipoma; hepatocellular carcinoma; machine learning; radiomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15945,""
"A Systematic Review of Machine Learning Techniques in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)","Machine learning techniques are widely used nowadays in the healthcare domain for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of diseases. These techniques have applications in the field of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), which is a potentially curative therapy for hematological malignancies. Herein, a systematic review of the application of machine learning (ML) techniques in the HCT setting was conducted. We examined the type of data streams included, specific ML techniques used, and type of clinical outcomes measured. A systematic review of English articles using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore databases was performed. Search terms included &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT),&quot; &quot;autologous HCT,&quot; &quot;allogeneic HCT,&quot; &quot;machine learning,&quot; and &quot;artificial intelligence.&quot; Only full-text studies reported between January 2015 and July 2020 were included. Data were extracted by two authors using predefined data fields. Following PRISMA guidelines, a total of 242 studies were identified, of which 27 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies were sub-categorized into three broad topics and the type of ML techniques used included ensemble learning (63%), regression (44%), Bayesian learning (30%), and support vector machine (30%). The majority of studies examined models to predict HCT outcomes (e.g., survival, relapse, graft-versus-host disease). Clinical and genetic data were the most commonly used predictors in the modeling process. Overall, this review provided a systematic review of ML techniques applied in the context of HCT. The evidence is not sufficiently robust to determine the optimal ML technique to use in the HCT setting and/or what minimal data variables are required.","Gupta, Braun, Chowdhury, Tewari, Choi","https://doi.org/10.3390/s20216100","20201030","HSCT; artificial intelligence; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; mHealth; machine learning; mobile health; sensors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15946,""
"Clinical concept extraction using transformers","The goal of this study is to explore transformer-based models (eg, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT]) for clinical concept extraction and develop an open-source package with pretrained clinical models to facilitate concept extraction and other downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks in the medical domain. We systematically explored 4 widely used transformer-based architectures, including BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, and ELECTRA, for extracting various types of clinical concepts using 3 public datasets from the 2010 and 2012 i2b2 challenges and the 2018 n2c2 challenge. We examined general transformer models pretrained using general English corpora as well as clinical transformer models pretrained using a clinical corpus and compared them with a long short-term memory conditional random fields (LSTM-CRFs) mode as a baseline. Furthermore, we integrated the 4 clinical transformer-based models into an open-source package. The RoBERTa-MIMIC model achieved state-of-the-art performance on 3 public clinical concept extraction datasets with F1-scores of 0.8994, 0.8053, and 0.8907, respectively. Compared to the baseline LSTM-CRFs model, RoBERTa-MIMIC remarkably improved the F1-score by approximately 4% and 6% on the 2010 and 2012 i2b2 datasets. This study demonstrated the efficiency of transformer-based models for clinical concept extraction. Our methods and systems can be applied to other clinical tasks. The clinical transformer package with 4 pretrained clinical models is publicly available at https://github.com/uf-hobi-informatics-lab/ClinicalTransformerNER. We believe this package will improve current practice on clinical concept extraction and other tasks in the medical domain.","Yang, Bian, Hogan, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa189","20201029","deep learning; named entity recognition; natural language processing; transformer models","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15947,""

A text processing system searched clinical notes from the electronic health record (EHR) for relevant keywords and alerted study personnel via email of potential patients for chart review or in-person evaluation. Between 2016 and 2018, the automated recruitment system resulted in capture of 138 true cases of drug-induced rare events, improving recall from 43% to 93%.

"The effectiveness of e-interventions on fall, neuromuscular functions and quality of life in community-dwelling older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Falls in older adults result in serious, life-limiting consequences. An increasing number of fall prevention interventions have used technology to reduce the number of falls in community-dwelling adults. Various types of e-interventions are being tested in clinical trials and in the community. These include telehealth, exergames, cognitive games, socialized training, smart home systems and non-conventional balance training. Currently, no systematic review and meta-analysis has assessed the overall effectiveness of e-interventions and compared the effectiveness of the different types. The aim of this review was to synthesize best available evidence concerning the effectiveness of e-interventions on fall, neuromuscular functions and quality of life in community-dwelling older adults. A rigorous three-step search was conducted in nine online databases for published and unpublished randomized controlled trials studying e-interventions. Studies were screened and assessed for individual and overall risk of bias by two independent reviewers. Six fall-related outcomes were evaluated in the meta-analysis: fall risk, balance, lower extremity strength, fall efficacy, cognitive function and health-related quality of life. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were conducted during meta-analysis. Thirty-one studies fit the eligibility criteria and had an overall 74.7% low risk of bias. A total of 4,877 older adults from 17 countries were included in narrative synthesis and meta-analysis. Telehealth combined with exercise programmes and smart home systems were able to reduce fall risk significantly (risk ratio=0.79, 95% CI [0.72, 0.86]). E-interventions also significantly improved balance and fall efficacy (standardized mean difference=0.28, 95% CI [0.04, 0.53]). However, lower extremity strength, cognitive function and health-related quality of life did not show significant improvements. Telehealth combined with exercise and smart home systems demonstrated the best evidence of effectiveness in reduction of falls in community-dwelling older adults. Future research should focus on forecasting falls using smart home technology and Artificial Intelligence, and testing promising e-interventions on larger samples to improve the strength of evidence of fall prevention by e-interventions.","Chan, Klainin-Yobas, Chi, Gan, Chow, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103784","20201102","Cognition; Cognitive training; Community-dwelling; Exergames; Fall; Non-conventional balance training; Older adults; Quality of life; Smart home systems; Socialized exercise; Technology; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15949,""
"The Role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in Guiding Precision Medicine for Invasive Bladder Carcinoma","Bladder cancer (BC) is the 10th most common cancer worldwide. Approximately one quarter of patients with BC have muscle-invasive disease (MIBC). Muscle-invasive disease carries a poor prognosis and choosing the optimal treatment option is critical to improve patients' outcomes. Ongoing research supports the role of 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) in guiding patient-specific management decisions throughout the course of MIBC. As an imaging modality, 18F-FDG PET is acquired simultaneously with either computed tomography (CT) or MRI to offer a hybrid approach combining anatomical and metabolic information that complement each other. At initial staging, 18F-FDG PET/CT enhances the detection of extravesical disease, particularly in patients classified as oligometastatic by conventional imaging. 18F-FDG PET/CT has value in monitoring response to neoadjuvant and systemic chemotherapy, as well as in localizing relapse after treatment. In the new era of immunotherapy, 18F-FDG PET/CT may also be useful to monitor treatment efficacy as well as to detect immune-related adverse events. With the advent of artificial intelligence techniques such as radiomics and deep learning, these hybrid medical images can be mined for quantitative data, providing incremental value over current standard-of-care clinical and biological data. This approach has the potential to produce a major paradigm shift toward data-driven precision medicine with the ultimate goal of personalized medicine. In this review, we highlight current literature reporting the role of 18F-FDG PET in supporting personalized management decisions for patients with MIBC. Specific topics reviewed include the incremental value of 18F-FDG PET in prognostication, pre-operative planning, response assessment, prediction of recurrence, and diagnosing drug toxicity.","Girard, Vila Reyes, Shaish, Grellier, Dercle, SalaÃƒÂ¼n, Delcroix, Rouanne","https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.565086","20201030","PET Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Positron Emission Tomography; bladder cancer; immunotherapy; muscle invasive bladder cancer; staging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15950,""
"Artificial Intelligence Algorithms to Diagnose Glaucoma and Detect Glaucoma Progression: Translation to Clinical Practice","This concise review aims to explore the potential for the clinical implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies for detecting glaucoma and monitoring glaucoma progression. Nonsystematic literature review using the search combinations &quot;Artificial Intelligence,&quot; &quot;Deep Learning,&quot; &quot;Machine Learning,&quot; &quot;Neural Networks,&quot; &quot;Bayesian Networks,&quot; &quot;Glaucoma Diagnosis,&quot; and &quot;Glaucoma Progression.&quot; Information on sensitivity and specificity regarding glaucoma diagnosis and progression analysis as well as methodological details were extracted. Numerous AI strategies provide promising levels of specificity and sensitivity for structural (e.g. optical coherence tomography [OCT] imaging, fundus photography) and functional (visual field [VF] testing) test modalities used for the detection of glaucoma. Area under receiver operating curve (AROC) values of &gt; 0.90 were achieved with every modality. Combining structural and functional inputs has been shown to even more improve the diagnostic ability. Regarding glaucoma progression, AI strategies can detect progression earlier than conventional methods or potentially from one single VF test. AI algorithms applied to fundus photographs for screening purposes may provide good results using a simple and widely accessible test. However, for patients who are likely to have glaucoma more sophisticated methods should be used including data from OCT and perimetry. Outputs may serve as an adjunct to assist clinical decision making, whereas also enhancing the efficiency, productivity, and quality of the delivery of glaucoma care. Patients with diagnosed glaucoma may benefit from future algorithms to evaluate their risk of progression. Challenges are yet to be overcome, including the external validity of AI strategies, a move from a &quot;black box&quot; toward &quot;explainable AI,&quot; and likely regulatory hurdles. However, it is clear that AI can enhance the role of specialist clinicians and will inevitably shape the future of the delivery of glaucoma care to the next generation. The promising levels of diagnostic accuracy reported by AI strategies across the modalities used in clinical practice for glaucoma detection can pave the way for the development of reliable models appropriate for their translation into clinical practice. Future incorporation of AI into healthcare models may help address the current limitations of access and timely management of patients with glaucoma across the world.","Mursch-Edlmayr, Ng, Diniz-Filho, Sousa, Arnold, Schlenker, Duenas-Angeles, Keane, Crowston, Jayaram","https://doi.org/10.1167/tvst.9.2.55","20201030","artificial intelligence; glaucoma; machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15951,""
"Motor neuroprosthesis implanted with neurointerventional surgery improves capacity for activities of daily living tasks in severe paralysis: first in-human experience","Implantable brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), functioning as motor neuroprostheses, have the potential to restore voluntary motor impulses to control digital devices and improve functional independence in patients with severe paralysis due to brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve or muscle dysfunction. However, reports to date have had limited clinical translation. Two participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) underwent implant in a single-arm, open-label, prospective, early feasibility study. Using a minimally invasive neurointervention procedure, a novel endovascular Stentrode BCI was implanted in the superior sagittal sinus adjacent to primary motor cortex. The participants undertook machine-learning-assisted training to use wirelessly transmitted electrocorticography signal associated with attempted movements to control multiple mouse-click actions, including zoom and left-click. Used in combination with an eye-tracker for cursor navigation, participants achieved Windows 10 operating system control to conduct instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) tasks. Unsupervised home use commenced from day 86 onwards for participant 1, and day 71 for participant 2. Participant 1 achieved a typing task average click selection accuracy of 92.63% (100.00%, 87.50%-100.00%) (trial mean (median, Q1-Q3)) at a rate of 13.81 (13.44, 10.96-16.09) correct characters per minute (CCPM) with predictive text disabled.

"Physical activity interventions for people with congenital heart disease","Congenital heart disease (ConHD) affectsÃ‚Â approximately 1% of all live births. People with ConHD are living longer due to improved medical intervention and are at risk of developing non-communicable diseases. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is reduced in people with ConHD, who deteriorateÃ‚Â faster compared to healthy people. CRF is known to be prognostic of future mortality and morbidity: itÃ‚Â isÃ‚Â thereforeÃ‚Â important to assess the evidence base on physical activity interventions in this population to inform decision making. To assess the effectiveness and safety of all types of physical activity interventions versusÃ‚Â standard careÃ‚Â in individuals with congenital heart disease. We undertook aÃ‚Â systematicÃ‚Â search onÃ‚Â 23Ã‚Â September 2019 of the following databases: CENTRAL,Ã‚Â MEDLINE, Embase,Ã‚Â CINAHL, AMED, BIOSIS Citation Index,Ã‚Â Web of Science Core Collection, LILACS andÃ‚Â DARE. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and weÃ‚Â reviewed the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews. We includedÃ‚Â randomised controlled trialsÃ‚Â (RCT) that compared any type of physical activity intervention against a 'no physical activity' (usual care) control. We included all individualsÃ‚Â with a diagnosis ofÃ‚Â congenital heart disease, regardless of age or previous medical interventions.Ã‚ DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (CAW and CW)Ã‚Â independently screened all the identified references for inclusion. We retrieved and read all full papers; and we contacted study authors if we needed any further information. The same two independent reviewers whoÃ‚Â extracted the data thenÃ‚Â processed the included papers, assessed their risk of bias using RoB 2Ã‚Â and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.Ã‚Â The primary outcomes were: maximal cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) assessed byÃ‚Â peak oxygen consumption; health-related quality of life (HRQoL) determined by a validated questionnaire; and device-worn 'objective' measures of physical activity. We included 15Ã‚Â RCTsÃ‚Â with 924Ã‚Â participantsÃ‚Â in the review. The median intervention length/follow-up length was 12 weeks (12 to 26 interquartile range (IQR)).Ã‚Â There were five RCTs of children and adolescents (n = 500) and 10 adult RCTs (n = 424). We identified three types of intervention: physical activity promotion; exercise training; and inspiratory muscle training. We assessed the risk of bias of results for CRF as either being of some concern (n = 12) or atÃ‚Â a high risk of bias (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2), due to aÃ‚Â failure to blindÃ‚Â intervention staff. One study did not report this outcome. Using the GRADE method, we assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate to very low across measured outcomes. When we pooled all types of interventions (physical activity promotion, exercise training and inspiratory muscle training), compared to a 'noÃ‚Â exercise' controlÃ‚Â CRF may slightly increase, with aÃ‚Â mean difference (MD) of 1.89 mL/kg<sup>-1</sup>/min<sup>-1</sup> (95% CI -0.22 toÃ‚Â 3.99; n = 732; moderate-certainty evidence).Ã‚Â The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of physical activity and exercise interventions on HRQoL. There was a standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.76Ã‚Â (95% CI -0.13 to 1.65;Ã‚Â n = 163; very low certainty evidence) in HRQoL. However, we could pool only threeÃ‚Â studies in a meta-analysis, due to different ways of reporting. Only one study out of eight showed a positive effect on HRQoL. There may be a small improvement in mean daily physical activity (PA) (SMD 0.38,Ã‚Â 95% CI -0.15 toÃ‚Â 0.92; n = 328; low-certainty evidence), which equates toÃ‚Â approximately an additional 10 minutes of physical activity daily (95% CI -2.50 toÃ‚Â 22.20). Physical activity and exercise interventions likely result in an increase in submaximal cardiorespiratory fitness (MD 2.05,Ã‚Â 95% CI 0.05 to 4.05; n = 179; moderate-certainty evidence). Physical activity and exercise interventions likely increase muscular strength (MD 17.13, 95% CI 3.45 to 30.81; n = 18; moderate-certainty evidence).Ã‚Â Eleven studies (n = 501) reported on the outcome of adverse events (73% of total studies). Of the 11 studies, sixÃ‚Â studies reported zeroÃ‚Â adverse events. FiveÃ‚Â studies reported a total of 11 adverse events; 36% of adverse events were cardiac relatedÃ‚Â (nÃ‚Â = 4); there were, however, no serious adverse eventsÃ‚Â related to the interventions or reportedÃ‚Â fatalities (moderate-certainty evidence).Ã‚Â No studies reported hospital admissions. This review summarises the latest evidence on CRF, HRQoL and PA. Although there were only small improvements in CRF and PA, and small to noÃ‚Â improvements in HRQoL, there were no reported seriousÃ‚Â adverse events related to the interventions. Although these data are promising, there is currentlyÃ‚Â insufficient evidence to definitively determine the impact of physical activityÃ‚Â interventions in ConHD. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials are therefore needed, utilisingÃ‚Â a longer duration of follow-up.","Williams, Wadey, Pieles, Stuart, Taylor, Long","https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013400.pub2","20201029","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15953,""
"Neutrophil activity in sepsis: a systematic review","The neutrophil is an important cell in host defense against infections, acting as the first line of microorganism control. However, this cell exhibits dysregulated activity in sepsis and may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. This systematic review aimed to highlight the major scientific findings regarding neutrophil activity in sepsis reported in clinical and experimental research published in the last 10 years. The search was conducted in the Virtual Health Library of PAHO-WHO (BVS) and PubMed databases, and articles published between January 2007 and May 2017 in Portuguese, English, and Spanish were eligible. Article selection was carried out independently by two reviewers (CB and IB). A total of 233 articles were found, of which 87 were identified on PubMed and 146 on BVS. Eighty-two articles were duplicates. Of the remaining 151 articles, 19 met the inclusion criteria after title, abstract, and full-text analysis. Overall, research in clinical samples and animal models of sepsis showed reduced capacity of neutrophils to migrate and delayed apoptosis, but there was no consensus on the phagocytic activity of neutrophils in sepsis. Molecules, such as pentraxin 3 (PTX3), have been analyzed as potential diagnostic markers in sepsis but the diversity of soluble molecules detected in blood samples of sepsis patients did not enable further understanding of the correlation of these circulating molecules with neutrophil activity during sepsis. Optimal understanding of the function of neutrophils in sepsis remains a challenge that, if overcome, would eventually allow targeted therapeutic interventions in patients affected by this severe syndrome.","Resende, Borges, GonÃƒÂ§alves, Carneiro, Rezende, Pinho, Nobre, Teixeira","https://doi.org/10.1590/1414-431X20207851","20201028","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15954,""
"The Impact of Obesity on COVID-19 Disease Severity","Obesity has been declared a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. In this rapid review, we provide an overview of recently-published papers with clinical and epidemiological relevance on this topic. As part of a weekly COVID-19 data mining meeting, we conducted a literature review regarding the role of obesity in COVID-19 outcomes, particularly in young patients with COVID-19. We utilized the PubMed, Upstate Medical University Health Sciences Library, Google Scholar, and LitCovid databases to identify the articles. Our group identified seven relevant publications (four retrospective case series and three reviews). Our group's review of this topic illustrates that obesity is a common comorbidity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Obesity is associated with an increased likelihood of intermittent mandatory ventilation within the first 10 days of hospitalization and a higher risk of admission to acute or critical hospital care, including in patients aged less than 60 years, with one study showing it to be a greater risk factor than cardiovascular or pulmonary conditions for critical COVID-19 illness. There are some indications that moderate-intensity exercise may be beneficial for promoting a healthy immune system in patients with and without obesity. Given these findings, hospitals should ensure their staff are prepared and their facilities are adequately equipped to provide high-quality care to patients with obesity (PWO) hospitalized with COVID-19. Family medicine and primary care physicians are encouraged to counsel their PWO about their increased risk for morbidity and mortality during this pandemic.","Long, Ward, Khorasani-Zadeh","https://doi.org/10.22454/PRiMER.2020.104798","20201029","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15955,""
"A comprehensive survey of AI-enabled phishing attacks detection techniques","In recent times, a phishing attack has become one of the most prominent attacks faced by internet users, governments, and service-providing organizations. In a phishing attack, the attacker(s) collects the client's sensitive data (i.e., user account login details, credit/debit card numbers, etc.) by using spoofed emails or fake websites. Phishing websites are common entry points of online social engineering attacks, including numerous frauds on the websites. In such types of attacks, the attacker(s) create website pages by copying the behavior of legitimate websites and sends URL(s) to the targeted victims through spam messages, texts, or social networking. To provide a thorough understanding of phishing attack(s), this paper provides a literature review of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Hybrid Learning, and Scenario-based techniques for phishing attack detection. This paper also presents the comparison of different studies detecting the phishing attack for each AI technique and examines the qualities and shortcomings of these methodologies. Furthermore, this paper provides a comprehensive set of current challenges of phishing attacks and future research direction in this domain.","Basit, Zafar, Liu, Javed, Jalil, Kifayat","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11235-020-00733-2","20201028","Advanced phishing techniques; Cyberattack; Deep learning; Hybrid learning; Internet security; Machine learning; Phishing attack; Security threats","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15956,""
"Predicting population health with machine learning: a scoping review","To determine how machine learning has been applied to prediction applications in population health contexts. Specifically, to describe which outcomes have been studied, the data sources most widely used and whether reporting of machine learning predictive models aligns with established reporting guidelines. A scoping review. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, INSPEC and ACM Digital Library were searched on 18 July 2018. We included English articles published between 1980 and 2018 that used machine learning to predict population-health-related outcomes. We excluded studies that only used logistic regression or were restricted to a clinical context. We summarised findings extracted from published reports, which included general study characteristics, aspects of model development, reporting of results and model discussion items. Of 22 618 articles found by our search, 231 were included in the review. The USA (n=71, 30.74%) and China (n=40, 17.32%) produced the most studies. Cardiovascular disease (n=22, 9.52%) was the most studied outcome. The median number of observations was 5414 (IQR=16Ã¢â‚¬â€°543.5) and the median number of features was 17 (IQR=31). Health records (n=126, 54.5%) and investigator-generated data (n=86, 37.2%) were the most common data sources. Many studies did not incorporate recommended guidelines on machine learning and predictive modelling. Predictive discrimination was commonly assessed using area under the receiver operator curve (n=98, 42.42%) and calibration was rarely assessed (n=22, 9.52%). Machine learning applications in population health have concentrated on regions and diseases well represented in traditional data sources, infrequently using big data. Important aspects of model development were under-reported. Greater use of big data and reporting guidelines for predictive modelling could improve machine learning applications in population health.

"Contrast-Enhanced CT-based Textural Parameters as Potential Prognostic Factors of Survival for Colorectal Cancer Patients Receiving Targeted Therapy","This study was designed to estimate the clinical significance of the contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) textural features for prediction of survival in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients receiving targeted therapy (bevacizumab and cetuximab). The LifeX software was used to extract the textural parameters of the tumor lesions in the contrast-enhanced CT. We used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression and random forest method to screen the non-redundant radiomic features and constructed the CT imaging score. Univariate and multivariate analyses through the Cox proportional hazards model were performed to assess the prognostic clinical factor. Based on the result of multivariate analysis and CT imaging score, combined nomogram model was constructed to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients. Decision curves analysis was employed to evaluate the performance of the combined model and clinical model. After comparative analysis of the area under curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, we chose the result of random forest model as CT imaging score. Considering the clinical practice and the result of analysis, age, surgery, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level have been introduced into clinical model. Based on the result of analysis and the CT imaging score, we constructed the nomogram combined model. C-index and calibration curve verified the goodness of fit and discrimination of the combined model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) demonstrated that the combined model showed the better net benefit for a 3-year OS than clinical model. In conclusion, the study provides preliminary evidences that several radiomic parameters of tumor lesions derived from CT images were prognostic factors and predictive markers for CRC patients who are candidates for targeted therapy (bevacizumab and cetuximab).","Zhao, Yang, Luo, Yang, Guo, Zhang, Hao, Yao, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11307-020-01552-2","20201027","Colorectal neoplasms; Molecular targeted therapy; Multidetector computed tomography; Prognosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15958,""
"Literature mining for context-specific molecular relations using multimodal representations (COMMODAR)","Biological contextual information helps understand various phenomena occurring in the biological systems consisting of complex molecular relations. The construction of context-specific relational resources vastly relies on laborious manual extraction from unstructured literature. In this paper, we propose COMMODAR, a machine learning-based literature mining framework for context-specific molecular relations using multimodal representations. The main idea of COMMODAR is the feature augmentation by the cooperation of multimodal representations for relation extraction. We leveraged biomedical domain knowledge as well as canonical linguistic information for more comprehensive representations of textual sources. The models based on multiple modalities outperformed those solely based on the linguistic modality. We applied COMMODAR to the 14 million PubMed abstracts and extracted 9214 context-specific molecular relations.

"Identifying Ethical Considerations for Machine Learning Healthcare Applications","Along with potential benefits to healthcare delivery, machine learning healthcare applications (ML-HCAs) raise a number of ethical concerns. Ethical evaluations of ML-HCAs will need to structure the overall problem of evaluating these technologies, especially for a diverse group of stakeholders. This paper outlines a systematic approach to identifying ML-HCA ethical concerns, starting with a conceptual model of the pipeline of the conception, development, implementation of ML-HCAs, and the parallel pipeline of evaluation and oversight tasks at each stage. Over this model, we layer key questions that raise value-based issues, along with ethical considerations identified in large part by a literature review, but also identifying some ethical considerations that have yet to receive attention. This pipeline model framework will be useful for systematic ethical appraisals of ML-HCA from development through implementation, and for interdisciplinary collaboration of diverse stakeholders that will be required to understand and subsequently manage the ethical implications of ML-HCAs.","Char, AbrÃƒÂ moff, Feudtner","https://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2020.1819469","20201029","Artificial intelligence; effectiveness; ethics; machine learning; safety; test characteristics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15960,""
"Room for interpersonal relationships in online educational spaces - a philosophical discussion","<b>Purpose:</b> To explore interpersonal relationships within online educational spaces and to connect the discussion to health and well-being among students and teachers. <b>Method:</b> We apply different perspectives to analyse the complexity of interpersonal relationships in online educational spaces, based on the philosophies of Nel Nodding, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Alfred Schutz. We use aÃ‚Â qualitative methodological combination-philosophical explorations, literature review, and text analysis-to offer significant insights that will substantially inform contemporary theories in research addressing interpersonal relationships in online education. <b>Results:</b> We illuminate and theorize about interpersonal relationships in terms of being cared for, confirmed by, and connected to others as dimensions of significance for health and well-being in educational spaces in the form of flexible online courses at the university level. <b>Conclusion:</b> We argue that all education should strive to provide caring relationships and educate for both self-understanding and group understanding, and contribute to school as a place where happiness and joy for genuine learning and knowledge are promoted. To achieve this, it is of significance to also be connected to and confirmed by others, teachers as well as students, and also to exist in a (class)room that provides room for interpersonal relationships: in real life or online.","Kostenius, Alerby","https://doi.org/10.1080/17482631.2019.1689603","20201026","Health; Interpersonal relationships; Online education; Paradigm case; Philosophical; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15961,""
"A Comparison of the Development of Medical Informatics in China and That in Western Countries from 2008 to 2018: A Bibliometric Analysis of Official Journal Publications","We focused on medical informatics journal publications rather than on conference proceedings by comparing and analyzing the data from journals and conferences from a broader perspective. The aim is to summarize the unique contributions of China to medical digitization and foster more multilevel international cooperation. In February 2019, publications from 2008 to 2018 in three major English-language medical informatics journals were retrieved through Scopus, including the journals, namely, International Journal of Medical Informatics (IJMI, international community), JAMIA (United States), and Methods of Information in Medicine (MIM, Europe). Three major Chinese-language journals, namely, China Digital Medicine (CDM), Chinese Journal of Health Informatics and Management (CJHIM), and Chinese Journal of Medical Library and Information Science (CJMLIS), were searched within the major three Chinese literature databases. The datasets were preprocessed using the NLP package on Python, and a smart local moving algorithm was used as a clustering method for identifying the aforementioned journals. Between 2008 and 2018, the total number of published papers and H-index of the three English-language journals was 1371 and 67 (IJMI), 1752 and 86 (JAMIA), and 637 and 35 (MIM), respectively. In the same period, the total number of published papers and H-index in the three Chinese-language journals was 6668 and 23 (CDM), 1668 and 22 (CJHIM), and 2557 and 25 (CJMLIS), respectively. IJMI, JAMIA, and MIM received submissions from 82, 59, and 62 countries/regions, respectively. By contrast, the three Chinese journals only received submissions from seven foreign countries. The proportions of authors from institutional affiliations were similar between the three English-language journals (IJMI, JAMIA, and MIM) and CJMLIS because the majority of the authors were from universities (81%, 74%, 73%, and 65.2%), followed by medical institutions (12%, 10%, 9%, and 23.4%) or research institutes (2%, 4%, 10%, and 4.3%). Furthermore, the proportions of the authors from enterprises were low (2%, 6%, 4%, and 0.3%) for all journals. However, the authors in CDM and CJHIM were mainly from medical institutions (50% and 40%), followed by universities (33% and 32%) and research institutes (3% and 4%). In addition, the proportions of enterprises were only 3% and 2%, respectively. Among the top five authors in three English-language journals (ranked in terms of the number of published papers), 100% had doctoral or master's degrees, compared with only 60% in the Chinese journals. Additionally, 28204 different keywords were extracted from the aforementioned papers, covering 275 specific high-frequency key terms. Based on these key terms, four clusters were found in the English literature-&quot;Health and Clinical Information Systems,&quot; &quot;Internet and Telemedicine,&quot; &quot;Medical Data Statistical Analysis,&quot; and &quot;EHRs and Information Management&quot;-and three clusters were found in the Chinese literature: &quot;Hospital Information Systems and EMR,&quot; &quot;Library Science and Bibliometrics Analysis,&quot; and &quot;Medical Reform Policy and Health Digitization.&quot; Only two clusters are similar, and Chinese-language journals focus more on health information in technology and industrial applications than in medical informatics basic research. This study provides important insights into the development of medical informatics (MI) in China and Western countries showing that the medical informatics journals of China, the United States, and Europe have distinct characteristics. Specifically, first, compared with the Western journals, the number of papers published in the journals of professional associations in the field of MI in China is large and the application value is high, but the academic influence and academic value are relatively low; second, most of the authors of the Chinese papers are from hospitals, and most of the counterparts in the Western countries are from universities. The proportion of master's or doctoral degrees in the former is also lower than that of the latter; furthermore, regarding paper themes, on the one hand, China MI has no theoretical and basic research on medical data statistics and consumer health based on the Internet and telemedicine; on the other hand, after nearly 10 years of hospital digital development, China has fully used the latecomer and application advantages in hospitals and, through extensive international cooperation, has made significant advancements in and contributions to the development of medical information.","Liang, Zhang, Fan, Shen, Chen, Xu, Ge, Xin, Lei","https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8822311","20201028","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15962,""
"A systematic review and meta-analysis of memory-guided attention: Frontal and parietal activation suggests involvement of fronto-parietal networks","Prior knowledge and long-term memory can guide our attention to facilitate search for and detection of subtle targets embedded in a complex scene. A number of neuropsychological and experimental studies have investigated this effect, yet results in the field remain mixed, as there is a lack of consensus regarding the neural correlates thought to support memory-guided attention. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify a common set of brain structures involved in memory-guided attention. Statistical analyses were computed on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that presented participants with a task that required them to detect a target or a change embedded in repeated and novel complex visual displays. After a systematic search, 10 fMRI studies met the selection criteria and were included in the analysis. The results yielded four significant clusters. Activity in right inferior parietal (Brodmann area [BA] 9) and right superior parietal (BA 7) lobes suggests involvement of a fronto-parietal attention network, while activity in left mid-cingulate cortex (BA 23) and right middle frontal gyrus (BA 10) suggests involvement of a fronto-parietal control network. These findings are consistent with the notion that fronto-parietal circuits are important for interfacing retrieved memories with attentional systems to guide search.

"Psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions for methamphetamine addiction: protocol for a scoping review of the literature","Methamphetamine use and harms are rising rapidly. Management of patients with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) and problematic methamphetamine use (PMU) is challenging, with no clearly established best approach; both psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions have been described. Furthermore, given the diversity of individuals that use methamphetamines, there is a need to assess evidence for treatments for subgroups including youths; gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men; individuals with mental health comorbidities; and individuals in correction services. Establishing awareness of the messages regarding treatment from recent clinical practice guidelines (CPG) in the field is also of value. The first study objective will be to establish a greater understanding of the methods, populations, and findings of controlled studies for psychosocial and pharmacologic treatments for MUD and PMU. Investigation of this information can help establish the potential for advanced syntheses of the evidence (such as network meta-analysis) to compare therapies for this condition and to identify gaps related to key populations where more primary research is needed. Summarizing the recommendations regarding treatment of MUD/PMU from recent CPGs and systematic reviews will be an important secondary objective. A scoping review will be performed. Using the OVID platform, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and relevant Cochrane databases from EBM Reviews will be searched (from databases' inception onwards). Eligibility criteria will include individuals described as having MUD or PMU, with designs of interest including randomized trials, non-randomized trials, and controlled cohort studies with three or more months of follow-up; systematic reviews and CPGs will also be sought. Two reviewers (with support from automation tools) will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and chart data. Different approaches to handling and summarizing the data will be implemented for each type of study design. Tables and graphics will be used to map evidence sources and identify evidence gaps. This research will enhance awareness of evidence addressing the effects of psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions for MUD/PMU overall and in sub-populations, both in terms of recent CPGs/reviews and primary studies; inspection of the latter will also help establish the feasibility of future syntheses to compare treatments, such as network meta-analysis.

"Computer-aided diagnosis of liver lesions using CT images: A systematic review","Medical image processing has a strong footprint in radio diagnosis for the detection of diseases from the images. Several computer-aided systems were researched in the recent past to assist the radiologist in diagnosing liver diseases and reducing the interpretation time. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art techniques in computer-assisted diagnosis systems to predict benign and malignant lesions using computed tomography images. The research articles published between 1998 and 2020 obtained from various standard databases were considered for preparing the review. The research papers include both conventional as well as deep learning-based systems for liver lesion diagnosis. The paper initially discusses the various hepatic lesions that are identifiable on computed tomography images, then the computer-aided diagnosis systems and their workflow. The conventional and deep learning-based systems are presented in stages wherein the various methods used for preprocessing, liver and lesion segmentation, radiological feature extraction and classification are discussed. The review suggests the scope for future, work as efficient and effective segmentation methods that work well with diverse images have not been developed. Furthermore, unsupervised and semi-supervised deep learning models were not investigated for liver disease diagnosis in the reviewed papers. Other areas to be explored include image fusion and inclusion of essential clinical features along with the radiological features for better classification accuracy.","Nayantara, Kamath, Manjunath, Rajagopal","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.104035","20201102","Classification; Computer-aided detection/diagnosis; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Hemangioma; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Liver diseases; Liver/lesion segmentation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15965,""
"Automated compounding technology and workflow solutions for the preparation of chemotherapy: a systematic review","The current systematic review (SR) was undertaken to summarise the published literature reporting the clinical and economic value of automation for chemotherapy preparation management to include compounding workflow software and robotic compounding systems. Literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library on 16 November 2017 to identify publications investigating chemotherapy compounding workflow software solutions used in a hospital pharmacy for the preparation of chemotherapy. 5175 publications were screened by title and abstract and 18 of 72 full publications screened were included. Grey literature searching identified an additional seven publications. The SR identified 25 publications relating to commercial technologies for compounding (Robotic compounding systems: APOTECAchemo (n=12), CytoCare (n=5) and RIVA (n=1); Workflow software: Cato (n=6) and Diana (n=1)). The studies demonstrate that compounding technologies improved accuracy in dose preparations and reduced dose errors compared with manual compounding. Comparable levels of contamination were reported for technologies compared with manual compounding. The compounding technologies were associated with reductions in annual costs compared with manual compounding, but the impact on compounding times was not consistent and was dependent on the type of compounding technology. The published evidence suggests that the implementation of chemotherapy compounding automation solutions may reduce compounding errors and reduce costs; however, this is highly variable depending on the form of automation. In addition, the available evidence is heterogeneous, sparse and inconsistently reported. A key finding from the current SR is a 'call to action' to encourage pharmacists to publish data following implementation of chemotherapy compounding technologies in their hospital, which would allow for evidence-based recommendations on the benefits of chemotherapy compounding technologies.","Batson, Mitchell, Lau, Canobbio, de Goede, Singh, Loesch","https://doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2019-001948","20201026","automation; chemotherapy; compounding; hospital pharmacy; robotics; workflow","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15966,""
"A systematic review and meta-analysis of the prognostic value of radiomics based models in non-small cell lung cancer treated with curative radiotherapy","Radiomics allows extraction of quantifiable features from imaging. This study performs a systematic review and meta-analysis of the performance of radiomics based prognostic models in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A literature review was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for articles investigating radiomics features predictive of overall survival (OS) in NSCLC treated with curative intent radiotherapy. A random-effects meta-analysis of Harrell's Concordance Index (C-index) was performed on the performance of radiomics models. Of the 2746 articles retrieved, 40 studies of 55 datasets and 6223 patients were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. There was significant heterogeneity in the methodology for feature selection and model development. Twelve datasets reported the C-index of radiomics based models in predicting OS and were included in the meta-analysis. The C-index random effects estimate was 0.57 (95% CI 0.53 - 0.62). There was significant heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 70.3%). Based on this review, radiomics based models for lung cancer have to date demonstrated modest prognostic capabilities. Future research should consider using standardised radiomics features, robust feature selection and model development, and deep learning techniques, absolving the need for pre-defined features, to improve imaging-based models.","Kothari, Korte, Lehrer, Zaorsky, Lazarakis, Kron, Hardcastle, Siva","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2020.10.023","20201023","Artificial Intelligence; Lung Cancer; Non-small cell lung cancer; Prognostic models; Radiomics; Radiotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15967,""
"Clinical Context-Aware Biomedical Text Summarization Using Deep Neural Network: Model Development and Validation","Automatic text summarization (ATS) enables users to retrieve meaningful evidence from big data of biomedical repositories to make complex clinical decisions. Deep neural and recurrent networks outperform traditional machine-learning techniques in areas of natural language processing and computer vision; however, they are yet to be explored in the ATS domain, particularly for medical text summarization. Traditional approaches in ATS for biomedical text suffer from fundamental issues such as an inability to capture clinical context, quality of evidence, and purpose-driven selection of passages for the summary. We aimed to circumvent these limitations through achieving precise, succinct, and coherent information extraction from credible published biomedical resources, and to construct a simplified summary containing the most informative content that can offer a review particular to clinical needs. In our proposed approach, we introduce a novel framework, termed Biomed-Summarizer, that provides quality-aware Patient/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO)-based intelligent and context-enabled summarization of biomedical text. Biomed-Summarizer integrates the prognosis quality recognition model with a clinical context-aware model to locate text sequences in the body of a biomedical article for use in the final summary. First, we developed a deep neural network binary classifier for quality recognition to acquire scientifically sound studies and filter out others. Second, we developed a bidirectional long-short term memory recurrent neural network as a clinical context-aware classifier, which was trained on semantically enriched features generated using a word-embedding tokenizer for identification of meaningful sentences representing PICO text sequences. Third, we calculated the similarity between query and PICO text sequences using Jaccard similarity with semantic enrichments, where the semantic enrichments are obtained using medical ontologies. Last, we generated a representative summary from the high-scoring PICO sequences aggregated by study type, publication credibility, and freshness score. Evaluation of the prognosis quality recognition model using a large dataset of biomedical literature related to intracranial aneurysm showed an accuracy of 95.41% (2562/2686) in terms of recognizing quality articles. The clinical context-aware multiclass classifier outperformed the traditional machine-learning algorithms, including support vector machine, gradient boosted tree, linear regression, K-nearest neighbor, and naÃƒÂ¯ve Bayes, by achieving 93% (16127/17341) accuracy for classifying five categories: aim, population, intervention, results, and outcome. The semantic similarity algorithm achieved a significant Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.61 (0-1 scale) on a well-known BIOSSES dataset (with 100 pair sentences) after semantic enrichment, representing an improvement of 8.9% over baseline Jaccard similarity. Finally, we found a highly positive correlation among the evaluations performed by three domain experts concerning different metrics, suggesting that the automated summarization is satisfactory. By employing the proposed method Biomed-Summarizer, high accuracy in ATS was achieved, enabling seamless curation of research evidence from the biomedical literature to use for clinical decision-making.","Afzal, Alam, Malik, Malik","https://doi.org/10.2196/19810","20201026","automatic text summarization; biomedical informatics; brain aneurysm; deep neural network; semantic similarity; word embedding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15968,""
"Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network Approach for COVID-19 Disease Detection","In this paper two novel, powerful and robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures are designed and proposed for two different classification tasks using publicly available datasets. The first architecture is able to decide whether a given chest X-ray image of a patient contains COVID-19 or not with 98.92% average accuracy. The second CNN architecture is able to divide a given chest X-ray image of a patient into three classes (COVID-19 vs. Normal vs. Pneumonia) with 98.27% average accuracy. The hyper-parameters of the both CNN models are automatically determined using Grid Search. Experimental results on large clinical datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed architectures and demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can overcome disadvantages mentioned above. Moreover, the proposed CNN models are fully-automatic in terms of not requiring the extraction of diseased tissue; which is a great improvement of available automatic methods in the literature. To the best of author's knowledge, this study is the first study to detect COVID-19 disease from given chest X-ray images, using CNN whose hyper parameters are automatically determined by the Grid Search. Another important contribution of this study is that it is the first CNN based COVID-19 chest X-ray image classification study which uses the largest possible clinical dataset. A total of 1524 COVID-19, 1527 pneumonia and 1524 normal X-ray images are collected. It is aimed to collect the largest number of COVID-19 X-ray images that exist in the literature until the writing of this research paper.","Irmak","https://doi.org/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00084.2020","20201023","COVID-19 detection; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Image classification; Medical Image","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15969,""
"Endoscopic imaging in inflammatory bowel disease: current developments and emerging strategies","Developments in enhanced and magnified endoscopy have signified major advances in endoscopic imaging of ileocolonic pathology in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to augment the benefits of these advanced techniques. Nevertheless, treatment of IBD patients is frustrated by high rates of non-response to therapy, while delayed detection and failures to detect neoplastic lesions impede successful surveillance. A possible solution is offered by molecular imaging, which adds functional imaging data to mucosal morphology assessment through visualizing biological parameters. Other label-free modalities enable visualization beyond the mucosal surface without the need of tracers. A literature search up to May 2020 was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE in order to find relevant articles that involve the (pre-)clinical application of high-definition white light endoscopy, chromoendoscopy, artificial intelligence, confocal laser endomicroscopy, endocytoscopy, molecular imaging, optical coherence tomography, and Raman spectroscopy in IBD. Enhanced and magnified endoscopy have enabled an improved assessment of the ileocolonic mucosa. Implementing molecular imaging in endoscopy could overcome the remaining clinical challenges by giving practitioners a real-time in vivo view of targeted biomarkers. Label-free modalities could help optimize the endoscopic assessment of mucosal healing and dysplasia detection in IBD patients.","van der Laan, van der Waaij, GabriÃƒÂ«ls, Festen, Dijkstra, Nagengast","https://doi.org/10.1080/17474124.2021.1840352","20201102","Artificial intelligence; chromoendoscopy; confocal laser endomicroscopy; endocytoscopy; endoscopy; inflammatory bowel disease; molecular imaging; optical coherence tomography; raman spectroscopy; surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15970,""
"Artificial intelligence for brain diseases: A systematic review","Artificial intelligence (AI) is a major branch of computer science that is fruitfully used for analyzing complex medical data and extracting meaningful relationships in datasets, for several clinical aims. Specifically, in the brain care domain, several innovative approaches have achieved remarkable results and open new perspectives in terms of diagnosis, planning, and outcome prediction. In this work, we present an overview of different artificial intelligent techniques used in the brain care domain, along with a review of important clinical applications. A systematic and careful literature search in major databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science was carried out using &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; and &quot;brain&quot; as main keywords. Further references were integrated by cross-referencing from key articles. 155 studies out of 2696 were identified, which actually made use of AI algorithms for different purposes (diagnosis, surgical treatment, intra-operative assistance, and postoperative assessment). Artificial neural networks have risen to prominent positions among the most widely used analytical tools. Classic machine learning approaches such as support vector machine and random forest are still widely used. Task-specific algorithms are designed for solving specific problems. Brain images are one of the most used data types. AI has the possibility to improve clinicians' decision-making ability in neuroscience applications. However, major issues still need to be addressed for a better practical use of AI in the brain. To this aim, it is important to both gather comprehensive data and build explainable AI algorithms.","Segato, Marzullo, Calimeri, De Momi","https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0011697","20201024","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15971,""
"Recommendations for hemodynamic monitoring for critically ill children-expert consensus statement issued by the cardiovascular dynamics section of the European Society of Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC)","Cardiovascular instability is common in critically ill children. There is a scarcity of published high-quality studies to develop meaningful evidence-based hemodynamic monitoring guidelines and hence, with the exception of management of shock, currently there are no published guidelines for hemodynamic monitoring in children. The European Society of Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) Cardiovascular Dynamics section aimed to provide expert consensus recommendations on hemodynamic monitoring in critically ill children. Creation of a panel of experts in cardiovascular hemodynamic assessment and hemodynamic monitoring and review of relevant literature-a literature search was performed, and recommendations were developed through discussions managed following a Quaker-based consensus technique and evaluating appropriateness using a modified blind RAND/UCLA voting method. The AGREE statement was followed to prepare this document. Of 100 suggested recommendations across 12 subgroups concerning hemodynamic monitoring in critically ill children, 72 reached &quot;strong agreement,&quot; 20 &quot;weak agreement,&quot; and 2 had &quot;no agreement.&quot; Six statements were considered as redundant after rephrasing of statements following the first round of voting. The agreed 72 recommendations were then coalesced into 36 detailing four key areas of hemodynamic monitoring in the main manuscript. Due to a lack of published evidence to develop evidence-based guidelines, most of the recommendations are based upon expert consensus. These expert consensus-based recommendations may be used to guide clinical practice for hemodynamic monitoring in critically ill children, and they may serve as a basis for highlighting gaps in the knowledge base to guide further research in hemodynamic monitoring.","Singh, Villaescusa, da Cruz, Tibby, Bottari, Saxena, GuillÃƒÂ©n, Herce, Di Nardo, Cecchetti, Brierley, de Boode, Lemson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-020-03326-2","20201026","Cardiovascular instability; Children; Hemodynamic monitoring (HD); Paediatric intensive care unit (PICU); Recommendations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15972,""
"Automatic classification of scanned electronic health record documents","Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain scanned documents from a variety of sources such as identification cards, radiology reports, clinical correspondence, and many other document types. We describe the distribution of scanned documents at one health institution and describe the design and evaluation of a system to categorize documents into clinically relevant and non-clinically relevant categories as well as further sub-classifications. Our objective is to demonstrate that text classification systems can accurately classify scanned documents. We extracted text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). We then created and evaluated multiple text classification machine learning models, including both &quot;bag of words&quot; and deep learning approaches. We evaluated the system on three different levels of classification using both the entire document as input, as well as the individual pages of the document. Finally, we compared the effects of different text processing methods. A deep learning model using ClinicalBERT performed best. This model distinguished between clinically-relevant documents and not clinically-relevant documents with an accuracy of 0.973; between intermediate sub-classifications with an accuracy of 0.949; and between individual classes with an accuracy of 0.913. Within the EHR, some document categories such as &quot;external medical records&quot; may contain hundreds of scanned pages without clear document boundaries. Without further sub-classification, clinicians must view every page or risk missing clinically-relevant information. Machine learning can automatically classify these scanned documents to reduce clinician burden. Using machine learning applied to OCR-extracted text has the potential to accurately identify clinically-relevant scanned content within EHRs.","Goodrum, Roberts, Bernstam","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104302","20201030","Classification; Electronic health records; Machine learning; Optical character recognition; Patient safety; Scanned documents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15973,""
"Predicting the progression of mild cognitive impairment using machine learning: A systematic, quantitative and critical review","We performed a systematic review of studies focusing on the automatic prediction of the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, and a quantitative analysis of the methodological choices impacting performance. This review included 172 articles, from which 234 experiments were extracted. For each of them, we reported the used data set, the feature types, the algorithm type, performance and potential methodological issues. The impact of these characteristics on the performance was evaluated using a multivariate mixed effect linear regressions. We found that using cognitive, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography or potentially electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography variables significantly improved predictive performance compared to not including them, whereas including other modalities, in particular T1 magnetic resonance imaging, did not show a significant effect. The good performance of cognitive assessments questions the wide use of imaging for predicting the progression to AD and advocates for exploring further fine domain-specific cognitive assessments. We also identified several methodological issues, including the absence of a test set, or its use for feature selection or parameter tuning in nearly a fourth of the papers. Other issues, found in 15% of the studies, cast doubts on the relevance of the method to clinical practice. We also highlight that short-term predictions are likely not to be better than predicting that subjects stay stable over time. These issues highlight the importance of adhering to good practices for the use of machine learning as a decision support system for the clinical practice.","Ansart, Epelbaum, Bassignana, BÃƒÂ´ne, Bottani, Cattai, CouronnÃƒÂ©, Faouzi, Koval, Louis, Thibeau-Sutre, Wen, Wild, Burgos, Dormont, Colliot, Durrleman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101848","20201102","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; Automatic prediction; Cognition; Mild cognitive impairment; Progression; Quantitative review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15974,""
"Clinical Characteristics and Prognostic Factors for Intensive Care Unit Admission of Patients With COVID-19: Retrospective Study Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing","Many factors involved in the onset and clinical course of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are still unknown. Although big data analytics and artificial intelligence are widely used in the realms of health and medicine, researchers are only beginning to use these tools to explore the clinical characteristics and predictive factors of patients with COVID-19. Our primary objectives are to describe the clinical characteristics and determine the factors that predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission of patients with COVID-19. Determining these factors using a well-defined population can increase our understanding of the real-world epidemiology of the disease. We used a combination of classic epidemiological methods, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (for predictive modeling) to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients with COVID-19. We explored the unstructured free text in the EHRs within the Servicio de Salud de Castilla-La Mancha (SESCAM) Health Care Network (Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) from the entire population with available EHRs (1,364,924 patients) from January 1 to March 29, 2020. We extracted related clinical information regarding diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. A total of 10,504 patients with a clinical or polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified; 5519 (52.5%) were male, with a mean age of 58.2 years (SD 19.7). Upon admission, the most common symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea; however, all three symptoms occurred in fewer than half of the cases. Overall, 6.1% (83/1353) of hospitalized patients required ICU admission. Using a machine-learning, data-driven algorithm, we identified that a combination of age, fever, and tachypnea was the most parsimonious predictor of ICU admission; patients younger than 56 years, without tachypnea, and temperature &lt;39 degrees Celsius (or &gt;39 Ã‚ÂºC without respiratory crackles) were not admitted to the ICU. In contrast, patients with COVID-19 aged 40 to 79 years were likely to be admitted to the ICU if they had tachypnea and delayed their visit to the emergency department after being seen in primary care. Our results show that a combination of easily obtainable clinical variables (age, fever, and tachypnea with or without respiratory crackles) predicts whether patients with COVID-19 will require ICU admission.","Izquierdo, Ancochea, Soriano","https://doi.org/10.2196/21801","20201030","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; artificial intelligence; big data; electronic health records; predictive model; tachypnea","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15975,""
"The Effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence Conversational Agents in Health Care: Systematic Review","The high demand for health care services and the growing capability of artificial intelligence have led to the development of conversational agents designed to support a variety of health-related activities, including behavior change, treatment support, health monitoring, training, triage, and screening support. Automation of these tasks could free clinicians to focus on more complex work and increase the accessibility to health care services for the public. An overarching assessment of the acceptability, usability, and effectiveness of these agents in health care is needed to collate the evidence so that future development can target areas for improvement and potential for sustainable adoption. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness and usability of conversational agents in health care and identify the elements that users like and dislike to inform future research and development of these agents. PubMed, Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica dataBASE), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library were systematically searched for articles published since 2008 that evaluated unconstrained natural language processing conversational agents used in health care. EndNote (version X9, Clarivate Analytics) reference management software was used for initial screening, and full-text screening was conducted by 1 reviewer. Data were extracted, and the risk of bias was assessed by one reviewer and validated by another. A total of 31 studies were selected and included a variety of conversational agents, including 14 chatbots (2 of which were voice chatbots), 6 embodied conversational agents (3 of which were interactive voice response calls, virtual patients, and speech recognition screening systems), 1 contextual question-answering agent, and 1 voice recognition triage system. Overall, the evidence reported was mostly positive or mixed. Usability and satisfaction performed well (27/30 and 26/31), and positive or mixed effectiveness was found in three-quarters of the studies (23/30). However, there were several limitations of the agents highlighted in specific qualitative feedback. The studies generally reported positive or mixed evidence for the effectiveness, usability, and satisfactoriness of the conversational agents investigated, but qualitative user perceptions were more mixed. The quality of many of the studies was limited, and improved study design and reporting are necessary to more accurately evaluate the usefulness of the agents in health care and identify key areas for improvement. Further research should also analyze the cost-effectiveness, privacy, and security of the agents.

"Improving ASR Systems for Children with Autism and Language Impairment Using Domain-Focused DNN Transfer Techniques","This study explores building and improving an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system for children aged 6-9 years and diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), language impairment (LI), or both. Working with only 1.5 hours of target data in which children perform the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals Recalling Sentences task, we apply deep neural network (DNN) weight transfer techniques to adapt a large DNN model trained on the LibriSpeech corpus of adult speech. To begin, we aim to find the best proportional training rates of the DNN layers. Our best configuration yields a 29.38% word error rate (WER). Using this configuration, we explore the effects of quantity and similarity of data augmentation in transfer learning. We augment our training with portions of the OGI Kids' Corpus, adding 4.6 hours of typically developing speakers aged kindergarten through 3<sup>rd</sup> grade. We find that 2<sup>nd</sup> grade data alone - approximately the mean age of the target data - outperforms other grades and all the sets combined. Doubling the data for 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> grade, we again compare each grade as well as pairs of grades.

"Seq-SymRF: a random forest model predicts potential miRNA-disease associations based on information of sequences and clinical symptoms","Increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs play a vital role in biological processes and are closely related to various human diseases. Research on miRNA-disease associations is helpful not only for disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment, but also for new drug identification and lead compound discovery. A novel sequence- and symptom-based random forest algorithm model (Seq-SymRF) was developed to identify potential associations between miRNA and disease. Features derived from sequence information and clinical symptoms were utilized to characterize miRNA and disease, respectively. Moreover, the clustering method by calculating the Euclidean distance was adopted to construct reliable negative samples. Based on the fivefold cross-validation, Seq-SymRF achieved the accuracy of 98.00%, specificity of 99.43%, sensitivity of 96.58%, precision of 99.40% and Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.9604, respectively. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve and precision recall curve were 0.9967 and 0.9975, respectively. Additionally, case studies were implemented with leukemia, breast neoplasms and hsa-mir-21. Most of the top-25 predicted disease-related miRNAs (19/25 for leukemia; 20/25 for breast neoplasms) and 15 of top-25 predicted miRNA-related diseases were verified by literature and dbDEMC database. It is anticipated that Seq-SymRF could be regarded as a powerful high-throughput virtual screening tool for drug research and development.

"Texture features from computed tomography correlate with markers of severity in acute alcohol-associated hepatitis","The aim of this study was to use texture analysis to establish quantitative CT-based imaging features to predict clinical severity in patients with acute alcohol-associated hepatitis (AAH). A secondary aim was to compare the performance of texture analysis to deep learning. In this study, mathematical texture features were extracted from CT slices of the liver for 34 patients with a diagnosis of AAH and 35 control patients. Recursive feature elimination using random forest (RFE-RF) was used to identify the best combination of features to distinguish AAH from controls. These features were subsequently used as predictors to determine associated clinical values. To compare machine learning with deep learning approaches, a 2D dense convolutional neural network (CNN) was implemented and trained for the classification task of AAH. RFE-RF identified 23 top features used to classify AAH images, and the subsequent model demonstrated an accuracy of 82.4% in the test set. The deep learning CNN demonstrated an accuracy of 70% in the test set. We show that texture features of the liver are unique in AAH and are candidate quantitative biomarkers that can be used in prospective studies to predict the severity and outcomes of patients with AAH.","Tana, McCoy, Lee, Patel, Lin, Ohliger","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74599-4","20201024","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15979,""
"Old Drugs with New Tricks; Paradigm in Drug Development Pipeline for Alzheimer's Disease","The most common reason behind dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD) and it is predicted to be the third lifethreatening disease apart from stroke and cancer for the geriatric population. Till now only four drugs are available in the market for symptomatic relief. The complex nature of disease pathophysiology and lack of concrete evidences of molecular targets are the major hurdles for developing new drug to treat AD. The the rate of attrition of many advanced drugs at clinical stages, makes the de novo discovery process very expensive. Alternatively, Drug Repurposing (DR) is an attractive tool to develop drugs for AD in a less tedious and economic way. Therefore, continuous efforts are being made to develop a new drug for AD by repursing old drugs through screening and data mining. For example, the survey in the drug pipeline for Phase III clinical trials (till February 2019) which has 27 candidates, and around half of the number are drugs which have already been approved for other indications. Although in the past the drug repurposing process for AD has been reviewed in the context of disease areas, molecular targets, there is no systematic review of repurposed drugs for AD from the recent drug development pipeline (2019-2020).

"Systematic review of context-aware digital behavior change interventions to improve health","Health risk behaviors are leading contributors to morbidity, premature mortality associated with chronic diseases, and escalating health costs. However, traditional interventions to change health behaviors often have modest effects, and limited applicability and scale. To better support health improvement goals across the care continuum, new approaches incorporating various smart technologies are being utilized to create more individualized digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs). The purpose of this study is to identify context-aware DBCIs that provide individualized interventions to improve health. A systematic review of published literature (2013-2020) was conducted from multiple databases and manual searches. All included DBCIs were context-aware, automated digital health technologies, whereby user input, activity, or location influenced the intervention. Included studies addressed explicit health behaviors and reported data of behavior change outcomes. Data extracted from studies included study design, type of intervention, including its functions and technologies used, behavior change techniques, and target health behavior and outcomes data. Thirty-three articles were included, comprising mobile health (mHealth) applications, Internet of Things wearables/sensors, and internet-based web applications. The most frequently adopted behavior change techniques were in the groupings of feedback and monitoring, shaping knowledge, associations, and goals and planning. Technologies used to apply these in a context-aware, automated fashion included analytic and artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning and symbolic reasoning) methods requiring various degrees of access to data. Studies demonstrated improvements in physical activity, dietary behaviors, medication adherence, and sun protection practices. Context-aware DBCIs effectively supported behavior change to improve users' health behaviors.","Thomas Craig, Morgan, Chen, Michie, Fusco, Snowdon, Scheufele, Gagliardi, Sill","https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibaa099","20201021","Artificial intelligence; Digital behavior change interventions; Internet of Things; Machine learning; mHealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15981,""
"Use of zebrafish larvae lateral line to study protection against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity: A scoping review","The present review aimed to consolidate and analyze the recent information about the use of zebrafish in studies concerning cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and otoprotection. The PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databanks were searched using the following MESH terms: zebrafish, cisplatin, ototoxicity. The identified publications were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria and the 26 qualifying manuscripts were included in the full-text analysis. The experimental protocols, including cisplatin concentrations, the exposure duration and the outcome measurements used in zebrafish larvae studies, were evaluated and the reported knowledge was summarized. Twenty-six substances protecting from cisplatin-induced toxicity were identified with the use of zebrafish larvae. These substances include quinine, salvianolic acid B, berbamine 6, benzamil, quercetin, dexmedetomidine, dexamethsanone, quinoxaline, edaravone, apocynin, dimethyl sulfoxide, KR-22335, SRT1720, ORC-13661, 3-MA, D-methionine, mdivi-1, FUT-175, rapamycin, Z-LLF-CHO, ATX, NAC, CYM-5478, CHCP1, CHCP2 and leupeptin. The otoprotective effects of compounds were attributed to their anti-ROS, anti-apoptotic and cisplatin uptake-blocking properties. The broadest range of protection was achieved when the experimental flow used preconditioning with an otoprotective compound and later a co-incubation with cisplatin. Protection against a high concentration of cisplatin was observed only in protocols using short exposure times (4 and 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°h). The data extracted from the selected papers confirm that despite the differences between the human and the zebra fish hearing thresholds (as affected by cisplatin), the sensory cells of zebrafish and larval zebrafish are a valuable tool which could be used: (i) for the discovery of novel otoprotective substances and compounds; (ii) to screen their side effects and (iii) to extend the knowledge on the mechanisms of cisplatin-induced inner ear damage. For future studies, the development of a consensus experimental protocol is highly recommended.","Domarecka, Skarzynska, Szczepek, Hatzopoulos","https://doi.org/10.1177/2058738420959554","20201022","animal models; cisplatin; otoprotection; ototoxicity; zebrafish","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15982,""
"Fusion of medical imaging and electronic health records using deep learning: a systematic review and implementation guidelines","Advancements in deep learning techniques carry the potential to make significant contributions to healthcare, particularly in fields that utilize medical imaging for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions. The current state-of-the-art deep learning models for radiology applications consider only pixel-value information without data informing clinical context. Yet in practice, pertinent and accurate non-imaging data based on the clinical history and laboratory data enable physicians to interpret imaging findings in the appropriate clinical context, leading to a higher diagnostic accuracy, informative clinical decision making, and improved patient outcomes. To achieve a similar goal using deep learning, medical imaging pixel-based models must also achieve the capability to process contextual data from electronic health records (EHR) in addition to pixel data. In this paper, we describe different data fusion techniques that can be applied to combine medical imaging with EHR, and systematically review medical data fusion literature published between 2012 and 2020. We conducted a systematic search on PubMed and Scopus for original research articles leveraging deep learning for fusion of multimodality data. In total, we screened 985 studies and extracted data from 17 papers. By means of this systematic review, we present current knowledge, summarize important results and provide implementation guidelines to serve as a reference for researchers interested in the application of multimodal fusion in medical imaging.","Huang, Pareek, Seyyedi, Banerjee, Lungren","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-020-00341-z","20201023","Data integration; Machine learning; Medical imaging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15983,""
"Phenotyping severity of patient-centered outcomes using clinical notes: A prostate cancer use case","A learning health system (LHS) must improve care in ways that are meaningful to patients, integrating patient-centered outcomes (PCOs) into core infrastructure. PCOs are common following cancer treatment, such as urinary incontinence (UI) following prostatectomy. However, PCOs are not systematically recorded because they can only be described by the patient, are subjective and captured as unstructured text in the electronic health record (EHR). Therefore, PCOs pose significant challenges for phenotyping patients. Here, we present a natural language processing (NLP) approach for phenotyping patients with UI to classify their disease into severity subtypes, which can increase opportunities to provide precision-based therapy and promote a value-based delivery system. Patients undergoing prostate cancer treatment from 2008 to 2018 were identified at an academic medical center. Using a hybrid NLP pipeline that combines rule-based and deep learning methodologies, we classified positive UI cases as mild, moderate, and severe by mining clinical notes. The rule-based model accurately classified UI into disease severity categories (accuracy: 0.86), which outperformed the deep learning model (accuracy: 0.73). In the deep learning model, the recall rates for mild and moderate group were higher than the precision rate (0.78 and 0.79, respectively). A hybrid model that combined both methods did not improve the accuracy of the rule-based model but did outperform the deep learning model (accuracy: 0.75). Phenotyping patients based on indication and severity of PCOs is essential to advance a patient centered LHS. EHRs contain valuable information on PCOs and by using NLP methods, it is feasible to accurately and efficiently phenotype PCO severity. Phenotyping must extend beyond the identification of disease to provide classification of disease severity that can be used to guide treatment and inform shared decision-making. Our methods demonstrate a path to a patient centered LHS that could advance precision medicine.","Bozkurt, Paul, Coquet, Sun, Banerjee, Brooks, Hernandez-Boussard","https://doi.org/10.1002/lrh2.10237","20201023","deep phenotyping; natural language processing; prostate cancer; urinary incontinence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15984,""
"Application of BERT to Enable Gene Classification Based on Clinical Evidence","The identification of profiled cancer-related genes plays an essential role in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Based on literature research, the classification of genetic mutations continues to be done manually nowadays. Manual classification of genetic mutations is pathologist-dependent, subjective, and time-consuming. To improve the accuracy of clinical interpretation, scientists have proposed computational-based approaches for automatic analysis of mutations with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. Nevertheless, some challenges, such as multiple classifications, the complexity of texts, redundant descriptions, and inconsistent interpretation, have limited the development of algorithms. To overcome these difficulties, we have adapted a deep learning method named Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to classify genetic mutations based on text evidence from an annotated database. During the training, three challenging features such as the extreme length of texts, biased data presentation, and high repeatability were addressed. Finally, the BERT+abstract demonstrates satisfactory results with 0.80 logarithmic loss, 0.6837 recall, and 0.705 <i>F</i>-measure. It is feasible for BERT to classify the genomic mutation text within literature-based datasets. Consequently, BERT is a practical tool for facilitating and significantly speeding up cancer research towards tumor progression, diagnosis, and the design of more precise and effective treatments.","Su, Xiang, Xie, Yu, Dong, Yang, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/5491963","20201022","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15985,""
"Significant Increase of Sexual Dysfunction in Patients With Renal Failure Receiving Renal Replacement Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","It has been shown that sexual dysfunction (SD) is highly prevalent among patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), and starting renal replacement therapy may even increase it. However, SD is an infrequently reported problem in these treated patients. To investigate the prevalence of SD among patients with CRF undergoing renal replacement therapy, by a meta-analysis method. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for all studies assessing sexual function in patients with CRF receiving renal replacement therapy from January 2000 to April 2020. Relative risk (RR) with 95% CIs was used for analysis to assess the risk of SD in patients with CRF receiving renal replacement therapy. The cross-sectional study quality methodology checklist was used for the cross-sectional study. The methodologic quality of the case-control and cohort studies was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were pooled for the random-effect model. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess potential bias. The Begg and Egger tests were used for publication bias analysis. The prevalence of SD among patients with CRF receiving renal replacement therapy was summarized using pooled RR and 95% CI. This meta-analysis included 3,725 participants from 10 studies. Of these, 737 were patients with CRF receiving renal replacement therapy. The mean age of participants ranged from 32.75 to 56.1Ã‚Â years. Based on the random-effect model, synthesis of results demonstrated that the prevalence of SD was significantly increased among patients with CRF receiving renal replacement therapy in women (RRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.07, 95% CI: 1.47-2.91, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .000; heterogeneity: I<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 78.7%, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .000) and in men (RRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.95, 95% CI: 2.16-4.02, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .000; heterogeneity: I<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 86.1%, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .000). Estimates of the total effects were generally consistent in the sensitivity analysis. No evidence of publication bias was observed. Patients with CRF receiving renal replacement therapy had a significantly increased risk of SD, which suggests that clinicians should evaluate sexual function, when managing patients with CRF receiving renal replacement therapy. This is the first study to explore the prevalence of SD among patients with CRF undergoing renal replacement therapy based on all available epidemiologic studies. However, all included studies were an observational design, which may downgrade this evidence. The prevalence of SD is significantly increased among patients with CRF receiving renal replacement therapy. More research studies are warranted to clarify the relationship.

"A Review of Various Machine Learning Techniques for Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Images","This paper endeavors to identify an expedient approach for the detection of the brain tumor in MRI images. The detection of tumor is based on i) review of the machine learning approach for the identification of brain tumor and ii) review of a suitable approach for brain tumor detection. This review focuses on different imaging techniques such as X-rays, PET, CT- Scan, and MRI. This survey identifies a different approach with better accuracy for tumor detection. This further includes the image processing method. In most applications, machine learning shows better performance than manual segmentation of the brain tumors from MRI images as it is a difficult and time-consuming task. For fast and better computational results, radiology used a different approach with MRI, CT-scan, X-ray, and PET. Furthermore, summarizing the literature, this paper also provides a critical evaluation of the surveyed literature which reveals new facets of research. The problem faced by the researchers during brain tumor detection techniques and machine learning applications for clinical settings have also been discussed.","Bajaj, Chouhan","https://doi.org/10.2174/1573405615666190903144419","20201028","Brain tumor; MRI; classifiers; data mining techniques; feature selection; filtering techniques","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15987,""
"Efficacy and safety of acupuncture in patients with cancer-related fatigue: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is considered a common complication of cancer or cancer treatment, which has a serious adverse effect on the life and of cancer patients, leading to a decline in their quality of life (QoL). The existing clinical trials revealed that acupuncture has a positive effect on CRF, and there are fewer adverse events confirmed in the corresponding systematic review. However, in recent years, new studies on using acupuncture to treat CRF were conducted, so in order to evaluate its efficacy, an updated systematic review. This protocol provides research methods for systematic review and meta-analysis of the safety and effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of CRF. We will searched the randomized controlled trial literature of acupuncture treatment for CRF in 4 English and 4 Chinese databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biomedical Literature Database(CBM), China Science Journal Database (VIP), and Wanfang Database. Simultaneously, other resources are manually retrieved which include reference lists of identified publications, conference articles, and grey literature. We also included the clinical randomized controlled trials of acupuncture treatment for CRF in the study. The search language is limited to Chinese and English. Two trained reviewers independently completed research screening, data extraction, and research quality assessment. RevMan (V.5.3) software was used to perform data statistical analysis and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the quality of evidence. This study is based on past and present clinical evidence to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture treatment for CRF. Through this systematic review, we will provide the latest high-quality evidence of whether acupuncture treatment for CRF is effective and safe and also provide a theoretical basis for clinicians to choose acupuncture for the treatment of CRF.

"Identification of the Sensory Dependent Locations of the Shoulder Joint to Optimize Surgical Approaches and Reduce Postoperative Pain: A Systematic Review","Treatment of post-surgical pain is predicated by an understanding of pain generators. The purpose of this review is to identify sensory dependent areas of the shoulder and discuss their correlation in treating postoperative pain. Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews were searched (key terms: &quot;Nociception&quot; or &quot;sensory pain receptors&quot; or &quot;pain map&quot; or &quot;neuroanatomy and shoulder&quot; or &quot;rotator cuff&quot;) to identify studies in the current literature (1966-2018) regarding sensory innervation of the shoulder and rotator cuff. The search was limited to the English language, human studies, and publication types to reviews and clinical studies. Articles written in other languages besides English, animal studies, abstracts, and conference notes were excluded. Each search result was investigated for relevant physiological information of the nerve endings and nociceptors as well as pertinent information and figures that illustrated the location of the identified receptors. A total of 12 articles were identified that addressed the sensory innervation of the shoulder. The shoulder capsule has the highest sensory nerve density. The attachment sites between the labrum and the capsule and glenoid rim were also found to be highly sensory dependent, in contrast to the peri-core zone at the capsulolabral junction, which was found to be less concentrated with fascicles and sensory nerve endings. The subacromial bursa is also a highly sensory dependent structure, with a more concentrated neural network on the coracoacromial side compared to other quadrants of the bursa. Cutaneous locations of sensory fibers on the shoulder are best defined by mapping the pressure pain threshold (PPT) of various locations on the shoulder. The most sensory dependent locations of the shoulder were found to be the posterior border of the acromion, the glenohumeral joint, the anterior deltoid, and the upper trapezius. This review examined the origin of pain in the shoulder, the location of cutaneous pain receptors, and receptors in each major part of the shoulder. Providing analgesia to these densely innervated areas of the shoulder can potentially reduce pain associated with surgical trauma. In addition, knowledge of the sensory dependent areas of the shoulder may elicit consideration of alternative incision sites and surgical protocols to decrease the insult to nociceptors in these locations. These changes could possibly decrease the narcotic requirement in the postoperative period.","Park, Liu, Sethi, McMillan, Ford, Shepard, Amin","https://www.google.com/search?q=Identification+of+the+Sensory+Dependent+Locations+of+the+Shoulder+Joint+to+Optimize+Surgical+Approaches+and+Reduce+Postoperative+Pain:+A+Systematic+Review.","20201020","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15989,""
"How the COVID-19 pandemic favored the adoption of digital technologies in healthcare: a systematic review of early scientific literature","The COVID-19 pandemic is favoring the digital transition in many industries and in the society as a whole. Healthcare responded to the first phase of the pandemic through the rapid adoption of digital solutions and advanced technology tools. The aim of this study is to describe which digital solutions have been reported in the early scientific literature to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and health systems. We conducted a systematic review of COVID-19 early literature (from January 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020) searching MEDLINE and medRxiv with terms considered adequate to find relevant literature on the use of digital technologies in response to the pandemic. We extracted study characteristics such as paper title, journal, publication date, and categorized the retrieved papers by type of technology, and patient needs addressed. We built a scoring rubric by cross-classifying the patient needs with the type of technology. We also extracted information and classified each technology reported by the selected articles according to healthcare system targets, grade of innovation, and scalability to other geographical areas. The search identified 269 articles, of which 124 full-text articles were assessed and included in the review after screening. Of selected articles, most of them addressed the use of digital technologies for diagnosis, surveillance and prevention. We report that digital solutions and innovative technologies have mainly been proposed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In particular, within the reviewed articles we identified numerous suggestions on the use of artificial-intelligence-powered tools for the diagnosis and screening of COVID-19. Digital technologies are useful also for prevention and surveillance measures, for example through contact-tracing apps or monitoring of internet searches and social media usage. Fewer scientific contributions address the use of digital technologies for lifestyle empowerment or patient engagement. In the field of diagnosis, digital solutions that integrate with the traditional methods, such as AI-based diagnostic algorithms based both on imaging and/or clinical data, seem promising. As for surveillance, digital apps have already proven their effectiveness, but problems related to privacy and usability remain. For other patient needs, several solutions have been proposed using, for example, telemedicine or telehealth tools. These have long been available, but perhaps this historical moment could actually favor their definitive large-scale adoption. It is worth taking advantage of the push given by the crisis and important to keep track of the digital solutions proposed today to implement tomorrow's best practices and models of care, and to adopt at least some of the solutions proposed in the scientific literature, especially in those national health systems which in recent years proved to be particularly resistant to the digital transition.","Golinelli, Boetto, Carullo, Nuzzolese, Landini, Fantini","https://doi.org/10.2196/22280","20201020","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15990,""
"Development of a Portable Tool to Identify Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Using Clinical Notes From the Electronic Medical Record","The electronic medical record contains a wealth of information buried in free text. We created a natural language processing algorithm to identify patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) using text alone. We created 3 data sets from patients with at least one AF billing code from 2010 to 2017: a training set (n=886), an internal validation set from site no. 1 (n=285), and an external validation set from site no. 2 (n=276). A team of clinicians reviewed and adjudicated patients as AF present or absent, which served as the reference standard. We trained 54 algorithms to classify each patient, varying the model, number of features, number of stop words, and the method used to create the feature set. The algorithm with the highest F-score (the harmonic mean of sensitivity and positive predictive value) in the training set was applied to the validation sets. F-scores and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves were compared between site no. 1 and site no. 2 using bootstrapping. Adjudicated AF prevalence was 75.1% at site no. 1 and 86.2% at site no. 2. Among 54 algorithms, the best performing model was logistic regression, using 1000 features, 100 stop words, and term frequency-inverse document frequency method to create the feature set, with sensitivity 92.8%, specificity 93.9%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93 in the training set. The performance at site no. 1 was sensitivity 92.5%, specificity 88.7%, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91. The performance at site no. 2 was sensitivity 89.5%, specificity 71.1%, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80. The F-score was lower at site no. 2 compared with site no. 1 (92.5% [SD, 1.1%] versus 94.2% [SD, 1.1%]; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). We developed a natural language processing algorithm to identify patients with AF using text alone, with &gt;90% F-score at 2 separate sites.

"Role of machine learning in gait analysis: a review","Human biomechanics and gait form an integral part of life. The gait analysis involves a large number of interdependent parameters that were difficult to interpret due to a vast amount of data and their inter-relations. To simplify evaluation, the integration of machine learning (ML) with biomechanics is a promising solution. The purpose of this review is to familiarise the readers with key directions of implementation of ML techniques for gait analysis and gait rehabilitation. An extensive literature survey was based on research articles from nine databases published from 1980 to 2019. With over 943 studies identified, finally, 43 studies met the inclusion criteria. The outcome reported illustrates that supervised ML techniques showed accuracies above 90% in the identified gait analysis domain. The statistical results revealed support vector machine (SVM) as the best classifier (mean-score = 0.87Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.07) with remarkable generalisation capability even on small to medium datasets. It has also been analysed that the control strategies for gait rehabilitation are benefitted from reinforcement learning and (deep) neural-networks due to their ability to capture participants' variability.

"Comparison of a traditional systematic review approach with review-of-reviews and semi-automation as strategies to update the evidence","The exponential growth of the biomedical literature necessitates investigating strategies to reduce systematic reviewer burden while maintaining the high standards of systematic review validity and comprehensiveness. We compared the traditional systematic review screening process with (1) a review-of-reviews (ROR) screening approach and (2) a semi-automation screening approach using two publicly available tools (RobotAnalyst and AbstrackR) and different types of training sets (randomly selected citations subjected to dual-review at the title-abstract stage, highly curated citations dually reviewed at the full-text stage, and a combination of the two). We evaluated performance measures of sensitivity, specificity, missed citations, and workload burden RESULTS: The ROR approach for treatments of early-stage prostate cancer had a poor sensitivity (0.54) and studies missed by the ROR approach tended to be of head-to-head comparisons of active treatments, observational studies, and outcomes of physical harms and quality of life. Title and abstract screening incorporating semi-automation only resulted in a sensitivity of 100% at high levels of reviewer burden (review of 99% of citations). A highly curated, smaller-sized, training set (n = 125) performed similarly to a larger training set of random citations (n = 938). Two approaches to rapidly update SRs-review-of-reviews and semi-automation-failed to demonstrate reduced workload burden while maintaining an acceptable level of sensitivity. We suggest careful evaluation of the ROR approach through comparison of inclusion criteria and targeted searches to fill evidence gaps as well as further research of semi-automation use, including more study of highly curated training sets.","Reddy, Patel, Weyrich, Fenton, Viswanathan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-020-01450-2","20201023","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15993,""
"Sustained acoustic medicine as a non-surgical and non-opioid knee osteoarthritis treatment option: a health economic cost-effectiveness analysis for symptom management","Patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis (OA) and presenting with symptoms are seeking conservative treatment options to reduce pain, improve function, and avoid surgery. Sustained acoustic medicine (SAM), a multi-hour treatment has demonstrated improved clinical outcomes for patients with knee OA. The purpose of this analysis was to compare the costs and effectiveness of multi-hour SAM treatment versus the standard of care (SOC) over a 6-month timeframe for OA symptom management. A decision tree analysis was used to compare the costs and effectiveness of SAM treatment versus SOC in patients with OA. Probabilities of success for OA treatment and effectiveness were derived from the literature using systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Costs were derived from Medicare payment rates and manufacturer prices. Functional effectiveness was measured as the effect size of a therapy and treatment pathways compared to a SOC treatment pathway. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which cost variables had the greatest effect on deciding which option was the least costly. An incremental cost-effectiveness plot comparing SAM treatment vs. SOC was also generated using 1000 iterations of the model. Lastly, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as the (cost of SAM minus cost of SOC) divided by (functional effectiveness of SAM minus functional effectiveness of SOC). Base case demonstrated that over 6 months, the cost and functional effectiveness of SAM was $8641 and 0.52 versus SOC at: $6281 and 0.39, respectively. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that in order for SAM to be the less expensive option, the cost per 15-min session of PT would need to be greater than $88, or SAM would need to be priced at less than or equal to $2276. Incremental cost-effectiveness demonstrated that most of the time (84%) SAM treatment resulted in improved functional effectiveness but at a higher cost than SOC. In patients with osteoarthritis, SAM treatment demonstrated improved pain and functional gains compared to SOC but at an increased cost. Based on the SAM treatment ICER score being Ã¢â€°Â¤ $50,000, it appears that SAM is a cost-effective treatment for knee OA.","Best, Petterson, Plancher","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-020-01987-x","20201023","Cost-effect analysis; Health care cost; Osteoarthritis; Physical therapy; Socio-economical impact; Sustained Acoustic Medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15994,""
"Artificial intelligence and machine learning in orthopedic surgery: a systematic review protocol","Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are interwoven into our everyday lives and have grown enormously in some major fields in medicine including cardiology and radiology. While these specialties have quickly embraced AI and ML, orthopedic surgery has been slower to do so. Fortunately, there has been a recent surge in new research emphasizing the need for a systematic review. The primary objective of this systematic review will be to provide an update on the advances of AI and ML in the field of orthopedic surgery. The secondary objectives will be to evaluate the applications of AI and ML in providing a clinical diagnosis and predicting post-operative outcomes and complications in orthopedic surgery. A systematic search will be conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases for articles written in English, Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese language articles published up to September 2020. References will be screened and assessed for eligibility by at least two independent reviewers as per PRISMA guidelines. Studies must apply to orthopedic interventions and acute and chronic orthopedic musculoskeletal injuries to be considered eligible. Studies will be excluded if they are animal studies and do not relate to orthopedic interventions or if no clinical data were produced. Gold standard processes and practices to obtain a clinical diagnosis and predict post-operative outcomes shall be compared with and without the use of ML algorithms. Any case reports and other primary studies assessing the prediction rate of post-operative outcomes or the ability to identify a diagnosis in orthopedic surgery will be included. Systematic reviews or literature reviews will be examined to identify further studies for inclusion, and the results of meta-analyses will not be included in the analysis. Our findings will evaluate the advances of AI and ML in the field of orthopedic surgery. We expect to find a large quantity of uncontrolled studies and a smaller subset of articles describing actual applications and outcomes for clinical care.

"Brain Metastasis Detection using Machine Learning: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Accurate detection of brain metastasis (BM) is important for cancer patients. We aimed to systematically review the performance and quality of machine-learning-based BM detection on MRI in the relevant literature. A systematic literature search was performed for relevant studies reported before April 27, 2020. We assessed the quality of the studies using modified tailored questionnaires of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) criteria and the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging. Pooled detectability was calculated using an inverse-variance weighting model. A total of 12 studies were included, which showed a clear transition from classical machine learning (cML) to deep learning (DL) after 2018. The studies on DL used a larger sample size than those on cML. The cML and DL groups also differed in the composition of the data set, and technical details such as data augmentation. The pooled proportion of detectability of BM were 88.7% (95% CI, 84-93%) and 90.1% (95% CI, 84-95%) in the cML and DL groups, respectively. The false-positive rate per person was lower in the DL group than the cML group (10 vs. 135, P &lt; 0.001).

"Natural Language Processing in Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","The aim of this study was to systematically assess the application and potential benefits of natural language processing (NLP) in surgical outcomes research. Widespread implementation of electronic health records (EHRs) has generated a massive patient data source. Traditional methods of data capture, such as billing codes and/or manual review of free-text narratives in EHRs, are highly labor-intensive, costly, subjective, and potentially prone to bias. A literature search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase identified all articles published starting in 2000 that used NLP models to assess perioperative surgical outcomes. Evaluation metrics of NLP systems were assessed by means of pooled analysis and meta-analysis. Qualitative synthesis was carried out to assess the results and risk of bias on outcomes. The present study included 29 articles, with over half (n = 15) published after 2018. The most common outcome identified using NLP was postoperative complications (n = 14). Compared to traditional non-NLP models, NLP models identified postoperative complications with higher sensitivity [0.92 (0.87-0.95) vs 0.58 (0.33-0.79), P &lt; 0.001]. The specificities were comparable at 0.99 (0.96-1.00) and 0.98 (0.95-0.99), respectively. Using summary of likelihood ratio matrices, traditional non-NLP models have clinical utility for confirming documentation of outcomes/diagnoses, whereas NLP models may be reliably utilized for both confirming and ruling out documentation of outcomes/diagnoses. NLP usage to extract a range of surgical outcomes, particularly postoperative complications, is accelerating across disciplines and areas of clinical outcomes research. NLP and traditional non-NLP approaches demonstrate similar performance measures, but NLP is superior in ruling out documentation of surgical outcomes.","Mellia, Basta, Toyoda, Othman, Elfanagely, Morris, Torre-Healy, Ungar, Fischer","https://doi.org/10.1097/SLA.0000000000004419","20201019","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15997,""
"Silane Coupling Agents are Beneficial for Resin Composite Repair: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of In Vitro Studies","To systematically review the literature to determine whether silane combined with adhesive application improves the repair bond strength of direct methacrylate-based resin composites in comparison to the use of an adhesive alone. The literature up to December 2019 was searched through PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Lilacs databases with no publication year or language limits. From 676 potentially eligible studies, 81 were selected for full-text analysis, and 19 were included in the systematic review. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random effects model to calculate pooled mean differences between adhesive- vs silane-plus-adhesive surface treatments (global meta-analysis) and considering subgroup analyses (immediate and aged repair bond strengths and type of silane - hydrolyzed or nonhydrolyzed). Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan5.3 at a significance level of 5%. Global meta-analysis showed that the use of silane prior to adhesive application produced significantly higher repair bond strengths (p=0.003). A higher mean difference (effect size: 7.30, 95% CI: 2.91-17.51) between groups was found when nonhydrolyzed silanes were used. The heterogeneity was high. Studies scored between medium and high risk of bias. An additional silane application step could increase the repair bond strength of methacrylate-based resin composites.","Mendes, Loomans, Opdam, Silva, Casagrande, Lenzi","https://doi.org/10.3290/j.jad.a45175","20201020","bond strength; methacrylate functional silane; repair; resin-based composites; Dental Bonding; Dental Cements; Materials Testing; Resin Cements; Silanes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15998,""
"Reversal learning in young and middle-age neurotypicals: Individual difference reaction time considerations","Reversal learning is frequently used to assess components of executive function that contribute to understanding age-related cognitive differences. Reaction time (RT) is less characterized in the reversal learning literature, perhaps due to the daunting task of analyzing the entire RT distribution, but has been deemed a generally sensitive measure of cognitive aging. The current study extends our prior work to further characterize distributional properties of the reversal RT distribution and to distinguish groups of individuals with fractionated profiles of performance, which may be of clinical importance within the context of cognitive aging. Participant sample included young (<i>n</i> =Ã‚Â 43) and community-dwelling, healthy, middle-aged (<i>n</i> =Ã‚Â 139) adults. To explore individual differences, recursive partitioning analysis achieved a high classification rate by specifying decision tree rules that split participants into young and middle-aged groups. Mu (ÃŽÂ¼, efficient RT) was the most successful parameter in distinguishing age groups while sigma ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mi>ÃÆ’</mml:mi> <mml:mo>)</mml:mo> </mml:math> and tau ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mi>Ãâ€ž</mml:mi> </mml:math> , ex-Gaussian indices of intra-individual variability) revealed more subtle individual differences. Accuracy measures did not contribute to separating the groups, suggesting that fractionated components of RT, as opposed to accuracy, can distinguish differences between young and middle-aged participants.","Osmon, Leclaire, Driscoll, Zolliecoffer","https://doi.org/10.1080/13803395.2020.1825635","20201019","Reversal learning; ex-Gaussian; reaction time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",15999,""
"The Effect of Yoga Interventions on Cancer-Related Fatigue and Quality of Life for Women with Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","Women with breast cancer (BC) are living longer with debilitating side effects such as cancer-related fatigue (CRF) that affect overall well-being. Yoga promotes health, well-being and may be beneficial in reducing CRF. Although there have been previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the effects of yoga on CRF and quality of life (QOL) remain unclear, particularly in comparison with other types of physical activity (PA). Our objective is to carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of yoga on CRF and QOL in women with BC. Electronic databases were searched (MEDLINE, Embase Classic+Embase and EMB Reviews, Cochrane Central CT) from inception to May 2018. Randomized controlled trials were included if they were full text, in English, included a yoga intervention, a comparator (including non-PA usual care or alternate PA intervention), and reported on CRF or QOL. Effects of yoga were pooled using standardized mean difference (SMD) via a random effects model. Of the 2468 records retrieved, 24 trials were included; 18 studies compared yoga to a non-PA comparator and 6 to a PA comparator. Yoga demonstrated statistically significant improvements in CRF over non-PA (SMD -0.30 [-0.51; -0.08]) but not PA (SMD -0.17 [-0.50; 0.17]) comparators. Additionally, yoga demonstrated statistically significant improvements in QOL over non-PA (SMD -0.27 [-0.46; -0.07]) but not PA (SMD 0.04 [-0.22; +0.31]) comparators. This meta-analysis found that yoga provides small to medium improvements in CRF and QOL compared to non-PA, but not in comparison to other PA interventions.","O'Neill, Samaroo, Lopez, Tomlinson, Santa Mina, Sabiston, Culos-Reed, Alibhai","https://doi.org/10.1177/1534735420959882","20201019","breast cancer; cancer-related fatigue; meta-analysis; physical activity; quality of life; systematic review; yoga","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16000,""
"Heart Rate Variability in the Perinatal Period: A Critical and Conceptual Review","Neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) greatly expand the use of technology. There is a need to accurately diagnose discomfort, pain, and complications, such as sepsis, mainly before they occur. While specific treatments are possible, they are often time-consuming, invasive, or painful, with detrimental effects for the development of the infant. In the last 40 years, heart rate variability (HRV) has emerged as a non-invasive measurement to monitor newborns and infants, but it still is underused. Hence, the present paper aims to review the utility of HRV in neonatology and the instruments available to assess it, showing how HRV could be an innovative tool in the years to come. When continuously monitored, HRV could help assess the baby's overall wellbeing and neurological development to detect stress-/pain-related behaviors or pathological conditions, such as respiratory distress syndrome and hyperbilirubinemia, to address when to perform procedures to reduce the baby's stress/pain and interventions, such as therapeutic hypothermia, and to avoid severe complications, such as sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, thus reducing mortality. Based on literature and previous experiences, the first step to efficiently introduce HRV in the NICUs could consist in a monitoring system that uses photoplethysmography, which is low-cost and non-invasive, and displays one or a few metrics with good clinical utility. However, to fully harness HRV clinical potential and to greatly improve neonatal care, the monitoring systems will have to rely on modern bioinformatics (machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms), which could easily integrate infant's HRV metrics, vital signs, and especially past history, thus elaborating models capable to efficiently monitor and predict the infant's clinical conditions. For this reason, hospitals and institutions will have to establish tight collaborations between the obstetric, neonatal, and pediatric departments: this way, healthcare would truly improve in every stage of the perinatal period (from conception to the first years of life), since information about patients' health would flow freely among different professionals, and high-quality research could be performed integrating the data recorded in those departments.","Chiera, Cerritelli, Casini, Barsotti, Boschiero, Cavigioli, Corti, Manzotti","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2020.561186","20201022","HRV; NICU; autonomic nervous system; neonatology; newborns; photoplethysmography; preterm infants; vagus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16001,""
"Identification of Patients with Nontraumatic Intracranial Hemorrhage Using Administrative Claims Data","Nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a neurological emergency of research interest; however, unlike ischemic stroke, has not been well studied in large datasets due to the lack of an established administrative claims-based definition. We aimed to evaluate both explicit diagnosis codes and machine learning methods to create a claims-based definition for this clinical phenotype. We examined all patients admitted to our tertiary medical center with a primary or secondary International Classification of Disease version 9 (ICD-9) or 10 (ICD-10) code for ICH in claims from any portion of the hospitalization in 2014-2015. As a gold standard, we defined the nontraumatic ICH phenotype based on manual chart review. We tested explicit definitions based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 that had been previously published in the literature as well as four machine learning classifiers including support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression with LASSO, random forest and xgboost. We report five standard measures of model performance for each approach. A total of 1830 patients with 2145 unique ICD-10 codes were included in the initial dataset, of which 437 (24%) were true positive based on manual review. The explicit ICD-10 definition performed best (SensitivityÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.89 (95% CI 0.85-0.92), SpecificityÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.83 (0.81-0.85), F-scoreÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.73 (0.69-0.77)) and improves on an explicit ICD-9 definition (SensitivityÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.87 (0.83-0.90), SpecificityÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.77 (0.74-0.79), F-scoreÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.67 (0.63-0.71). Among machine learning classifiers, SVM performed best (SensitivityÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.78 (0.75-0.82), SpecificityÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.84 (0.81-0.87), AUCÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.89 (0.87-0.92), F-scoreÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.66 (0.62-0.69)). An explicit ICD-10 definition can be used to accurately identify patients with a nontraumatic ICH phenotype with substantially better performance than ICD-9. An explicit ICD-10 based definition is easier to implement and quantitatively not appreciably improved with the additional application of machine learning classifiers. Future research utilizing large datasets should utilize this definition to address important research gaps.","Sangal, Fodeh, Taylor, Rothenberg, Finn, Sheth, Matouk, Ulrich, Parwani, Sather, Venkatesh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105306","20201029","Health services research; Intracranial hemorrhage; Quality; Stroke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16002,""
"Graduate Student Literature Review: Evaluating the appropriate use of wearable accelerometers in research to monitor lying behaviors of dairy cows","Until recently, animal behavior has been studied through close and extensive observation of individual animals and has relied on subjective assessments. Wearable technologies that allow the automation of dairy cow behavior recording currently dominate the precision dairy technology market. Wearable accelerometers provide new opportunities in animal ethology using quantitative measures of dairy cow behavior. Recent research developments indicate that quantitative measures of behavior may provide new objective on-farm measures to assist producers in predicting, diagnosing, and managing disease or injury on farms and allowing producers to monitor cow comfort and estrus behavior. These recent research developments and a large increase in the availability of wearable accelerometers have led to growing interest of both researchers and producers in this technology. This review aimed to summarize the studies that have validated lying behavior derived from accelerometers and to describe the factors that should be considered when using leg-attached accelerometers and neck-worn collars to describe lying behavior (e.g., lying time and lying bouts) in dairy cows for research purposes. Specifically, we describe accelerometer technology, including the instrument properties and methods for recording motion; the raw data output from accelerometers; and methods developed for the transformation of raw data into meaningful and interpretable information. We highlight differences in validation study outcomes for researchers to consider when developing their own experimental methodology for the use of accelerometers to record lying behaviors in dairy cows. Finally, we discuss several factors that may influence the data recorded by accelerometers and highlight gaps in the literature. We conclude that researchers using accelerometers to record lying behaviors in dairy cattle should (1) select an accelerometer device that, based on device attachment and sampling rate, is appropriate to record the behavior of interest; (2) account for cow-, farm-, and management-related factors that could affect the lying behaviors recorded; (3) determine the appropriate editing criteria for the accurate interpretation of their data; (4) support their chosen method of recording, editing, and interpreting the data by referencing an appropriately designed and accurate validation study published in the literature; and (5) report, in detail, their methodology to ensure others can decipher how the data were captured and understand potential limitations of their methodology. We recommend that standardized protocols be developed for collecting, analyzing, and reporting lying behavior data recorded using wearable accelerometers for dairy cattle.","Hendriks, Phyn, Huzzey, Mueller, Turner, Donaghy, Roche","https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-17887","20201018","automated; precision; technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16003,""

"Top consumer uses of bestselling, single-ingredient vitamin and mineral supplements","Vitamin and mineral supplements are widely used for self-care of a variety of medical conditions, but little is known about the specific conditions for which they are used. This study mined consumer product reviews to determine specific ways vitamin and mineral supplements are being used therapeutically. A cross-sectional analysis of user reviews for top-selling, single-ingredient vitamin and mineral products from a popular online retailer was performed to identify the most frequently appearing words associated with medical conditions. Results of individual analyses were compared to achieve consensus on the top, relevant keywords for each supplement. The full text of the reviews was searched for these keywords to distinguish whether they referred to therapeutic uses or adverse effects. A total of 14 vitamin and 11 mineral supplements were analyzed. The number of user reviews for the analyzed products varied from 41 for manganese to over 5000 for biotin and vitamin D (medianÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°547 reviews per product). Cohen's kappa test for investigator-selected keywords related to medical conditions was generally greater than 0.6, indicating good interrater reliability. From these lists, the top consumer self-care uses were identified for 24 supplements. Commonly reported adverse effects were also noted for several products. This study used data mining to identify the top ways consumers use an array of bestselling, single-ingredient vitamin and mineral supplements.

"Clinical Decision Support Systems for Pressure Ulcer Management: Systematic Review","The clinical decision-making process in pressure ulcer management is complex, and its quality depends on both the nurse's experience and the availability of scientific knowledge. This process should follow evidence-based practices incorporating health information technologies to assist health care professionals, such as the use of clinical decision support systems. These systems, in addition to increasing the quality of care provided, can reduce errors and costs in health care. However, the widespread use of clinical decision support systems still has limited evidence, indicating the need to identify and evaluate its effects on nursing clinical practice. The goal of the review was to identify the effects of nurses using clinical decision support systems on clinical decision making for pressure ulcer management. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) recommendations. The search was conducted in April 2019 on 5 electronic databases: MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane, and CINAHL, without publication date or study design restrictions. Articles that addressed the use of computerized clinical decision support systems in pressure ulcer care applied in clinical practice were included. The reference lists of eligible articles were searched manually. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. The search strategy resulted in 998 articles, 16 of which were included. The year of publication ranged from 1995 to 2017, with 45% of studies conducted in the United States. Most addressed the use of clinical decision support systems by nurses in pressure ulcers prevention in inpatient units. All studies described knowledge-based systems that assessed the effects on clinical decision making, clinical effects secondary to clinical decision support system use, or factors that influenced the use or intention to use clinical decision support systems by health professionals and the success of their implementation in nursing practice. The evidence in the available literature about the effects of clinical decision support systems (used by nurses) on decision making for pressure ulcer prevention and treatment is still insufficient. No significant effects were found on nurses' knowledge following the integration of clinical decision support systems into the workflow, with assessments made for a brief period of up to 6 months. Clinical effects, such as outcomes in the incidence and prevalence of pressure ulcers, remain limited in the studies, and most found clinically but nonstatistically significant results in decreasing pressure ulcers. It is necessary to carry out studies that prioritize better adoption and interaction of nurses with clinical decision support systems, as well as studies with a representative sample of health care professionals, randomized study designs, and application of assessment instruments appropriate to the professional and institutional profile. In addition, long-term follow-up is necessary to assess the effects of clinical decision support systems that can demonstrate a more real, measurable, and significant effect on clinical decision making.

"An Evidence-Based Guide for Medical Students: How to Optimize the Use of Expanded-Retrieval Platforms","Recommendations have been made for improving medical education based on the available evidence regarding learning. Traditional learning methods in medical education (e.g. reading from textbooks) doÃ‚Â not ensure long-term retention. However, expanded-retrieval studying methods have been shown to improve studying efficiency. Using evidence-based practices to optimize an expanded-retrieval platform has the potential to greatly benefit knowledge acquisition and retention for medical students. This literature review was conducted to identify the best practices of expanded-retrieval platforms. Themes within learning that promote knowledge gain and retention include presentation of related categorical information, schema formation, dual-coding, concrete examples, elaboration, changes in text appearance, and interleaving. Presentation of related categorical material together may mitigate retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF). Spaced retrieval helps to reinforce schema formation by solidifying the framework the individual students form when learning the material. Dual-coding improves learning by creating more neural pathways. Multiple concrete examples can be compared by students to see their respective differences, highlighting the true underlying principle. Variation in text appearance is most useful during the initial, short-term inter-study intervals. Interleaving is a theme where different topics are combined in the same study session and is unpopular with students but shown to be successful. Students' subjective competency ratings of new material are largely inaccurate. More in-depth processing and learning methods that give off a sense of lower competency are actually associated with improved long-term retention. Expanded-retrieval platforms should utilize these evidence-based components of learning to increase knowledge gain and retention within all fields of medical education.","Pumilia, Lessans, Harris","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10372","20201020","active learning; anki; evidence-based learning; expanded-retrieval; knowledge acquisition; medical education; optimization; retention; retrieval; spaced repetition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16008,""
"Forty years of emergency medicine research: Uncovering research themes and trends through topic modeling","Topic identification can facilitate knowledge curation, discover thematic relationships, trends, and predict future direction. We aimed to determine through an unsupervised, machine learning approach to topic modeling the most common research themes in emergency medicine over the last 40Ã‚Â years and summarize their trends and characteristics. We retrieved the complete reference entries including article abstracts from Ovid for all original research articles from 1980 to 2019 within emergency medicine for six widely-cited journals. Abstracts were processed through a natural language pipeline and analyzed by a latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling algorithm for unsupervised topic discovery. Topics were further examined through trend analysis, word associations, co-occurrence metrics, and two-dimensional embeddings. We retrieved 47,158 articles during the defined time period that were filtered to 20,528 articles for further analysis. Forty topics covering methodologic and clinical areas were discovered. These topics separated into distinct clusters when embedded in two-dimensional space and exhibited consistent patterns of interaction. We observed the greatest increase in popularity in research themes involving risk factors (0.4% to 5.2%), health utilization (1.2% to 5.0%), and ultrasound (0.7% to 3.3%), and a relative decline in research involving basic science (8.9% to 1.1%), cardiac arrest (6.5% to 2.2%), and vitals (6.3% to 1.3%) over the past 40Ã‚Â years. Our data show only very modest growth in mental health and substance abuse research (1.0% to 1.6%), despite ongoing crises.

"An evaluation of DistillerSR's machine learning-based prioritization tool for title/abstract screening - impact on reviewer-relevant outcomes","Systematic reviews often require substantial resources, partially due to the large number of records identified during searching. Although artificial intelligence may not be ready to fully replace human reviewers, it may accelerate and reduce the screening burden. Using DistillerSR (May 2020 release), we evaluated the performance of the prioritization simulation tool to determine the reduction in screening burden and time savings. Using a true recall @ 95%, response sets from 10 completed systematic reviews were used to evaluate: (i) the reduction of screening burden; (ii) the accuracy of the prioritization algorithm; and (iii) the hours saved when a modified screening approach was implemented. To account for variation in the simulations, and to introduce randomness (through shuffling the references), 10 simulations were run for each review. Means, standard deviations, medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) are presented. Among the 10 systematic reviews, using true recall @ 95% there was a median reduction in screening burden of 47.1% (IQR: 37.5 to 58.0%). A median of 41.2% (IQR: 33.4 to 46.9%) of the excluded records needed to be screened to achieve true recall @ 95%. The median title/abstract screening hours saved using a modified screening approach at a true recall @ 95% was 29.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°h (IQR: 28.1 to 74.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°h). This was increased to a median of 36Ã¢â‚¬â€°h (IQR: 32.2 to 79.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°h) when considering the time saved not retrieving and screening full texts of the remaining 5% of records not yet identified as included at title/abstract. Among the 100 simulations (10 simulations per review), none of these 5% of records were a final included study in the systematic review. The reduction in screening burden to achieve true recall @ 95% compared to @ 100% resulted in a reduced screening burden median of 40.6% (IQR: 38.3 to 54.2%). The prioritization tool in DistillerSR can reduce screening burden. A modified or stop screening approach once a true recall @ 95% is achieved appears to be a valid method for rapid reviews, and perhaps systematic reviews. This needs to be further evaluated in prospective reviews using the estimated recall.","Hamel, Kelly, Thavorn, Rice, Wells, Hutton","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01129-1","20201022","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Efficiency; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Prioritization; Rapid reviews; Systematic reviews; Time savings; True recall","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16010,""

The proposed automation framework consisted of two natural language processing (NLP) based tools for unstructured text data for medications and reasons for medication use. We first checked spelling using a spell-check program trained on publicly available knowledge sources and then applied NLP techniques. We mapped medication names into generic names using vocabulary from publicly available knowledge sources. We used WHO's Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system to map generic medication names to medication classes. We processed the reasons for medication with the Lancaster stemmer method and then grouped and mapped to disease classes based on organ systems. Finally, we demonstrated this automation framework on two data sources for Mylagic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS): tertiary-based (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°378) and population-based (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°664) samples. A total of 8681 raw medication records were used for this demonstration. The 1266 distinct medication names (omitting supplements) were condensed to 89 ATC classification system categories. The 1432 distinct raw reasons for medication use were condensed to 65 categories via NLP. Compared to completion of the entire process manually, our automation process reduced the number of the terms requiring manual labor for mapping by 84.4% for medications and 59.4% for reasons for medication use. Additionally, this process improved the precision of the mapped results. Our automation framework demonstrates the usefulness of NLP strategies even when there is no established mapping database. For a less established database (e.g., reasons for medication use), the method is easily modifiable as new knowledge sources for mapping are introduced. The capability to condense large features into interpretable ones will be valuable for subsequent analytical studies involving techniques such as machine learning and data mining.","Chen, Ho, Lin","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01131-7","20201022","Automation; Co-morbidity; Data extraction; Medication; Mylagic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS); Natural language processing; Population; Tertiary; Unstructured data","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16011,""
"Thermal Imaging Techniques for Breast Screening - A Survey","Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women preceded by cervix cancer. It has been reported that at the early stage of detection there is 85% chance of getting cured, whereas only 10% chance at later stage diagnosis. The current screening modalities are expensive, they have intricate imaging measures and they are unhealthy due to radiation exposure. Therefore, a screening tool that is non-invasive, has no connection with the body, free from radiation, such as Medical Thermography is necessary. It is reported that the sensitivity and specificity of medical thermography are high largely in dense breast tissues. The clinical interpretation primarily depends on the asymmetrical analysis of these thermograms subjectively. The appearance of an asymmetric thermal image may indicate the pathological conditions. For earlier detection of breast cancer, it is essential to identify the advanced methods in image processing techniques which enhance the significance of diagnostics. In that analysis, the required breast region is unglued from the background image. The segmented image is separated into symmetrical left and right breast tissues. The statistical and histogram features extracted from both regions are used to identify the abnormal thermograms using machine learning algorithms. From literature, it is reported that the thermal images are inherently low contrast images and have low single to noise ratio. Moreover, they are amorphous in nature and no clear edges are seen. The difficulty lies in the detection of lower breast boundaries and inframammary folds. So, in general, the first attempt is made in improving the signal to noise ratio and contrast of the image which helps to extract the true regions of breast tissues. Then, asymmetry analysis of the normal and abnormal breast tissues is performed using different techniques. This work demonstrates the review of a few image processing methods or the development which are elaborated in the detection of breast cancer from thermal images.","S","https://doi.org/10.2174/1573405615666191115145038","20201028","Breast thermography; breast cancer; feature extraction; medical images; segmentation; thermal images","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16012,""
"Utilization of smartphone and tablet camera photographs to predict healing of diabetes-related foot ulcers","The objective of this study was to build a machine learning model that can predict healing of diabetes-related foot ulcers, using both clinical attributes extracted from electronic health records (EHR) and image features extracted from photographs. The clinical information and photographs were collected at an academic podiatry wound clinic over a three-year period. Both hand-crafted color and texture features and deep learning-based features from the global average pooling layer of ResNet-50 were extracted from the wound photographs. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were then trained for prediction. For prediction of eventual wound healing, the models built with hand-crafted imaging features alone outperformed models built with clinical or deep-learning features alone. Models trained with all features performed comparatively against models trained with hand-crafted imaging features. Utilization of smartphone and tablet photographs taken outside of research settings hold promise for predicting prognosis of diabetes-related foot ulcers.","Kim, Gryak, Mishra, Cui, Soroushmehr, Najarian, Wrobel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.104042","20201102","Clinical prediction model; Diabetic foot ulcers; Electronic health records; Image processing; Machine learning; Photographs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16013,""
"Using the contextual language model BERT for multi-criteria classification of scientific articles","Finding specific scientific articles in a large collection is an important natural language processing challenge in the biomedical domain. Systematic reviews and interactive article search are the type of downstream applications that benefit from addressing this problem. The task often involves screening articles for a combination of selection criteria. While machine learning was previously used for this purpose, it is not known if different criteria should be modeled together or separately in an ensemble model. The performance impact of the modern contextual language models on the task is also not known. We framed the problem as text classification and conducted experiments to compare ensemble architectures, where the selection criteria were mapped to the components of the ensemble. We proposed a novel cascade ensemble analogous to the step-wise screening process employed in developing the gold standard. We compared performance of the ensembles with a single integrated model, which we refer to as the individual task learner (ITL). We used SciBERT, a variant of BERT pre-trained on scientific articles, and conducted experiments using a manually annotated dataset of ~49Ã‚Â K MEDLINE abstracts, known as Clinical Hedges. The cascade ensemble had significantly higher precision (0.663 vs. 0.388 vs. 0.478 vs. 0.320) and F measure (0.753 vs. 0.553 vs. 0.628 vs. 0.477) than ITL and ensembles using Boolean logic and a feed-forward network. However, ITL had significantly higher recall than the other classifiers (0.965 vs. 0.872 vs. 0.917 vs. 0.944). In fixed high recall studies, ITL achieved 0.509 precision @ 0.970 recall and 0.381 precision @ 0.985 recall on a subset that was studied earlier, and 0.295 precision @ 0.985 recall on the full dataset, all of which were improvements over the previous studies. Pre-trained neural contextual language models (e.g. SciBERT) performed well for screening scientific articles. Performance at high fixed recall makes the single integrated model (ITL) more suitable among the architectures considered here, for systematic reviews. However, high F measure of the cascade ensemble makes it a better approach for interactive search applications. The effectiveness of the cascade ensemble architecture suggests broader applicability beyond this task and the dataset, and the approach is analogous to query optimization in Information Retrieval and query optimization in databases.","Ambalavanan, Devarakonda","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103578","20201102","BERT; Biomedical natural language processing; Machine learning; Neural networks; SciBERT; Screening scientific articles; Text classification","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16014,""
"Graphical Presentations of Clinical Data in a Learning Electronic Medical Record","Complex electronic medical records (EMRs) presenting large amounts of data create risks of cognitive overload. We are designing a Learning EMR (LEMR) system that utilizes models of intensive care unit (ICU) physicians' data access patterns to identify and then highlight the most relevant data for each patient. We used insights from literature and feedback from potential users to inform the design of an EMR display capable of highlighting relevant information. We used a review of relevant literature to guide the design of preliminary paper prototypes of the LEMR user interface. We observed five ICU physicians using their current EMR systems in preparation for morning rounds. Participants were interviewed and asked to explain their interactions and challenges with the EMR systems. Findings informed the revision of our prototypes. Finally, we conducted a focus group with five ICU physicians to elicit feedback on our designs and to generate ideas for our final prototypes using participatory design methods. Participating physicians expressed support for the LEMR system. Identified design requirements included the display of data essential for every patient together with diagnosis-specific data and new or significantly changed information. Respondents expressed preferences for fishbones to organize labs, mouseovers to access additional details, and unobtrusive alerts minimizing color-coding. To address the concern about possible physician overreliance on highlighting, participants suggested that non-highlighted data should remain accessible. Study findings led to revised prototypes, which will inform the development of a functional user interface. In the feedback we received, physicians supported pursuing the concept of a LEMR system. By introducing novel ways to support physicians' cognitive abilities, such a system has the potential to enhance physician EMR use and lead to better patient outcomes. Future plans include laboratory studies of both the utility of the proposed designs on decision-making, and the possible impact of any automation bias.","Calzoni, Clermont, Cooper, Visweswaran, Hochheiser","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1709707","20201027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16015,""
"Designing an openEHR-Based Pipeline for Extracting and Standardizing Unstructured Clinical Data Using Natural Language Processing","Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Merging disparate and heterogeneous datasets from clinical routine in a standardized and semantically enriched format to enable a multiple use of data also means incorporating unstructured data such as medical free texts. Although the extraction of structured data from texts, known as natural language processing (NLP), has been researched at least for the English language extensively, it is not enough to get a structured output in any format. NLP techniques need to be used together with clinical information standards such as openEHR to be able to reuse and exchange still unstructured data sensibly. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’The aim of the study is to automatically extract crucial information from medical free texts and to transform this unstructured clinical data into a standardized and structured representation by designing and implementing an exemplary pipeline for the processing of pediatric medical histories. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’We constructed a pipeline that allows reusing medical free texts such as pediatric medical histories in a structured and standardized way by (1) selecting and modeling appropriate openEHR archetypes as standard clinical information models, (2) defining a German dictionary with crucial text markers serving as expert knowledge base for a NLP pipeline, and (3) creating mapping rules between the NLP output and the archetypes. The approach was evaluated in a first pilot study by using 50 manually annotated medical histories from the pediatric intensive care unit of the Hannover Medical School. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’We successfully reused 24 existing international archetypes to represent the most crucial elements of unstructured pediatric medical histories in a standardized form. The self-developed NLP pipeline was constructed by defining 3.055 text marker entries, 132 text events, 66 regular expressions, and a text corpus consisting of 776 entries for automatic correction of spelling mistakes. A total of 123 mapping rules were implemented to transform the extracted snippets to an openEHR-based representation to be able to store them together with other structured data in an existing openEHR-based data repository. In the first evaluation, the NLP pipeline yielded 97% precision and 94% recall. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’The use of NLP and openEHR archetypes was demonstrated as a viable approach for extracting and representing important information from pediatric medical histories in a structured and semantically enriched format. We designed a promising approach with potential to be generalized, and implemented a prototype that is extensible and reusable for other use cases concerning German medical free texts. In a long term, this will harness unstructured clinical data for further research purposes such as the design of clinical decision support systems. Together with structured data already integrated in openEHR-based representations, we aim at developing an interoperable openEHR-based application that is capable of automatically assessing a patient's risk status based on the patient's medical history at time of admission.","Wulff, Mast, Hassler, Montag, Marschollek, Jack","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1716403","20201015","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16016,""
"Artificial Intelligence and Its Role in Identifying Esophageal Neoplasia","Randomized trials have demonstrated that ablation of dysplastic Barrett's esophagus can reduce the risk of progression to cancer. Endoscopic resection for early stage esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma can significantly reduce postoperative morbidity compared to esophagectomy. Unfortunately, current endoscopic surveillance technologies (e.g., high-definition white light, electronic, and dye-based chromoendoscopy) lack sensitivity at identifying subtle areas of dysplasia and cancer. Random biopsies sample only approximately 5% of the esophageal mucosa at risk, and there is poor agreement among pathologists in identifying low-grade dysplasia. Machine-based deep learning medical image and video assessment technologies have progressed significantly in recent years, enabled in large part by advances in computer processing capabilities. In deep learning, sequential layers allow models to transform input data (e.g., pixels for imaging data) into a composite representation that allows for classification and feature identification. Several publications have attempted to use this technology to help identify dysplasia and early esophageal cancer. The aims of this reviews are as follows: (a) discussing limitations in our current strategies to identify esophageal dysplasia and cancer, (b) explaining the concepts behind deep learning and convolutional neural networks using language appropriate for clinicians without an engineering background, (c) systematically reviewing the literature for studies that have used deep learning to identify esophageal neoplasia, and (d) based on the systemic review, outlining strategies on further work necessary before these technologies are ready for &quot;prime-time,&quot; i.e., use in routine clinical care.","Syed, Doshi, Guleria, Syed, Shah","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-020-06643-2","20201015","Artificial intelligence; BarrettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s esophagus; Computer assisted diagnosis; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Esophageal cancer","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16017,""
"Effect of Integrating Machine Learning Mortality Estimates With Behavioral Nudges to Clinicians on Serious Illness Conversations Among Patients With Cancer: A Stepped-Wedge Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial","Serious illness conversations (SICs) are structured conversations between clinicians and patients about prognosis, treatment goals, and end-of-life preferences. Interventions that increase the rate of SICs between oncology clinicians and patients may improve goal-concordant care and patient outcomes. To determine the effect of a clinician-directed intervention integrating machine learning mortality predictions with behavioral nudges on motivating clinician-patient SICs. This stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted across 20 weeks (from June 17 to November 1, 2019) at 9 medical oncology clinics (8 subspecialty oncology and 1 general oncology clinics) within a large academic health system in Pennsylvania. Clinicians at the 2 smallest subspecialty clinics were grouped together, resulting in 8 clinic groups randomly assigned to the 4 intervention wedge periods. Included participants in the intention-to-treat analyses were 78 oncology clinicians who received SIC training and their patients (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14Ã¢â‚¬Â¯607) who had an outpatient oncology encounter during the study period. (1) Weekly emails to oncology clinicians with SIC performance feedback and peer comparisons; (2) a list of up to 6 high-risk patients (Ã¢â€°Â¥10% predicted risk of 180-day mortality) scheduled for the next week, estimated using a validated machine learning algorithm; and (3) opt-out text message prompts to clinicians on the patient's appointment day to consider an SIC. Clinicians in the control group received usual care consisting of weekly emails with cumulative SIC performance. Percentage of patient encounters with an SIC in the intervention group vs the usual care (control) group. The sample consisted of 78 clinicians and 14Ã¢â‚¬Â¯607 patients. The mean (SD) age of patients was 61.9 (14.2) years, 53.7% were female, and 70.4% were White. For all encounters, SICs were conducted among 1.3% in the control group and 4.6% in the intervention group, a significant difference (adjusted difference in percentage points, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.3-4.5; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Among 4124 high-risk patient encounters, SICs were conducted among 3.6% in the control group and 15.2% in the intervention group, a significant difference (adjusted difference in percentage points, 11.6; 95% CI, 8.2-12.5; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). In this stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial, an intervention that delivered machine learning mortality predictions with behavioral nudges to oncology clinicians significantly increased the rate of SICs among all patients and among patients with high mortality risk who were targeted by the intervention. Behavioral nudges combined with machine learning mortality predictions can positively influence clinician behavior and may be applied more broadly to improve care near the end of life.

"Modelling COVID 19 in the Basque Country from introduction to control measure response","In March 2020, a multidisciplinary task force (so-called Basque Modelling Task Force, BMTF) was created to assist the Basque health managers and Government during the COVID-19 responses. BMTF is a modelling team, working on different approaches, including stochastic processes, statistical methods and artificial intelligence. Here we describe the efforts and challenges to develop a flexible modeling framework able to describe the dynamics observed for the tested positive cases, including the modelling development steps. The results obtained by a new stochastic SHARUCD model framework are presented. Our models differentiate mild and asymptomatic from severe infections prone to be hospitalized and were able to predict the course of the epidemic, providing important projections on the national health system's necessities during the increased population demand on hospital admissions. Short and longer-term predictions were tested with good results adjusted to the available epidemiological data. We have shown that the partial lockdown measures were effective and enough to slow down disease transmission in the Basque Country. The growth rate [Formula: see text] was calculated from the model and from the data and the implications for the reproduction ratio r are shown. The analysis of the growth rates from the data led to improved model versions describing after the exponential phase also the new information obtained during the phase of response to the control measures.

No financial ties were disclosed in any of the comments that were not from industry submitters. The vast majority of submitted comments (86%) did not cite any scientific literature, just 4% cited a systematic review or meta-analysis and no comments indicated that a systematic process was used to identify relevant literature. Financial ties to industry were common and undisclosed, and scientific evidence, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, were rarely cited.

"Towards Preparing a Knowledgebase to Explore Potential Drugs and Biomedical Entities Related to COVID-19","Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is taking a huge toll on public health. Along with the non-therapeutic preventive measurements, scientific efforts are currently focused, mainly, on the development of vaccines and pharmacological treatment with existing drugs. Summarizing evidences from scientific literatures on the discovery of treatment plan of COVID-19 under a platform would help the scientific community to explore the opportunities in a systematic fashion. The aim of this study is to explore the potential drugs and biomedical entities related to coronavirus related diseases, including COVID-19, that are mentioned on scientific literature through an automated computational approach. We mined the information from publicly available scientific literature and related public resources. Six topic-specific dictionaries, including human genes, human miRNAs, diseases, Protein Databank, drugs, and drug side effects, were integrated to mine all scientific evidence related to COVID-19. We employed an automated literature mining and labeling system through a novel approach to measure the effectiveness of drugs against diseases based on natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and deep learning. We also applied the concept of cosine similarity to confidently infer the associations between diseases and genes. Based on the literature mining, we identified 1805 diseases, 2454 drugs, 1910 genes that are related to coronavirus related diseases including COVID-19. Integrating the extracted information, we developed the first knowledgebase platform dedicated to COVID-19, which highlights potential list of drugs and related biomedical entities. For COVID-19, we highlighted multiple case studies on existing drugs along with a confidence score for their applicability in the treatment plan. Based on our computational method, we found Remdesivir, Statins, Dexamethasone, and Ivermectin could be considered as potential effective drugs to improve clinical status and lower mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We also found that Hydroxychloroquine could not be considered as an effective drug for COVID-19. The resulting knowledgebase is made available as an open source tool, named COVID-19Base, for the scientific community: http://covid-19base.hbku.edu.qa/, http://covid-19base.buet.ac.bd/. Proper investigation of the mined biomedical entities along with the identified interactions among those would help the research community to discover possible ways for the therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.","Khan, Khondaker, Hoque, Al-Absi, Rahman, Guler, Alam, Rahman","https://doi.org/10.2196/21648","20201015","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16021,""
"Prevalence and associated factors of urinary incontinence in women living in China: a literature review","This review of studies on urinary incontinence (UI) was focused primarily on UI prevalence rates and associated factors across the adult lifecourse of Chinese women. UI is a urologic symptom that can have a significant impact on women's physical and mental health and quality of life. In addition, women with UI may experience socioeconomic burdens due to UI's effect on their ability to work and function in society. Although researchers from many countries have reported prevalence rates and associated factors for UI, little is known about the prevalence of UI in China's large female population. Language may act as a barrier to the inclusion of published studies in English-language journals. To overcome this barrier and to add to the global knowledge base about UI in women, the authors reviewed and discussed findings from epidemiological studies published in China and in Chinese language. The authors retrieved research studies from the Wanfang database using the following search terms: &quot;Subject: (Female)Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°Subject: (Urinary incontinence)Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°Subject: (Prevalence)Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°Date: 2013 to 2019&quot;. Searches employed the China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals and China Biology Medicine Database. The authors also used PubMed to search English-language studies published in Chinese journals on UI in Chinese women. This literature review includes 48 articles published between January 2013 and December 2019. The overall UI prevalence rates reported in adult Chinese women ranged from 8.7 to 69.8%, representing 43-349 million women, respectively. For women aged 17-40Ã‚Â years, 41-59Ã‚Â years, and 60Ã‚Â years and older, prevalence rates ranged from 2.6-30.0, 8.7-47.7, to 16.9-61.6%, respectively. Significant associated factors for overall UI included age, body mass index, constipation, parity, and menopause. Despite the 17-40 age range being peak reproductive years, the literature revealed little focus on UI prevalence rates. For women aged 41-59Ã‚Â years, the main associated factors included those related to pregnancy and gynecologic diseases. For women 60Ã‚Â years and older, chronic diseases represented most of the associated factors. About 43-349 million Chinese women may experience UI. Many of the identified associated factors could be mitigated to reduce UI incidence and prevalence rates. Little is known about the prevalence rates and associated factors for UI among young (aged 17-40) Chinese women. Future research should investigate UI in young women to improve bladder health across their lifecourse.","Xue, Palmer, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12894-020-00735-x","20201022","Bladder; China; Prevalence; Urinary incontinence; Women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16022,""
"Lotus petal flap and vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap in vulvoperineal reconstruction: a systematic review of differences in complications","Vulvoperineal defects resulting from surgical treatment of (pre)malignancies may result in reconstructive challenges. The vertical rectus abdominis muscle flap and, more recently, the fasciocutaneous lotus petal flap are often used for reconstruction in this area. The goal of this review is to compare the postoperative complications of application of these flaps. <i>Methods:</i> A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases was performed until 6 June 2020. Search terms included the lotus petal flap, vertical rectus abdominis muscle flap and the vulvoperineal area. Articles were independently screened by two researchers according to the PRISMA-guidelines. <i>Results:</i> A total of 1074 citations were retrieved and reviewed, of which 55 were included for full text analysis. Following lotus petal flap reconstructions, the complication rate varied from 0.0% to 69.9%, with more complications concerning the recipient site compared with the donor site complications (26.0% versus 4.5%). Following vertical rectus abdominis muscle flap reconstructions the complication rate varied between 0.0% and 85.7% with almost twice the number of recipient site complications compared to donor site complications (37.1% versus 17.8%). <i>Conclusions:</i> Overall, the lotus petal flap has lower complication rates at both the donor and the recipient site compared with the vertical rectus abdominis muscle flap. When both options seem viable, the lotus petal flap procedure may be preferred on the basis of the reported lower complication rates. <b>Abbreviations:</b> APE: abdominoperineal excision; ELAPE: extra levator abdominoperineal excision; LP flap: lotus petal flap; NIH: National Institute of Health; NR: not reported; RCT: randomized controlled trial; VRAM flap: vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap.","Hellinga, Rots, Werker, Stenekes","https://doi.org/10.1080/2000656X.2020.1828902","20201015","Lotus petal flap; complications; systematic review; vertical rectus abdominis muscle flap; vulvoperineal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16023,""

Not enough research practice has been conducted on the influence of interventions on HL, and thus, it is difficult to implement evidence-based interventions. <i>Conclusions</i>: Interventions aiming to benefit and improve HL should consider the complex web of intersectional determinants that end up shaping the opportunities of women to make optimal decisions regarding their health and care, and which may require attention to much more than clinical or service delivery factors.","Vila-Candel, MartÃƒÂ­nez-Arnau, de la CÃƒÂ¡mara-de Las Heras, Castro-SÃƒÂ¡nchez, PÃƒÂ©rez-Ros","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17207405","20201101","health literacy; intervention; numeracy; pregnant women; reading ability; reading skill","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16024,""
"A preliminary investigation of radiomics differences between ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms","Prediction of intracranial aneurysm rupture is important in the management of unruptured aneurysms. The application of radiomics in predicting aneurysm rupture remained largely unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the radiomics differences between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms and explore its potential use in predicting aneurysm rupture. One hundred twenty-two aneurysms were included in the study (93 unruptured). Morphological and radiomics features were extracted for each case. Statistical analysis was performed to identify significant features which were incorporated into prediction models constructed with a machine learning algorithm. To investigate the usefulness of radiomics features, three models were constructed and compared. The baseline model A was constructed with morphological features, while model B was constructed with addition of radiomics shape features and model C with more radiomics features. Multivariate analysis was performed for the ten most important variables in model C to identify independent risk factors. A simplified model based on independent risk factors was constructed for clinical use. Five morphological features and 89 radiomics features were significantly associated with rupture. Model A, model B, and model C achieved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.767, 0.807, and 0.879, respectively. Model C was significantly better than model A and model B (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Multivariate analysis identified two radiomics features which were used to construct the simplified model showing an AUROC of 0.876. Radiomics signatures were different between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. The use of radiomics features, especially texture features, may significantly improve rupture prediction performance. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Significant radiomics differences exist between ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Radiomics shape features can significantly improve rupture prediction performance over conventional morphology-based prediction model. The inclusion of histogram and texture radiomics features can further improve the performance. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ A simplified model with two variables achieved a similar level of performance as the more complex ones. Our prediction model can serve as a promising tool for the risk management of intracranial aneurysms.","Ou, Chong, Duan, Zhang, Morgan, Qian","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07325-3","20201014","Intracranial aneurysm; Machine learning; Radiomics; Rupture; Stroke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16025,""
"A Medical Translation Assistant for Non-English-Speaking Caregivers of Children With Special Health Care Needs: Proposal for a Scalable and Interoperable Mobile App","Communication and comprehension of medical information are known barriers in health communication and equity, especially for non-English-speaking caregivers of children with special health care needs. The objective of this proposal was to develop an interoperable and scalable medical translation app for non-English-speaking caregivers to facilitate the conversation between provider and caregiver/patient. We employed user-centered and participatory design methods to understand the problems and develop a solution by engaging the stakeholder team (including caregivers, physicians, researchers, clinical informaticists, nurses, developers, nutritionists, pharmacists, and interpreters) and non-English-speaking caregiver participants. Considering the lack of interpreter service accessibility and advancement in translation technology, our team will develop and test an integrated, multimodal (voice-interactive and text-based) patient portal communication and translation app to enable non-English-speaking caregivers to communicate with providers using their preferred languages. For this initial prototype, we will focus on the Spanish language and Spanish-speaking families to test technical feasibility and evaluate usability. Our proposal brings a unique perspective to medical translation and communication between caregiver and provider by (1) enabling voice entry and transcription in health care communications, (2) integrating with patient portals to facilitate caregiver and provider communications, and (3) adopting a translation verification model to improve accuracy of artificial intelligence-facilitated translations. Expected outcomes include improved health communications, literacy, and health equity. In addition, data points will be collected to improve autotranslation services in medical communications. We believe our proposed solution is affordable, interoperable, and scalable for health systems.","Sezgin, Noritz, Hoffman, Huang","https://doi.org/10.2196/21038","20201031","caregiver-provider communication; medical translation; mobile app; pediatrics; special health care needs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16026,""
"Use of Natural Language Processing Algorithms to Identify Common Data Elements in Operative Notes for Knee Arthroplasty","Natural language processing (NLP) methods have the capability to process clinical free text in electronic health records, decreasing the need for costly manual chart review, and improving data quality. We developed rule-based NLP algorithms to automatically extract surgery specific data elements from knee arthroplasty operative notes. Within a cohort of 20,000 knee arthroplasty operative notes from 2000 to 2017 at a large tertiary institution, we randomly selected independent pairs of training and test sets to develop and evaluate NLP algorithms to detect five major data elements. The size of the training and test datasets were similar and ranged between 420 to 1592 surgeries. Expert rules using keywords in operative notes were used to implement NLP algorithms capturing: (1) category of surgery (total knee arthroplasty, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, patellofemoral arthroplasty), (2) laterality of surgery, (3) constraint type, (4) presence of patellar resurfacing, and (5) implant model (catalog numbers). We used institutional registry data as our gold standard to evaluate the NLP algorithms. NLP algorithms to detect the category of surgery, laterality, constraint, and patellar resurfacing achieved 98.3%, 99.5%, 99.2%, and 99.4% accuracy on test datasets, respectively. The implant model algorithm achieved an F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of 99.9%. NLP algorithms are a promising alternative to costly manual chart review to automate the extraction of embedded information within knee arthroplasty operative notes. Further validation in other hospital settings will enhance widespread implementation and efficiency in data capture for research and clinical purposes.

"Classification of Biomedical Texts for Cardiovascular Diseases with Deep Neural Network Using a Weighted Feature Representation Method","This study aims to improve the performance of multiclass classification of biomedical texts for cardiovascular diseases by combining two different feature representation methods, i.e., bag-of-words (BoW) and word embeddings (WE). To hybridize the two feature representations, we investigated a set of possible statistical weighting schemes to combine with each element of WE vectors, which were term frequency (TF), inverse document frequency (IDF) and class probability (CP) methods. Thus, we built a multiclass classification model using a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) with deep neural networks for all investigated operations of feature vector combinations. We used MIMIC III and the PubMed dataset for the developing language model. To evaluate the performance of our weighted feature representation approaches, we conducted a set of experiments for examining multiclass classification performance with the deep neural network model and other state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) approaches. In all experiments, we used the OHSUMED-400 dataset, which includes PubMed abstracts related with specifically one class over 23 cardiovascular disease categories. Afterwards, we presented the results obtained from experiments and provided a comparison with related research in the literature. The results of the experiment showed that our BLSTM model with the weighting techniques outperformed the baseline and other machine learning approaches in terms of validation accuracy. Finally, our model outperformed the scores of related studies in the literature. This study shows that weighted feature representation improves the performance of the multiclass classification.","Ahmed, DilmaÃƒÂ§, Alpkocak","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8040392","20201014","BLSTM; bidirectional long short-term memory; biomedical text classification; cardiovascular diseases; deep neural network; feature representation; multiclass classification","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16028,""
"A regression framework to head-circumference delineation from US fetal images","Measuring head-circumference (HC) length from ultrasound (US) images is a crucial clinical task to assess fetus growth. To lower intra- and inter-operator variability in HC length measuring, several computer-assisted solutions have been proposed in the years. Recently, a large number of deep-learning approaches is addressing the problem of HC delineation through the segmentation of the whole fetal head via convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Since the task is a edge-delineation problem, we propose a different strategy based on regression CNNs. The proposed framework consists of a region-proposal CNN for head localization and centering, and a regression CNN for accurately delineate the HC. The first CNN is trained exploiting transfer learning, while we propose a training strategy for the regression CNN based on distance fields. The framework was tested on the HC18 Challenge dataset, which consists of 999 training and 335 testing images. A mean absolute difference of 1.90 (Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚ 1.76) mm and a Dice similarity coefficient of 97.75 (Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚ 1.32) % were achieved, overcoming approaches in the literature.

"White matter microstructural abnormalities in primary insomnia: A systematic review of diffusion tensor imaging studies","Primary insomnia (PI), the most common sleep disorder, is primarily characterized by difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep and deficits in daytime functioning. Study of white matter (WM) connections of the brain might provide valuable information regarding the underlying neural mechanism of PI. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides non-invasive access to the microstructural and network properties of brain WM, and thus, a great opportunity to quantitatively and sensitively study the human brain. The current literature of PI does not provide a consistent explanation of the etiology and pathology of the disorder; thus, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS for DTI studies that compared WM integrity or network organization between PI patients and healthy controls to integrate all existing literature as an insight for further studies, and, hopefully, effective prevention and management of the disorder. English peer-reviewed full-text publications that investigated the diffusion indices of PI patients or those with insomnia symptoms compared with a group of healthy controls were included. We included 11 studies and extracted the data for qualitative synthesis. Except for one study, all studies were rated as high-quality, based on quality assessment. In aggregation, a total of 541 patients with PI and 679 healthy controls were included in this study. Our review of DTI studies suggests that WM disruptions in PI are better characterized in the context of neural networks. Frontostriatal, frontothalamic, and corticocortiscal networks, as well as the limbic system, seem to be the main neural networks with microstructural and network alterations in patients with PI. To illustrate, different parts of corona radiate and internal capsule within the corticosubcortical networks and superior longitudinal fasciculus within the corticocortical networks showed altered microstructural properties in PI patients. In view of the fact that the findings from individual studies are heterogeneous, it is difficult to derive consistent findings from the results, and the divergence of the findings must not be disregarded. Thus, this study is a starting point for future studies, and its implications for etiology and pathogenesis of insomnia should be regarded cautiously.","Sanjari Moghaddam, Mohammadi, Dolatshahi, Mohebi, Ashrafi, Khazaie, Aarabi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110132","20201031","Connectivity; Diffusion tensor imaging; Microstructural abnormality; Primary insomnia; White matter","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16030,""
"StackGenVis: Alignment of Data, Algorithms, and Models for Stacking Ensemble Learning Using Performance Metrics","In machine learning (ML), ensemble methods-such as bagging, boosting, and stacking-are widely-established approaches that regularly achieve top-notch predictive performance. Stacking (also called &quot;stacked generalization&quot;) is an ensemble method that combines heterogeneous base models, arranged in at least one layer, and then employs another metamodel to summarize the predictions of those models. Although it may be a highly-effective approach for increasing the predictive performance of ML, generating a stack of models from scratch can be a cumbersome trial-and-error process. This challenge stems from the enormous space of available solutions, with different sets of data instances and features that could be used for training, several algorithms to choose from, and instantiations of these algorithms using diverse parameters (i.e., models) that perform differently according to various metrics. In this work, we present a knowledge generation model, which supports ensemble learning with the use of visualization, and a visual analytics system for stacked generalization. Our system, StackGenVis, assists users in dynamically adapting performance metrics, managing data instances, selecting the most important features for a given data set, choosing a set of top-performant and diverse algorithms, and measuring the predictive performance. In consequence, our proposed tool helps users to decide between distinct models and to reduce the complexity of the resulting stack by removing overpromising and underperforming models. The applicability and effectiveness of StackGenVis are demonstrated with two use cases: a real-world healthcare data set and a collection of data related to sentiment/stance detection in texts. Finally, the tool has been evaluated through interviews with three ML experts.","Chatzimparmpas, Martins, Kucher, Kerren","https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030352","20201022","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16031,""

With patients still suffering from complications and stroke recurrence, more questions have been raised as to how we can better improve patient management. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) were adopted to ensure a comprehensive inclusion of quality literature from various sources. PubMed and Embase were searched for evidence on thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, artificial intelligence (AI), antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation and hypertension management. The directions of future research in these areas are dependent on the current level of validation. Endovascular therapy and applications of AI are relatively new compared to the other areas discussed in this review. As such, it is important for future studies to focus on validating their efficacy.

"CT Quantification and Machine-learning Models for Assessment of Disease Severity and Prognosis of COVID-19 Patients","This study was to investigate the CT quantification of COVID-19 pneumonia and its impacts on the assessment of disease severity and the prediction of clinical outcomes in the management of COVID-19 patients. Ninety-nine COVID-19 patients who were confirmed by positive nucleic acid test (NAT) of RT-PCR and hospitalized from January 19, 2020 to February 19, 2020 were collected for this retrospective study. All patients underwent arterial blood gas test, routine blood test, chest CT examination, and physical examination on admission. In addition, follow-up clinical data including the disease severity, clinical treatment, and clinical outcomes were collected for each patient. Lung volume, lesion volume, nonlesion lung volume (NLLV) (lung volume - lesion volume), and fraction of nonlesion lung volume (%NLLV) (nonlesion lung volume / lung volume) were quantified in CT images by using two U-Net models trained for segmentation of lung and COVID-19 lesions in CT images. Furthermore, we calculated 20 histogram textures for lesions volume and NLLV, respectively. To investigate the validity of CT quantification in the management of COVID-19, we built random forest (RF) models for the purpose of classification and regression to assess the disease severity (Moderate, Severe, and Critical) and to predict the need and length of ICU stay, the duration of oxygen inhalation, hospitalization, sputum NAT-positive, and patient prognosis. The performance of RF classifiers was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and that of RF regressors using the root-mean-square error. Patients were classified into three groups of disease severity: moderate (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯25), severe (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯47) and critical (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯27), according to the clinical staging. Of which, a total of 32 patients, 1 (1/25) moderate, 6 (6/47) severe, and 25 critical (25/27), respectively, were admitted to ICU. The median values of ICU stay were 0, 0, and 12 days, the duration of oxygen inhalation 10, 15, and 28 days, the hospitalization 12, 16, and 28 days, and the sputum NAT-positive 8, 9, and 13 days, in three severity groups, respectively. The clinical outcomes were complete recovery (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯3), partial recovery with residual pulmonary damage (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯80), prolonged recovery (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯15), and death (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1). The %NLLV in three severity groups were 92.18 Ã‚Â± 9.89%, 82.94 Ã‚Â± 16.49%, and 66.19 Ã‚Â± 24.15% with p value &lt;0.05 among each two groups. The AUCs of RF classifiers using hybrid models were 0.927 and 0.929 in classification of moderate vs (severeÃ¢â‚¬Â¯+Ã¢â‚¬Â¯critical), and severe vs critical, respectively, which were significantly higher than either radiomics models or clinical models (p &lt; 0.05). The root-mean-square errors of RF regressors were 0.88 weeks for prediction of duration of hospitalization (mean: 2.60 Ã‚Â± 1.01 weeks), 0.92 weeks for duration of oxygen inhalation (mean: 2.44 Ã‚Â± 1.08 weeks), 0.90 weeks for duration of sputum NAT-positive (mean: 1.59 Ã‚Â± 0.98 weeks), and 0.69 weeks for stay of ICU (mean: 1.32 Ã‚Â± 0.67 weeks), respectively. The AUCs for prediction of ICU treatment and prognosis (partial recovery vs prolonged recovery) were 0.945 and 0.960, respectively. CT quantification and machine-learning models show great potentials for assisting decision-making in the management of COVID-19 patients by assessing disease severity and predicting clinical outcomes.","Cai, Liu, Xue, Luo, Wang, Shen, Fang, Sheng, Chen, Liang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2020.09.004","20201020","COVID-19; Computed tomography; Machine-learning; Novel coronavirus pneumonia; Quantitative image analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16033,""
"Disclosing Adverse Events in Clinical Practice: The Delicate Act of Being Open","Practicing a &quot;safe&quot; disclosure of adverse events remains challenging for healthcare professionals. In addition, knowledge on <i>how</i> to deliver a disclosure is still limited. This review focuses on how disclosure communication may be practiced based on the perspectives of patients and healthcare professionals. Empirical studies conducted between September 2008 and October 2019 were included from the databases PubMed, Web of Science and Psychinfo. After full text analysis and quality appraisal this scoping review included a total of 23 studies out of 2537 studies. As a first step, the needs of patients and the challenges of healthcare professionals with the practice of providing an effective disclosure were extracted from the empirical literature. Based on these findings, the review demonstrates that specific disclosure communication strategies on the level of interpersonal skills, organization, and supportive factors may facilitate healthcare professionals to provide optimal disclosure of adverse events. These may be relevant to provide patients with a tailored approach that accompanies their preferences for information and recognition. In conclusion, healthcare professionals may need training in interpersonal (verbal and nonverbal) communication skills. Furthermore, it is important to develop an open (organizational) culture that supports the communication of adverse events and disclosure as a standard practice.","Myren, de Hullu, Bastiaans, Koksma, Hermens, Zusterzeel","https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1830550","20201013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16034,""
"Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Battling Against Covid-19: A Literature Review","Colloquially known as coronavirus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that causes CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a matter of grave concern for every country around the world.

To manage the problems, many research in a variety of area of science have started studying the issue. Artificial Intelligence is among the area of science that has found great applications in tackling the problem in many aspects. Here, we perform an overview on the applications of AI in a variety of fields including diagnosis of the disease via different types of tests and symptoms, monitoring patients, identifying severity of a patient, processing covid-19 related imaging tests, epidemiology, pharmaceutical studies, etc. The aim of this paper is to perform a comprehensive survey on the applications of AI in battling against the difficulties the outbreak has caused. Thus we cover every way that AI approaches have been employed and to cover all the research until the writing of this paper. We try organize the works in a way that overall picture is comprehensible.

"Democratizing EHR analyses with FIDDLE: a flexible data-driven preprocessing pipeline for structured clinical data","In applying machine learning (ML) to electronic health record (EHR) data, many decisions must be made before any ML is applied; such preprocessing requires substantial effort and can be labor-intensive. As the role of ML in health care grows, there is an increasing need for systematic and reproducible preprocessing techniques for EHR data. Thus, we developed FIDDLE (Flexible Data-Driven Pipeline), an open-source framework that streamlines the preprocessing of data extracted from the EHR. Largely data-driven, FIDDLE systematically transforms structured EHR data into feature vectors, limiting the number of decisions a user must make while incorporating good practices from the literature. To demonstrate its utility and flexibility, we conducted a proof-of-concept experiment in which we applied FIDDLE to 2 publicly available EHR data sets collected from intensive care units: MIMIC-III and the eICU Collaborative Research Database. We trained different ML models to predict 3 clinically important outcomes: in-hospital mortality, acute respiratory failure, and shock. We evaluated models using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC), and compared it to several baselines. Across tasks, FIDDLE extracted 2,528 to 7,403 features from MIMIC-III and eICU, respectively. On all tasks, FIDDLE-based models achieved good discriminative performance, with AUROCs of 0.757-0.886, comparable to the performance of MIMIC-Extract, a preprocessing pipeline designed specifically for MIMIC-III. Furthermore, our results showed that FIDDLE is generalizable across different prediction times, ML algorithms, and data sets, while being relatively robust to different settings of user-defined arguments. FIDDLE, an open-source preprocessing pipeline, facilitates applying ML to structured EHR data. By accelerating and standardizing labor-intensive preprocessing, FIDDLE can help stimulate progress in building clinically useful ML tools for EHR data.","Tang, Davarmanesh, Song, Koutra, Sjoding, Wiens","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa139","20201011","electronic health records; machine learning; preprocessing pipeline","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16037,""

"The future of Cochrane Neonatal","Cochrane Neonatal was first established in 1993, as one of the original review groups of the Cochrane Collaboration. In fact, the origins of Cochrane Neonatal precede the establishment of the collaboration. In the 1980's, the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at Oxford, led by Dr. Iain Chalmers, established the &quot;Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials&quot; (ODPT), a register of virtually all randomized controlled trials in perinatal medicine to provide a resource for reviews of the safety and efficacy of interventions used in perinatal care and to foster cooperative and coordinated research efforts in the perinatal field [1]. An effort that was clearly ahead of its time, ODPT comprised four main elements: a register of published reports of trials; a register of unpublished trials; a register of ongoing and planned trials; and data derived from pooled overviews (meta-analyses) of trials. This core effort grew into the creation of the seminal books, &quot;Effective Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth&quot; as well as &quot;Effective Care of the Newborn Infant&quot; [2,3]. As these efforts in perinatal medicine grew, Iain Chalmers thought well beyond perinatal medicine into the creation of a worldwide collaboration that became Cochrane [4]. The mission of the Cochrane Collaboration is to promote evidence-informed health decision-making by producing high-quality, relevant, accessible systematic reviews and other synthesized research evidence (www.cochrane.org). Cochrane Neonatal has continued to be one of the most productive review groups, publishing between 25 tpo to 40 new or updated systematic reviews each year. The impact factor has been steadily increasing over four years and now rivals most of the elite journals in pediatric medicine. Cochrane Neonatal has been a worldwide effort. Currently, there are 404 reviews involving 1206 authors from 52 countries. What has Cochrane done for babies? Reviews from Cochrane Neonatal have informed guidelines and recommendations worldwide. From January 2018 through June 2020, 77 international guidelines cited 221 Cochrane Neonatal reviews. These recommendations have included recommendations of the use of postnatal steroids, inhaled nitric oxide, feeding guidelines for preterm infants and other core aspects of neonatal practice. In addition, Cochrane Reviews has been the impetus for important research, including the large-scale trial of prophylactic indomethacin therapy, a variety of trials of postnatal steroids, trials of emollient ointment and probiotic trials [6]. While justifiably proud of these accomplishments, one needs to examine the future contribution of Cochrane Neonatal to the neonatal community. The future of Cochrane Neonatal is inexorably linked to the future of neonatal research. Obviously, there is no synthesis of trials data if, as a community, we fail to provide the core substrate for that research. As we look at the current trials' environment, fewer randomized controlled trial related to neonates are being published in recent years. A simple search of PubMed, limiting the search to &quot;neonates&quot; and &quot;randomized controlled trials&quot; shows that in the year 2000, 321 randomized controlled trials were published. These peaked five years ago, in 2015, with close to 900 trials being published. However, in 2018, only 791 studies are identified. Does this decrease represent a meaningful change in the neonatal research environment? Quite possibly. There are shifting missions of clinical neonatology at academic medical institutions, at least in the United States, with a focus on business aspects as well as other important competing clinical activities. Quality improvement has taken over as one of the major activities at both private and academic neonatal practices. Clearly, this is a needed improvement. All units at levels need to be dedicated to improving the outcomes of the sick and fragile population we care for. However, this need not be at the expense of formal clinical trials. It is understandable that this approach would be taken. Newer interventions frequently relate to complex systems of care and not the simple single interventions. Even trials that might traditionally have been done as randomized controlled trials, such as the introduction of a new mode of ventilation, are in reality complex challenges to the ability of institutions to create systems to adapt to these new technologies. Cost of doing trials has always been a barrier. The challenging regulatory and ethical environment contributes to these problems as well [7]. Despite these barriers, how does the research agenda of the neonatal community move forward in the 21st Century? We need to reassess how we create and disseminate our research findings. Innovative trial designs will allow us to address complex issues that we may not have tackled with conventional trials. Adaptive designs may allow us to look at potentially life-saving therapies in a way that feel more efficient and more ethical [8]. Clarifying issues such as the use of inhaled nitric oxide in preterm infants would be greatly served if we even knew whether or not there are hypoxemic preterm infant who would benefit from this therapy [9]. Current trials do not suggest so, yet current practice tells us that a significant number of these babies will receive inhaled nitric oxide [10-13]. Adaptive design, such as those done with trials of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), would allow us to quickly assess whether, in fact, these therapies are life-saving and allow us to consider whether or not further trials are needed [14,15]. Our understanding that many interventions involve entire systems approaches does not relegate us only to doing quality improvement work. Cluster designs may allow us to test more complex interventions that have usually been under the purview of quality improvement [16-18]. Cluster trials are well suited for such investigations and can be done with the least interruption to ongoing care. Ultimately, quality improvement is the application of the best evidence available (evidence-based medicine is &quot;what to do&quot; and evidence-based practice is &quot;how to do&quot;). [19,20]. Nascent efforts, such as the statement on &quot;embedding necessary research into culture and health&quot; (the ENRICH statement) call for the conduct of large, efficient pragmatic trials to evaluate neonatal outcomes, as in part called for in the ALPHA Collaboration [21,22]. This statement envisions an international system to identify important research questions by consulting regularly with all stakeholders, including patients, public health professionals, researchers, providers, policy makers, regulators, funders of industry. The ENRICH statement envisions a pathway to enable individuals, educational institutions, hospitals and health-care facilities to confirm their status as research-friendly by integrating an understanding of trials, other research and critical thinking and to teaching learning and culture, as well as an engagement with funders, professional organizations and regulatory bodies and other stake holders to raise awareness of the value of efficient international research to reduce barriers to large international pragmatic trials and other collaborative studies. In the future, if trials are to be done on this scale or trials are prospectively designed to be analyzed together, core outcome measures must be identified and standardized. That clinical trials supply estimates of outcomes that are relevant to patients and their families is critical. In addition, current neonatal research evaluates many different outcomes using multiple measures. A given measure can have multiple widely used definitions. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (or chronic lung disease just to add to the confusion) quickly comes to mind [23,24]. The use of multiple definitions when attempting to measure the same outcome prevents synthesis of trial results and meta-analysis and hinders efforts to refine our estimates of effects. Towards that end, Webbe and colleagues have set out to develop a core outcome set for neonatal research [25]. Key stakeholders in the neonatal community reviewed multiple outcomes reported in neonatal trials and qualitative studies. Based on consensus, key outcome measures were identified, including survival, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, brain injury on imaging, retinopathy or prematurity, gross motor ability, general cognitive ability, quality of life, adverse events, visual impairment or blindness, hearing impairment or deafness, chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Trials registration has to be a continued focus of the neonatal community. Trials registration allows for systematic reviewers to understand whether or not reporting bias has occurred [26]. It also allows for transparent incorporation of these core outcome measures. Ultimately, trials registration should include public reporting of all of these core outcomes and, in the future, access to data on an individual level such that more sophisticated individual patient data meta-analysis could occur. Lastly, there is no reason to see clinical trials and quality improvement as separate or exclusive activities. In fact, in the first NICQ Collaborative, conducted by Vermont Oxford Network, participation in a trial of postnatal steroids was considered part of the quality improvement best practices as opposed to simply choosing an as-of-yet unproven approach to use of this potent drug [27]. What role will Cochrane Neonatal play as we move forward in the 21st Century? As the neonatal community moves forward with its' research agenda, Cochrane Neonatal must not only follow but also lead with innovative approaches to synthesizing research findings. Cochrane Neonatal must continue to work closely with guideline developers. The relationship between systematic review production and guideline development is clearly outlined in reports from the Institute of Medicine [28,29]. Both are essential to guideline development; the systematic review group culling the evidence for the benefits and harms of a given intervention and the guideline group addressing the contextual issues of cost, feasibility, implementation and the values and preferences of individuals and societies. Most national and international guidelines groups now routinely use systematic reviews as the evidence basis for their guidelines and recommendations. Examples of the partnership between Cochrane Neonatal and international guideline development can be seen in our support of the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on the use of vitamin A or the soon to be published recommendations from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) on cord management in preterm and term infants [30]. In the future, we need to collaborate early in the guideline development process so that the reviews are fit for purpose and meet the needs of the guideline developers and the end users. Towards this end, all Cochrane Neonatal reviews now contain GRADE assessments of the key clinical findings reported in the systematic review [31]. Addition of these assessments addresses the critical issue of our confidence in the findings. We are most confident in evidence provided by randomized controlled trials but this assessment can be can be downgraded if the studies that reported on the outcome in question had a high risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency of results, or imprecision, or where there is evidence of reporting bias. Information provided by GRADE assessments is seen as critical in the process of moving from the evidence to formal recommendations [32]. We need to explore complex reviews, such as network (NMA) or multiple treatment comparison (MCT) meta-analyses, to address issues not formally addressed in clinical trials [33]. In conditions where there are multiple effective interventions, it is rare for all possible interventions to have been tested against each other [34]. A solution could be provided by network meta-analysis, which allows for comparing all treatments with each other, even if randomized controlled trials are not available for some treatment comparisons [34]. Network meta-analysis uses both direct (head-to-head) randomized clinical trial (RCT) evidence as well as indirect evidence from RCTs to compare the relative effectiveness of all included interventions [35]. However, Mills and colleagues note that the methodological quality of MTCs may be difficult for clinicians to interpret because the number of interventions evaluated may be large and the methodological approaches may be complex [35]. Cochrane Neonatal must take a role in both the creation of such analyses and the education of the neonatal community regarding the pitfalls of such an approach. The availability of individual patient data will make more sophisticated analyses more available to the community. Although the current crop of individual patient data meta-analyses (including the reviews of elective high frequency ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide and oxygen targets) have not differed substantially from the findings of the trials level reviews (suggesting that, in fact, sick neonates are more alike that unalike), there still will be a large role for individual patient data meta-analysis, at least to end the unfound conclusions that these therapies are effective in various subgroups (be it issues of sex, disease severity, or clinical setting) [36-39]. Future trials should take a lesson from the NeOProM Collaborative [37,39]. Given the difficulty in generating significant sample size and creating funding in any single environment, trials with similar protocols should be conducted in a variety of healthcare settings with an eye towards both study level and individual patient level meta-analysis at the conclusion of those trials, allowing for broader contribution to the trials data, more rapid accrual of sample size, and more precise results. We need to educate the neonatal community regarding the use and abuse of diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests are a critical component of healthcare but also contribute greatly to the cost of medical care worldwide. These costs include the cost of the tests themselves and the costs of misdiagnosis and treatment of individuals who will not benefit from those treatments. Clinicians may have a limited understanding of diagnostic test accuracy, the ability of a diagnostic test to distinguish between patients with and without the disease or target condition [41,42]. Efforts such as Choosing Wisely have tried to identify these deficiencies [40]. As Cochrane has increased the general literacy of both the medical and general population regarding the interpretation of the results of interventions on various diseases, so should Cochrane move forward and improve the understanding of diagnostic testing. We need to become more efficient at creating and maintaining our reviews. The time spent to produce systematic reviews is far too great. In average, it takes between 2Ã‚Â½ to 6Ã‚Â½Ã‚Â years to produce a systematic review, requiring intense time input for highly trained and expensive experts. Innovations in the ways in which we produce systematic reviews can make the review process more efficient by outsourcing some of the tasks or crowdsourcing to machine learning. We need to let the crowd and machine learning innovations help us sort the massive amounts of information needed to conduct systematic reviews. It can also allow for &quot;live&quot; updating of critical reviews where the research landscape is quickly changing [43]. Lastly, Cochrane Neonatal must focus more on users of the reviews and not necessarily authors of the reviews. Current Cochrane programming speaks of Cochrane training with an eye towards developing the skills of individuals who will conduct systematic reviews. While this is clearly needed and laudable, the fact of the matter is that most of the community will be &quot;users&quot; of the reviews. Individuals who need to understand how to use and interpret the findings of systematic reviews. These review users include clinicians, guideline developers, policy makers and families. Incorporation of GRADE guidelines has been a huge step in adding transparency to the level of uncertainty we have in our findings. From a family's perspective, we need to overcome the environment of mistrust or misunderstanding of scientific evidence and how we convey what we know, and our uncertainty about what we know, to parents and families.","Soll, Ovelman, McGuire","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105191","20201019","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16039,""
"Creativity and ADHD: A review of behavioral studies, the effect of psychostimulants and neural underpinnings","Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a debilitating disorder and most research therefore focuses on its deficits and its treatment. Research on the potential positive sides of ADHD is limited, and although a comprehensive overview of empirical studies on this subject is missing, it has been suggested that ADHD is associated with enhanced creativity. To identify important relations, trends and gaps in the literature, we review 31 behavioral studies on creativity and ADHD, distinguishing different research designs, age groups, creativity measurements and effects of psychostimulants, as well as reflecting the potential underlying neural mechanisms of creativity and ADHD. Most studies find evidence for increased divergent thinking for those with high ADHD scores (subclinical) but not for those with the disorder (clinical). The rates of creative abilities/achievements were high among both clinical and subclinical groups. We found no evidence for increased convergent thinking abilities in ADHD, nor did we find an overall negative effect of psychostimulants on creativity. Neuroscientific findings suggest candidate regions as well as mechanisms that should be studied further to increase our understanding of the relationship between creativity and ADHD. We propose research opportunities to boost the knowledge needed to better understand the potential positive side of ADHD.","Hoogman, Stolte, Baas, Kroesbergen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.09.029","20201101","ADHD; Attention; Convergent thinking; Creative achievements; Creativity; Default mode network; Divergent thinking; Dopamine genes; Executive network; Fronto-Striatal networks; Prefrontal cortex; Psychostimulants; striatum","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16040,""
"Long-term exposure to NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> and all-cause and respiratory mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis","WHO has published several volumes of Global Air Quality Guidelines to provide guidance on the health risks associated with exposure to outdoor air pollution. As new scientific evidence is generated, air quality guidelines need to be periodically revised and, where necessary, updated. The aims of the study were 1) to summarise the available evidence on the effect of long-term exposure to ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) on mortality; 2) and to assess concentration response functions (CRF), their shape and the minimum level of exposures measured in studies to support WHO's update of the global air quality guidelines. We conducted a systematic literature search of the Medline, Embase and Web of Science databases following a protocol proposed by WHO and applied Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting our results. Cohort studies in human populations (including sub-groups at risk) exposed to long-term concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>. Outcomes assessed were all-cause, respiratory, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Acute Lower Respiratory Infection (ALRI) mortality. Studies included in the meta-analyses were assessed using a new Risk of Bias instrument developed by a group of experts convened by WHO. Study results are presented in forest plots and quantitative meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models. The certainty of evidence was assessed using a newly developed adaptation of GRADE. The review identified 2068 studies of which 95 were subject to full-text review with 45 meeting the inclusion criteria. An update in September 2018 identified 159 studies with 1 meeting the inclusion criteria. Of the 46 included studies, 41 reported results for NO<sub>2</sub> and 20 for O<sub>3</sub>. The majority of studies were from the USA and Europe with the remainder from Canada, China and Japan. Forty-two studies reported results for all-cause mortality and 22 for respiratory mortality. Associations for NO<sub>2</sub> and mortality were positive; random-effects summary relative risks (RR) were 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.04), 1.03 (1.00, 1.05), 1.03 (1.01, 1.04) and 1.06 (1.02, 1.10) per 10Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼g/m<sup>3</sup> for all-cause (24 cohorts), respiratory (15 cohorts), COPD (9 cohorts) and ALRI (5 cohorts) mortality respectively. The review identified high levels of heterogeneity for all causes of death except COPD. A small number of studies investigated the shape of the concentration-response relationship and generally found little evidence to reject the assumption of linearity across the concentration range. Studies of O<sub>3</sub> using annual metrics showed the associations with all-cause and respiratory mortality were 0.97 (0.93, 1.02) and 0.99 (0.89, 1.11) per 10Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼g/m<sup>3</sup> respectively. For studies using peak O<sub>3</sub> metrics, the association with all-cause mortality was 1.01 (1.00, 1.02) and for respiratory mortality 1.02 (0.99, 1.05), each per 10Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼g/m<sup>3</sup>. The review identified high levels of heterogeneity. Few studies investigated the shape of the concentration-response relationship. Certainty in the associations (adapted GRADE) with mortality was rated low to moderate for each exposure-outcome pair, except for NO<sub>2</sub> and COPD mortality which was rated high. The substantial heterogeneity for most outcomes in the review requires explanation. The evidence base is limited in terms of the geographical spread of the study populations and, for some outcomes, the small number of independent cohorts for meta-analysis precludes meaningful meta-regression to explore causes of heterogeneity. Relatively few studies assessed specifically the shape of the CRF or multi-pollutant models. The short-comings in the existing literature base makes determining the precise nature (magnitude and linearity) of the associations challenging. Certainty of evidence assessments were moderate or low for both NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> for all causes of mortality except for NO<sub>2</sub> and COPD mortality where the certainty of the evidence was judged as high.","Huangfu, Atkinson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105998","20201101","Cohort; Meta-analysis; Mortality; Nitrogen dioxide; Ozone; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16041,""
"Scientific Publications During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Topic Modeling Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has spread with alarming speed and an effective treatment for the disease is still lacking. The body of evidence on COVID-19 increases at an impressive pace, calling for a method to rapidly assess the current knowledge and identify key information. Gold standard methods, such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses are unsuitable due to their narrow scope and high time-consumption. To explore the published scientific literature on COVID-19 and map the research evolution during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed the titles, keywords, and abstracts of articles on COVID-19 from PubMed. We used latent Dirichlet allocation modeling to extract topics and conducted trend analysis to explore the temporal changes of research for each topic, journal impact factor (JIF), and geographical origin. Our search identified 16 670 relevant articles dated between February 14, 2020, and June 1, 2020. Of these articles, six were reports from peer-reviewed randomized trials on COVID-19 patients. We identified 14 main research topics. The most common topics were healthcare response, and clinical manifestations with 2 812/16 670 (16.9%) and 1 828/16 670 (11.0%) publications, respectively. We found a growing trend of publications on clinical manifestations, and protective measures, and a decrease in research on disease transmission, epidemiology, healthcare response, and radiology. Publications on protective measures, immunology, and clinical manifestations were associated with the highest JIF. We calculated an overall median JIF of 3.7 (IQR 2.6-5.9) and found that the publications' JIF declined over time. The top countries of research origin were the USA, China, Italy, and the UK. In less than six months since the detection of the novel coronavirus, a remarkably high number of articles on COVID-19 have been published. We present the temporal changes of the available COVID-19 research during the early phase of the pandemic. Our findings may aid researchers and policy makers to form a structured view of the current COVID-19 evidence base and provide further research directions.","Ãƒâ€žlgÃƒÂ¥, Eriksson, Nordberg","https://doi.org/10.2196/21559","20201008","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16042,""
"Proteomics and metabolomics in cow fertility: a systematic review","Cow subfertility is a multi-factorial problem in many countries which is only starting to be unravelled. Molecular biology can provide a substantial source of insight into its causes and potential solutions, particularly through large scale, untargeted omics approaches. In this systematic review, we set out to compile, assess and integrate the latest proteomic and metabolomic research on cow reproduction, specifically that on the female reproductive tract and early embryo. We herein report a general improvement in technical standards throughout the temporal span examined; however, significant methodological limitations are also identified. We propose easily actionable avenues for ameliorating these shortcomings and enhancing the reach of this field. Text mining and pathway analysis corroborate the relevance of proteins and metabolites related to the triad oxidative stress-inflammation-disease on reproductive function. We envisage a breakthrough in cattle reproductive molecular research within the next few years as in vivo sample techniques are improved, omics analysis equipment becomes more affordable and widespread, and software tools for single- and multi-omics data processing are further developed. Additional investigation of the impact of local oxidative stress and inflammation on fertility, both at the local and systemic levels, is key towards realising the full potential of this field.","Aranciaga, Morton, Berg, Gathercole","https://doi.org/10.1530/REP-20-0047","20201009","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16043,""
"The Analgesic Effect of Electroencephalographic Neurofeedback for People With Chronic Pain: Protocol for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Chronic pain is a global health problem, affecting around 1 in 5 individuals in the general population. The understanding of the key role of functional brain alterations in the generation of chronic pain has led researchers to focus on pain treatments that target brain activity. Electroencephalographic neurofeedback attempts to modulate the power of maladaptive electroencephalography frequency powers to decrease chronic pain. Although several studies have provided promising evidence, the effect of electroencephalographic neurofeedback on chronic pain is uncertain. This systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence from randomized controlled trials to evaluate the analgesic effect of electroencephalographic neurofeedback. In addition, we will synthesize the findings of nonrandomized studies in a narrative review. We will apply the search strategy in 5 electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and CINAHL) for published studies and in clinical trial registries for completed unpublished studies. We will include studies that used electroencephalographic neurofeedback as an intervention for people with chronic pain. Risk-of-bias tools will be used to assess methodological quality of the included studies. We will include randomized controlled trials if they have compared electroencephalographic neurofeedback with any other intervention or placebo control. The data from randomized controlled trials will be aggregated to perform a meta-analysis for quantitative synthesis. The primary outcome measure is pain intensity assessed by self-report scales. Secondary outcome measures include depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and sleep quality measured by self-reported questionnaires. We will investigate the studies for additional outcomes addressing adverse effects and resting-state electroencephalography analysis. Additionally, all types of nonrandomized studies will be included for a narrative synthesis. The intended and unintended effects of nonrandomized studies will be extracted and summarized in a descriptive table. Ethics approval is not required for a systematic review, as there will be no patient involvement. The search for this systematic review commenced in July 2020, and we expect to publish the findings in early 2021. This systematic review will provide recommendations for researchers and health professionals, as well as people with chronic pain, about the evidence for the analgesic effect of electroencephalographic neurofeedback.

We examined a corpus of -2.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°million free-text notes for 112,237 HHC episodes among 89,459 patients admitted to a non-profit HHC agency for post-acute care with any diagnosis. We used NLP software (NimbleMiner) to construct indicators of six neuropsychiatric symptoms. Structured HHC assessment data were used to identify known ADRD diagnoses and construct measures of hospitalization/ED use during HHC. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were documented for 40% of episodes. Common clusters included impaired memory, anxiety and/or depressed mood. One in three episodes without an ADRD diagnosis had documented symptoms. Hospitalization/ED rates increased with one or more symptoms present. HHC providers should examine episodes with neuropsychiatric symptoms but no ADRD diagnoses to determine whether ADRD diagnosis was missed or to recommend ADRD evaluation. NLP-generated symptom indicators can help to identify high-risk patients for targeted interventions.","Topaz, Adams, Wilson, Woo, Ryvicker","https://doi.org/10.1177/2333721420959861","20201010","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; dementia; electronic health record; home health care; natural language processing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16045,""
"Motion Capture Technology in Industrial Applications: A Systematic Review","The rapid technological advancements of Industry 4.0 have opened up new vectors for novel industrial processes that require advanced sensing solutions for their realization. Motion capture (MoCap) sensors, such as visual cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs), are frequently adopted in industrial settings to support solutions in robotics, additive manufacturing, teleworking and human safety. This review synthesizes and evaluates studies investigating the use of MoCap technologies in industry-related research. A search was performed in the Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Only studies in English, from 2015 onwards, on primary and secondary industrial applications were considered. The quality of the articles was appraised with the AXIS tool. Studies were categorized based on type of used sensors, beneficiary industry sector, and type of application. Study characteristics, key methods and findings were also summarized. In total, 1682 records were identified, and 59 were included in this review. Twenty-one and 38 studies were assessed as being prone to medium and low risks of bias, respectively. Camera-based sensors and IMUs were used in 40% and 70% of the studies, respectively. Construction (30.5%), robotics (15.3%) and automotive (10.2%) were the most researched industry sectors, whilst health and safety (64.4%) and the improvement of industrial processes or products (17%) were the most targeted applications. Inertial sensors were the first choice for industrial MoCap applications. Camera-based MoCap systems performed better in robotic applications, but camera obstructions caused by workers and machinery was the most challenging issue. Advancements in machine learning algorithms have been shown to increase the capabilities of MoCap systems in applications such as activity and fatigue detection as well as tool condition monitoring and object recognition.","Menolotto, Komaris, Tedesco, O'Flynn, Walsh","https://doi.org/10.3390/s20195687","20201015","IMU; health and safety; industry 4.0; motion tracking; robot control; wearable sensors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16046,""
"Sensitivity analysis of FDG PET tumor voxel cluster radiomics and dosimetry for predicting mid-chemoradiation regional response of locally advanced lung cancer","We investigated the sensitivity of regional tumor response prediction to variability in voxel clustering techniques, imaging features, and machine learning algorithms in 25 patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) enrolled on the FLARE-RT clinical trial. Metabolic tumor volumes (MTV) from pre-chemoradiation (PETpre) and mid-chemoradiation fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG PET) images (PETmid) were subdivided into K-means or hierarchical voxel clusters by standardized uptake values (SUV) and 3D-positions. MTV cluster separability was evaluated by CH index, and morphologic changes were captured by Dice similarity and centroid Euclidean distance. PETpre conventional features included SUVmean, MTV/MTV cluster size, and mean radiation dose. PETpre radiomics consisted of 41 intensity histogram and 3D texture features (PET Oncology Radiomics Test Suite) extracted from MTV or MTV clusters. Machine learning models (multiple linear regression, support vector regression, logistic regression, support vector machines) of conventional features or radiomic features were constructed to predict PETmid response. Leave-one-out-cross-validated root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) for continuous response regression (ÃŽâ€SUVmean) and area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) for binary response classification were calculated. K-means MTV 2-clusters (MTVhi, MTVlo) achieved maximum CH index separability (Friedman p &lt; 0.001). Between PETpre and PETmid, MTV cluster pairs overlapped (Dice 0.70-0.87) and migrated 0.6-1.1 cm. PETmid ÃŽâ€SUVmean response prediction was superior in MTV and MTVlo (RMSE = 0.17-0.21) compared to MTVhi (RMSE = 0.42-0.52, Friedman p &lt; 0.001). PETmid ÃŽâ€SUVmean response class prediction performance trended higher in MTVlo (AUC = 0.83-0.88) compared to MTVhi (AUC = 0.44-0.58, Friedman p = 0.052). Models were more sensitive to MTV/MTV cluster regions (Friedman p = 0.026) than feature sets/algorithms (Wilcoxon signed-rank p = 0.36). Top-ranked radiomic features included GLZSM-LZHGE (large-zone-high-SUV), GTSDM-CP (cluster-prominence), GTSDM-CS (cluster-shade) and NGTDM-CNT (contrast). Top-ranked features were consistent between MTVhi and MTVlo cluster pairs but varied between MTVhi-MTVlo clusters, reflecting distinct regional radiomic phenotypes. Variability in tumor voxel cluster response prediction can inform robust radiomic target definition for risk-adaptive chemoradiation in patients with LA-NSCLC.

"Applicability of radiomics in interstitial lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis: proof of concept","To retrospectively evaluate if texture-based radiomics features are able to detect interstitial lung disease (ILD) and to distinguish between the different disease stages in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) in comparison with mere visual analysis of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Sixty patients (46 females, median age 56 years) with SSc who underwent HRCT of the thorax were retrospectively analyzed. Visual analysis was performed by two radiologists for the presence of ILD features. Gender, age, and pulmonary function (GAP) stage was calculated from clinical data (gender, age, pulmonary function test). Data augmentation was performed and the balanced dataset was split into a training (70%) and a testing dataset (30%). For selecting variables that allow classification of the GAP stage, single and multiple logistic regression models were fitted and compared by using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated from the area under the curve (AUC) from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Values for some radiomics features were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) and those of other radiomics features were significantly higher (p = 0.001) in patients with GAP2 compared with those in patients with GAP1. The combination of two specific radiomics features in a multivariable model resulted in the lowest AIC of 10.73 with an AUC of 0.96, 84% sensitivity, and 99% specificity. Visual assessment of fibrosis was inferior in predicting individual GAP stages (AUC 0.86; 83% sensitivity; 74% specificity). The correlation of radiomics with GAP stage, but not with the visually defined features of ILD-HRCT, implies that radiomics might capture features indicating severity of SSc-ILD on HRCT, which are not recognized by visual analysis. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Radiomics features can predict GAP stage with a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of almost 100%. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Extent of fibrosis on HRCT and a combined model of different visual HRCT-ILD features perform worse in predicting GAP stage. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The correlation of radiomics with GAP stage, but not with the visually defined features of ILD-HRCT, implies that radiomics might capture features on HRCT, which are not recognized by visual analysis.","Martini, Baessler, Bogowicz, BlÃƒÂ¼thgen, Mannil, Tanadini-Lang, Schniering, Maurer, Frauenfelder","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07293-8","20201007","Artificial intelligence; Pulmonary fibrosis; Systemic sclerosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16048,""
"Using machine-learning risk prediction models to triage the acuity of undifferentiated patients entering the emergency care system: a systematic review","The primary objective of this review is to assess the accuracy of machine learning methods in their application of triaging the acuity of patients presenting in the Emergency Care System (ECS). The population are patients that have contacted the ambulance service or turned up at the Emergency Department. The index test is a machine-learning algorithm that aims to stratify the acuity of incoming patients at initial triage. This is in comparison to either an existing decision support tool, clinical opinion or in the absence of these, no comparator. The outcome of this review is the calibration, discrimination and classification statistics. Only derivation studies (with or without internal validation) were included. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed and the grey literature were searched on the 14th December 2019. Risk of bias was assessed using the PROBAST tool and data was extracted using the CHARMS checklist. Discrimination (C-statistic) was a commonly reported model performance measure and therefore these statistics were represented as a range within each machine learning method. The majority of studies had poorly reported outcomes and thus a narrative synthesis of results was performed. There was a total of 92 models (from 25 studies) included in the review. There were two main triage outcomes: hospitalisation (56 models), and critical care need (25 models). For hospitalisation, neural networks and tree-based methods both had a median C-statistic of 0.81 (IQR 0.80-0.84, 0.79-0.82). Logistic regression had a median C-statistic of 0.80 (0.74-0.83). For critical care need, neural networks had a median C-statistic of 0.89 (0.86-0.91), tree based 0.85 (0.84-0.88), and logistic regression 0.83 (0.79-0.84). Machine-learning methods appear accurate in triaging undifferentiated patients entering the Emergency Care System. There was no clear benefit of using one technique over another; however, models derived by logistic regression were more transparent in reporting model performance. Future studies should adhere to reporting guidelines and use these at the protocol design stage.

"Artificial intelligence in gastric cancer: Application and future perspectives","Gastric cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality across the globe, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 40%. In recent years, several applications of artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged in the gastric cancer field based on its efficient computational power and learning capacities, such as image-based diagnosis and prognosis prediction. AI-assisted diagnosis includes pathology, endoscopy, and computerized tomography, while researchers in the prognosis circle focus on recurrence, metastasis, and survival prediction. In this review, a comprehensive literature search was performed on articles published up to April 2020 from the databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Thereby the current status of AI-applications was systematically summarized in gastric cancer.

"What has social neuroscience learned from hyperscanning studies of spoken communication? A systematic review","A growing body of literature examining the neurocognitive processes of interpersonal linguistic interaction indicates the emergence of neural alignment as participants engage in oral communication. However, questions have arisen whether the study results can be interpreted beyond observations of cortical functionality and extended to the mutual understanding between communicators. This review presents evidence from electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning studies of interbrain synchrony (IBS) in which participants communicated via spoken language. The studies are classified into: knowledge sharing; turn-taking speech co-ordination; cooperation, problem-solving and creativity; and naturalistic discussion paradigms according to the type of interaction specified in each study. Alignment predominantly occurred in the frontal and temporo-parietal areas, which may reflect activation of the mirror and mentalizing systems. We argue that the literature presents a significant contribution to advancing our understanding of IBS and mutual understanding between communicators. We end with suggestions for future research, including analytical approaches and experimental conditions and hypothesize that brain-inspired neural networks are promising techniques for better understanding of IBS through hyperscanning.","Kelsen, Sumich, Kasabov, Liang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.09.008","20201020","Hyperscanning; Interbrain synchrony (IBS); Oral communication; Social interaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16053,""
"The Sickle Cell Disease Ontology: Enabling Collaborative Research and Co-Designing of New Planetary Health Applications","Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common blood disorders impacting planetary health. Over 300,000 newborns are diagnosed with SCD each year globally, with an increasing trend. The sickle cell disease ontology (SCDO) is the most comprehensive multidisciplinary SCD knowledge portal. The SCDO was collaboratively developed by the SCDO working group, which includes experts in SCD and data standards from across the globe. This expert review presents highlights and lessons learned from the fourth SCDO workshop that marked the beginning of applications toward planetary health impact, and with an eye to empower and cultivate multisite SCD collaborative research. The workshop was organized by the Sickle Africa Data Coordinating Center (SADaCC) and attended by 44 participants from 14 countries, with 2 participants connecting remotely. Notably, from the standpoint of democratizing and innovating scientific meeting design, an SCD patient advocate also presented at the workshop, giving a broader real-life perspective on patients' aspirations, needs, and challenges. A major component of the workshop was new approaches to harness SCDO to harmonize data elements used by different studies. This was facilitated by a web-based platform onto which participants uploaded data elements from previous or ongoing SCD-relevant research studies before the workshop, making multisite collaborative research studies based on existing SCD data possible, including multisite cohort, SCD global clinical trials, and SCD community engagement approaches. Trainees presented proposals for systematic literature reviews in key SCD research areas. This expert review emphasizes potential and prospects of SCDO-enabled data standards and harmonization to facilitate large-scale global SCD collaborative initiatives. As the fields of public and global health continue to broaden toward planetary health, the SCDO is well poised to play a prominent role to decipher SCD pathophysiology further, and co-design diagnostics and therapeutics innovation in the field.","Nembaware, Mazandu, Hotchkiss, Safari Serufuri, Kent, Kengne, Anie, Munung, Bukini, Bitoungui, Munube, Chirwa, Chunda-Liyoka, Jonathan, Flor-Park, Esoh, Jonas, Mnika, Oosterwyk, Masamu, Morrice, Uwineza, Nguweneza, Banda, Nyanor, Adjei, Siebu, Nkanyemka, Kuona, Tayo, Campbell, Oron, Nnodu, Painstil, Makani, Mulder, Wonkam","https://doi.org/10.1089/omi.2020.0153","20201028","Global Clinical Trial Design; Sickle Africa Data Coordinating Center; SickleInAfrica; data harmonization; planetary health; sickle cell disease; sickle cell disease ontology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16054,""
"Implementation of a Cohort Retrieval System for Clinical Data Repositories Using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model: Proof-of-Concept System Validation","Widespread adoption of electronic health records has enabled the secondary use of electronic health record data for clinical research and health care delivery. Natural language processing techniques have shown promise in their capability to extract the information embedded in unstructured clinical data, and information retrieval techniques provide flexible and scalable solutions that can augment natural language processing systems for retrieving and ranking relevant records. In this paper, we present the implementation of a cohort retrieval system that can execute textual cohort selection queries on both structured data and unstructured text-Cohort Retrieval Enhanced by Analysis of Text from Electronic Health Records (CREATE). CREATE is a proof-of-concept system that leverages a combination of structured queries and information retrieval techniques on natural language processing results to improve cohort retrieval performance using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model to enhance model portability. The natural language processing component was used to extract common data model concepts from textual queries. We designed a hierarchical index to support the common data model concept search utilizing information retrieval techniques and frameworks. Our case study on 5 cohort identification queries, evaluated using the precision at 5 information retrieval metric at both the patient-level and document-level, demonstrates that CREATE achieves a mean precision at 5 of 0.90, which outperforms systems using only structured data or only unstructured text with mean precision at 5 values of 0.54 and 0.74, respectively. The implementation and evaluation of Mayo Clinic Biobank data demonstrated that CREATE outperforms cohort retrieval systems that only use one of either structured data or unstructured text in complex textual cohort queries.","Liu, Wang, Wen, Wang, Hong, Shen, Bedrick, Hersh, Liu","https://doi.org/10.2196/17376","20201029","cohort retrieval; common data model; electronic health records; information retrieval; natural language processing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16055,""
"Cross-corpus Feature Learning between Spontaneous Monologue and Dialogue for Automatic Classification of Alzheimer's Dementia Speech","Speech analysis could help develop clinical tools for automatic detection of Alzheimer's disease and monitoring of its progression. However, datasets containing both clinical information and spontaneous speech suitable for statistical learning are relatively scarce. In addition, speech data are often collected under different conditions, such as monologue and dialogue recording protocols. Therefore, there is a need for methods to allow the combination of these scarce resources. In this paper, we propose two feature extraction and representation models, based on neural networks and trained on monologue and dialogue data recorded in clinical settings. These models are evaluated not only for AD recognition, but also with respect to their potential to generalise across both datasets. They provide good results when trained and tested on the same data set (72.56% UAR for monologue data and 85.21% for dialogue). A decrease in UAR is observed in transfer training, where feature extraction models trained on dialogues provide better average UAR on monologues (63.72%) than the other way around (58.94%). When the choice of classifiers is independent of feature extraction, transfer from monologue models to dialogues result in a maximum UAR of 81.04% and transfer from dialogue features to monologue achieve a maximum UAR of 70.73%, evidencing the generalisability of the feature model.","la Fuente Garcia, Haider, Luz","https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176305","20201027","Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Recognition, Psychology; Speech","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16056,""
"Understanding patient complaint characteristics using contextual clinical BERT embeddings","In clinical conversational applications, extracted entities tend to capture the main subject of a patient's complaint, namely symptoms or diseases. However, they mostly fail to recognize the characterizations of a complaint such as the time, the onset, and the severity. For example, if the input is &quot;I have a headache and it is extreme&quot;, state-of-the-art models only recognize the main symptom entity - headache, but ignore the severity factor of extreme, that characterises headache. In this paper, we design a two-fold approach to detect the characterizations of entities like symptoms presented by general users in contexts where they would describe their symptoms to a clinician. We use Word2Vec and BERT models to encode clinical text given by the patients. We transform the output and re-frame the task as a multi-label classification problem. Finally, we combine the processed encodings with the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm to classify the characterizations of the main entity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 40-50% improvement in the accuracy over the state-of-the-art models.","Saha, Lisboa, Ghosh","https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175577","20201027","Algorithms; Discriminant Analysis; Humans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16057,""
"Measuring Pain in Sickle Cell Disease using Clinical Text","Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a hereditary disorder of red blood cells in humans. Complications such as pain, stroke, and organ failure occur in SCD as malformed, sickled red blood cells passing through small blood vessels get trapped. Particularly, acute pain is known to be the primary symptom of SCD. The insidious and subjective nature of SCD pain leads to challenges in pain assessment among Medical Practitioners (MPs). Thus, accurate identification of markers of pain in patients with SCD is crucial for pain management. Classifying clinical notes of patients with SCD based on their pain level enables MPs to give appropriate treatment. We propose a binary classification model to predict pain relevance of clinical notes and a multiclass classification model to predict pain level. While our four binary machine learning (ML) classifiers are comparable in their performance, Decision Trees had the best performance for the multiclass classification task achieving 0.70 in F-measure. Our results show the potential clinical text analysis and machine learning offer to pain management in sickle cell patients.","Alambo, Andrew, Gollarahalli, Vaughn, Banerjee, Thirunarayan, Abrams, Shah","https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175599","20201027","Acute Pain; Anemia, Sickle Cell; Erythrocyte Count; Humans; Pain Management; Pain Measurement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16058,""
"A &quot;Verbal Thermometer&quot; for Assessing Neurodegenerative Disease: Automated Measurement of Pronoun and Verb Ratio from Speech","Clinicians often use speech to characterize neurodegenerative disorders. Such characterizations require clinical judgment, which is subjective and can require extensive training. Quantitative Production Analysis (QPA) can be used to obtain objective quantifiable assessments of patient functioning. However, such human-based analyses of speech are costly and time consuming. Inexpensive off-the-shelf technologies such as speech recognition and part of speech taggers may avoid these problems. This study evaluates the ability of an automatic speech to text transcription system and a part of speech tagger to assist with measuring pronoun and verb ratios, measures based on QPA. Five participant groups provided spontaneous speech samples. One group consisted of healthy controls, while the remaining groups represented four subtypes of frontotemporal dementia. Findings indicated measurement of pronoun and verb ratio was robust despite errors introduced by automatic transcription and the tagger and despite these off-the-shelf products not having been trained on the language obtained from speech of the included population.","Jarrold, Rofes, Wilson, Pressman, Stabler, Gorno-Tempini","https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176185","20201027","Frontotemporal Dementia; Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Pick Disease of the Brain; Speech; Thermometers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16059,""
"An Empirical Method of Automatic Pattern Extraction for Clinical Text Classification","Clinical text classification is an indispensable and extensively studied problem in medical text processing. Existing research primarily employs machine learning and pattern based approaches to address the stated problem. In general, pattern based approaches perform better than other methods. However, these approaches commonly require human intervention for pattern identification, which diminish their benefits and restrain their applications. In this study, we present a novel pattern extraction algorithm, which identifies and extracts patterns from clinical textual resources, automatically. The algorithm identifies the candidate concepts in the clinical text, finds the context of the concepts by discovering their context windows, and finally transforms each context window to a pattern. We evaluate our proposed algorithm on Hypertension, Rhinosinusitis, and Asthma guidelines. 70% of the hypertension guideline was used for pattern extraction while the remaining 30% and the other two guidelines were used for evaluations. The algorithm extracts 21 patterns that classify Hypertension, Rhinosinusitis, and Asthma guidelines sentences to the recommendation and non-recommendation sentences with 84.53%, 80.03%, and 84.62% accuracy, respectively.

"Assessment of Disease Progression in Friedreich Ataxia using an Instrumented Self Feeding Activity","Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the most common of the inherited ataxias, is a degenerative disease that progressively affects walking and other functions leading to significant impairment associated with a shortened lifespan. It is important to monitor the progression of ataxia over periods of time for clinical and therapeutic interventions. This study was aimed at investigating the use of our instrumented measurement scheme of utilizing a motion detecting spoon in a self-feeding activity to quantify the longitudinal effect of FRDA on upper limb function. Forty individuals diagnosed with FRDA (32.8Ã‚Â±14.9 years old) were recruited in a 12-month longitudinal study consisting of equal number of males and females (20). A set of biomarkers was extracted from the temporal and texture analysis of the movement time series data that objectively detected subtle changes during follow-up testing. The results indicated that both analyses generated features that resembled clinical ratings. Although the diagnosis and severity related performances were readily observed by temporal features, the longitudinal progression was better captured by the textural features (p = 0.029). The estimation of severity by mean of random forest regression model and LASSO exhibited a high degree of parity with the standard clinical scale (rho = 0.73, p &lt; 0.001).","Nguyen, Corben, Pathirana, Horne, Delatycki, Szmulewicz","https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175980","20201022","Adolescent; Adult; Ataxia; Disease Progression; Female; Friedreich Ataxia; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Walking; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16061,""
"Role of the Choroid in Automated Age-related Macular Degeneration Detection from Optical Coherence Tomography Images","Automatic detection of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images is often performed using the retinal layers only and choroid is excluded from the analysis. This is because symptoms of AMD manifest in the choroid only in the later stages and clinical literature is divided over the role of the choroid in detecting earlier stages of AMD. However, more recent clinical research suggests that choroid is affected at a much earlier stage. In the proposed work, we experimentally verify the effect of including the choroid in detecting AMD from OCT images at an intermediate stage. We propose a deep learning framework for AMD detection and compare its accuracies with and without including the choroid. Results suggest that including the choroid improves the AMD detection accuracy. In addition, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 96.78% which is comparable to the state-of-the-art works.","Srivastava, Ong, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175809","20201023","Choroid; Humans; Macular Degeneration; Retina; Tomography, Optical Coherence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16062,""

"Multi-View Ensemble Convolutional Neural Network to Improve Classification of Pneumonia in Low Contrast Chest X-Ray Images","Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of childhood mortality worldwide. Chest x-ray (CXR) can aid the diagnosis of pneumonia, but in the case of low contrast images, it is important to include computational tools to aid specialists. Deep learning is an alternative because it can identify patterns automatically, even in low-resolution images. We propose herein a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with different training strategies towards detecting pneumonia on CXRs and distinguishing its subforms of bacteria and virus. We also evaluated different image pre-processing methods to improve the classification. This study used CXRs from pediatric patients from a public pneumonia CXR dataset. The pre-processing methods evaluated were image cropping and histogram equalization. To classify the images, we adopted the VGG16 CNN and replaced its fully-connected layers with a customized multilayer perceptron. With this architecture, we proposed and evaluated four different training strategies: original CXR image (baseline), chest-cavity-cropped image (A), and histogram-equalized segmented image (B). The last strategy method (C) implemented is based on ensemble between strategies A and B. The performance was assessed by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval (CI), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. The ensemble model C yielded the highest performances: AUC of 0.97 (CI: 0.96-0.99) to classify pneumonia vs. normal, and AUC of 0.91 (CI: 0.88-0.94) to classify bacterial vs. viral cases. All models that used pre-processed images showed higher AUC than baseline, which used the original CXR image. Image cropping and histogram equalization reduced irrelevant information from the exam, enhanced contrast, and was able to identify fine CXR texture details. The proposed ensemble model increased the representation of inflammatory patterns from bacteria and viruses with few epochs to train the deep CNNs.Clinical relevance- Deep learning can identify complex radiographic patterns in low contrast images due to pneumonia and distinguish its subforms of bacteria and virus. The correlation of imaging with lab results could accelerate the adoption of complementary exams to confirm the disease's cause.","Ferreira, Armando Cardona Cardenas, Moreno, de Fatima de Sa Rebelo, Krieger, Antonio Gutierrez","https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176517","20201023","Child; Deep Learning; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Pneumonia; Thorax; X-Rays","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16064,""
"Neural Memory Networks for Seizure Type Classification","Classification of seizure type is a key step in the clinical process for evaluating an individual who presents with seizures. It determines the course of clinical diagnosis and treatment, and its impact stretches beyond the clinical domain to epilepsy research and the development of novel therapies. Automated identification of seizure type may facilitate understanding of the disease, and seizure detection and prediction have been the focus of recent research that has sought to exploit the benefits of machine learning and deep learning architectures. Nevertheless, there is not yet a definitive solution for automating the classification of seizure type, a task that must currently be performed by an expert epileptologist. Inspired by recent advances in neural memory networks (NMNs), we introduce a novel approach for the classification of seizure type using electrophysiological data.

"Interpreting Deep Neural Networks for Single-Lead ECG Arrhythmia Classification","Cardiac arrhythmia is a prevalent and significant cause of morbidity and mortality among cardiac ailments. Early diagnosis is crucial in providing intervention for patients suffering from cardiac arrhythmia. Traditionally, diagnosis is performed by examination of the Electrocardiogram (ECG) by a cardiologist. This method of diagnosis is hampered by the lack of accessibility to expert cardiologists. For quite some time, signal processing methods had been used to automate arrhythmia diagnosis. However, these traditional methods require expert knowledge and are unable to model a wide range of arrhythmia. Recently, Deep Learning methods have provided solutions to performing arrhythmia diagnosis at scale. However, the black-box nature of these models prohibit clinical interpretation of cardiac arrhythmia. There is a dire need to correlate the obtained model outputs to the corresponding segments of the ECG. To this end, two methods are proposed to provide interpretability to the models. The first method is a novel application of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) for visualizing the saliency of the CNN model. In the second approach, saliency is derived by learning the input deletion mask for the LSTM model. The visualizations are provided on a model whose competence is established by comparisons against baselines. The results of model saliency not only provide insight into the prediction capability of the model but also aligns with the medical literature for the classification of cardiac arrhythmia.Clinical relevance- Adapts interpretability modules for deep learning networks in ECG arrhythmia classfication, allowing for better clinical interpretation.","Vijayarangan, Murugesan, Vignesh, Preejith, Joseph, Sivaprakasam","https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176396","20201023","Algorithms; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Electrocardiography; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16066,""
"Automatic Detection of Respiratory Effort Related Arousals With Deep Neural Networks From Polysomnographic Recordings","Sleep disorders have become more common due to the modern lifestyle and stress. The most severe case of sleep disorders called apnea is characterized by a complete breaking block, leading to awakening and subsequent sleep disturbances. The automatic detection of sleep arousals is still challenging. In this paper, a novel method is presented to detect non-apnea sources of arousals during sleep using Polysomnography(PSG) recordings. After the preprocessing, a sequence-to-sequence deep neural network (DNNs) consisting of a series of Bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) layer, and fully connected layers were trained to classify samples in the segments. Initially, three different models were prepared for different datasets. Finally, obtaining the classification result through an ensemble model consisting of the three trained models. The result shows that the area under the receiver precision-recall curve (AUPRC) is 0.59 for the test dataset exceeding the performance of the classifiers in the existing literature.Clinical relevance- Analyzing Polysomnographic recordings is a time consuming a critical process yet to identify sleep disorders. These recordings span several hours and contain different data streams that include EEG, EMG, etc. This paper proposes a system that can automatically detect respiratory effort-related arousals using a deep neural network from Polysomnographic Recordings. By automating this process with a machine learning-based solution that can eliminate the manual process while facilitating further improvements of the system with future data.","Wickramaratne, Mahmud","https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176413","20201023","Arousal; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Polysomnography; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16067,""
"Bi-Directional Gated Recurrent Unit Based Ensemble Model for the Early Detection of Sepsis","Early prediction of sepsis is essential to give the patient timely treatment since each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with an increase in mortality. Current sepsis detection systems rely on empirical Clinical Decision Rules(CDR)s, which are based on vital signs that can be collected from the bedside. The main disadvantages of CDRs include questions of generalizability and performance variance when applied to the populations different from the groups used for derivation and often take years to develop and validate. This paper proposes a deep learning model using Bi-Directional Gated Recurrent Units(GRU), which uses a wide range of parameters that are associated with vitals, laboratory, and demographics of patients. The proposed model has an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.97, outperforming all the existing systems in the current literature. The model can handle the missing data, and irregular sampling intervals frequently present in medical records.Clinical relevance-The proposed model can be used to predict the onset of sepsis 6 hours ahead of time by the use of a machine learning algorithm.

"What Has Been Trending in the Research of Polyhydroxyalkanoates? A Systematic Review","Over the past decades, enormous progress has been achieved with regard to research on environmentally friendly polymers. One of the most prominent families of such biopolymers are bacterially synthesized polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) that have been known since the 1920s. However, only as recent as the 1990s have extensive studies sprung out exponentially in this matter. Since then, different areas of exploration of these intriguing materials have been uncovered. However, no systematic review of undertaken efforts has been conducted so far. Therefore, we have performed an unbiased search of up-to-date literature to reveal trending topics in the research of PHAs over the past three decades by data mining of 2,227 publications. This allowed us to identify eight past and current trends in this area. Our study provides a comprehensive review of these trends and speculates where PHA research is heading.","Guzik, Witko, SteinbÃƒÂ¼chel, Wojnarowska, SoÃ…â€štysik, Wawak","https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00959","20201006","biotechnology; composites; data mining; medicine; polyhydroxyalkanoate; polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthesis; renewable production; trends","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16069,""
"Cost-Effectiveness of Vitamin D Supplementation in Pregnant Woman and Young Children in Preventing Rickets: A Modeling Study","<b>Background:</b> Literature on the cost of management of rickets and cost-effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in preventing rickets is lacking. <b>Methods:</b> This study considered the cost-effectiveness of providing free vitamin D supplementation to pregnant women and children &lt;4 years of age with varying degrees of skin pigmentation to prevent rickets in children. Estimates for the prevalence of rickets were calculated using all cases of rickets diagnosed in Central Manchester, UK and census data from the region. Cost of management of rickets were calculated using National Health Service, UK tariffs. The efficacy of vitamin D supplementation was based on a similar programme implemented in Birmingham. Quality of life was assessed using utility estimates derived from a systematic literature review. In this analysis the intervention was considered cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is below the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, UK cost-effectiveness threshold of Ã‚Â£20,000 per Quality-adjusted life year (QALY). <b>Results:</b> Fifty-seven patients (26 dark, 29 medium and 2 light skin tones) were managed for rickets and associated complications over 4-years.

"How searching under time pressure impacts clinical decision making","Clinicians encounter many questions during patient encounters that they cannot answer. While search systems (e.g., PubMed) can help clinicians find answers, clinicians are typically busy and report that they often do not have sufficient time to use such systems. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of time pressure on clinical decisions made with the use of a medical literature search system. In stage 1, 109 final-year medical students and practicing clinicians were presented with 16 clinical questions that they had to answer using their own knowledge. In stage 2, the participants were provided with a search system, similar to PubMed, to help them to answer the same 16 questions, and time pressure was simulated by limiting the participant's search time to 3, 6, or 9 minutes per question. Under low time pressure, the correct answer rate significantly improved by 32% when the participants used the search system, whereas under high time pressure, this improvement was only 6%. Also, under high time pressure, participants reported significantly lower confidence in the answers, higher perception of task difficulty, and higher stress levels. For clinicians and health care organizations operating in increasingly time-pressured environments, literature search systems become less effective at supporting accurate clinical decisions. For medical search system developers, this study indicates that system designs that provide faster information retrieval and analysis, rather than traditional document search, may provide more effective alternatives.","van der Vegt, Zuccon, Koopman, Deacon","https://doi.org/10.5195/jmla.2020.915","20201006","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16072,""
"Effectiveness of Radiofrequency Ablation in the Treatment of Painful Osseous Metastases: A Correlation Meta-Analysis with Machine Learning Cluster Identification","A systematic review and meta-analysis of pain response after radiofrequency (RF) ablation over time for osseous metastases was conducted in 2019. Analysis used a random-effects model with GOSH plots and meta-regression. Fourteen studies comprising 426 patients, most with recalcitrant pain, were identified. Median pain reduction after RF ablation was 67% over median follow-up of 24 weeks (R<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -.66, 95% confidence intervalÃ‚Â -0.76 toÃ‚Â -0.55, I<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â = 71.24%, fail-safe NÃ‚Â = 875) with 44% pain reduction within 1 week.

Addition of cementoplasty after RF ablation did not significantly affect pain scores. Primary tumor type and tumor size did not significantly affect pain scores. A particular, positive association between pain after RF ablation and axial tumors was identified, implying possible increased palliative effects for RF ablation on axial over appendicular lesions.

"Prof Dimitar Hrisoho, Md, Phd, Founder of Nephrology in the R N Macedonia","Prof. Dr. Dimitar T. Hrisoho was born on June 11, 1924 in Bitola, R. Macedonia. He died in Struga on September 22, 1986, and was buried in Skopje. He completed primary and secondary education in Bitola. He graduated from the Medical Faculty in Belgrade in 1951 as one of the best students of his generation (average grade of 9.75). In 1953 he was employed at the Internal Clinic of the Medical Faculty in Skopje, where in 1955 he passed the specialist exam in internal medicine. He successfully defended his habilitation &quot;Polyarthritis chronica evolutiva&quot; and his doctoral dissertation &quot;Clinical features of Vitina nephropathy&quot;. The doctoral dissertation indicates that Vitina nephropathy is a new site of the Balkan Endemic Nephropathy entity and that more genetic testing of patients were needed. Based on numerous clinical and scientific researches published in over 200 papers, he was elected a Full Professor of internal medicine at the Medical Faculty of the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje in 1971. In 1970, he formed the nephrology section of the Macedonian Medical Association (MMA), which grew into the nephrology Association of MMA. Through the Association, the education of the medical staff from the field of nephrology was performed. He also set up a bio-cybernetics association. He achieved his vision and desire to transfer and apply the achievements of modern nephrology in the diagnosis and treatment of kidney patients in Macedonia at the Clinic of Nephrology of the Medical Faculty in Skopje, which was the first specialized institution established for examination and treatment of kidney patients in the former Yugoslavia and the Balkans. The Clinic educated nephrological staff and examined and treated kidney patients with new methods and drugs that positively affected the development of nephrology as a subspecialty of the internal medicine. D. Hrisoho was actively involved in the introduction of new methods for examination of kidney patients, as well as in the treatment of patients with acute and chronic renal insufficiency with dialysis since 1965. He also participated in the first two kidney transplantations from living donors performed in 1977. He wrote a chapter on &quot;kidney examination&quot;, printed in the book of Prof. A. J. Ignjatovski &quot;Fundamentals of Internal Propedeutics&quot; Part III, published by &quot;Prosvetno delo&quot;, 1963, in Skopje. This is the first text to investigate a patient with kidney disease published in a textbook in R. Macedonia. In 1984 he published the textbook &quot;Clinical Nephrology&quot; printed by the University of the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje. Prof. D. Hrisoho organized the First Scientific Meeting of Yugoslav Nephrologists with international participation, from 26 to 28 September 1977, in Struga, R. Macedonia. The meeting was attended by prominent nephrologists from the former Yugoslavia, the Balkans, Europe and the United States, among them: J.S. Cameron from UK, J.L. Funck-Brentano from France, M. Burg and P. Ivanovich from the USA, R. Kluthe from Germany and A. Puchlev from Bulgaria. The scientific meeting was the largest nephrology event until then organized in the former Yugoslavia. The meeting provided an exchange of experiences with world-renowned nephrologists. D. Hrisoho presented the paper Artificial intelligence in nephrology. The author tried to apply bio-cybernetics in nephrology. Prof. D. Hrisoho was Vice Dean of the Medical Faculty in Skopje in the period 1963-1965 and Vice Rector of the University of the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje in the period 1974-1975. Prof. Hrisoho was also active in socio-political organizations. For his medical, educational and scientific activities he received several awards and recognitions in the country and abroad. Thus, the work of Prof. D. Hrisoho was permanently embedded in the nephrology of R. Macedonia.","Polenakovic, Spasovski","https://doi.org/10.2478/prilozi-2020-0039","20201004","Clinic of Nephrology; First Scientific Meeting of Yugoslav Nephrologists; Vitina nephropathy; bio-cybernetics; dialysis; endemic nephropathy; interstitiopathies; nephrology; transplantations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16074,""

In this paper we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first such complete conversion method that is also capable of converting clinical terms into post-coordinated concepts which are not already listed in SNOMED CT. The method does not require any additional manual annotations and learns only from existing SNOMED CT terms paired with their concepts. The method is based on identifying the defining relations of the clinical concept expressed by a clinical term.

In this paper, we propose a Chinese NER method based on the multi-granularity semantic dictionary and multimodal tree method, which involves the following steps. First, we extract different semantic words using multimodal trees. Next, we extract the boundary information, and finally, perform the multi-granularity feature fusion.

"Multi-Ontology Refined Embeddings (MORE): A hybrid multi-ontology and corpus-based semantic representation model for biomedical concepts","Currently, a major limitation for natural language processing (NLP) analyses in clinical applications is that concepts are not effectively referenced in various forms across different texts. This paper introduces Multi-Ontology Refined Embeddings (MORE), a novel hybrid framework that incorporates domain knowledge from multiple ontologies into a distributional semantic model, learned from a corpus of clinical text. We use the RadCore and MIMIC-III free-text datasets for the corpus-based component of MORE. For the ontology-based part, we use the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) ontology and three state-of-the-art ontology-based similarity measures. In our approach, we propose a new learning objective, modified from the sigmoid cross-entropy objective function. We used two established datasets of semantic similarities among biomedical concept pairs to evaluate the quality of the generated word embeddings. On the first dataset with 29 concept pairs, with similarity scores established by physicians and medical coders, MORE's similarity scores have the highest combined correlation (0.633), which is 5.0% higher than that of the baseline model, and 12.4% higher than that of the best ontology-based similarity measure. On the second dataset with 449 concept pairs, MORE's similarity scores have a correlation of 0.481, based on the average of four medical residents' similarity ratings, and that outperforms the skip-gram model by 8.1%, and the best ontology measure by 6.9%. Furthermore, MORE outperforms three pre-trained transformer-based word embedding models (i.e., BERT, ClinicalBERT, and BioBERT) on both datasets. MORE incorporates knowledge from several biomedical ontologies into an existing corpus-based distributional semantics model, improving both the accuracy of the learned word embeddings and the extensibility of the model to a broader range of biomedical concepts. MORE allows for more accurate clustering of concepts across a wide range of applications, such as analyzing patient health records to identify subjects with similar pathologies, or integrating heterogeneous clinical data to improve interoperability between hospitals.","Jiang, Wu, Tomita, Ganoe, Hassanpour","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103581","20201025","Biomedical Ontology; Biomedical Semantic Representation; Distributional Semantics; Semantic Similarity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16077,""
"PROTAC-DB: an online database of PROTACs","Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which selectively degrade targeted proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, have emerged as a novel therapeutic technology with potential advantages over traditional inhibition strategies. In the past few years, this technology has achieved substantial progress and two PROTACs have been advanced into phase I clinical trials. However, this technology is still maturing and the design of PROTACs remains a great challenge. In order to promote the rational design of PROTACs, we present PROTAC-DB, a web-based open-access database that integrates structural information and experimental data of PROTACs. Currently, PROTAC-DB consists of 1662 PROTACs, 202 warheads (small molecules that target the proteins of interest), 65 E3 ligands (small molecules capable of recruiting E3 ligases) and 806 linkers, as well as their chemical structures, biological activities, and physicochemical properties. Except the biological activities of warheads and E3 ligands, PROTAC-DB also provides the degradation capacities, binding affinities and cellular activities for PROTACs. PROTAC-DB can be queried with two general searching approaches: text-based (target name, compound name or ID) and structure-based. In addition, for the convenience of users, a filtering tool for the searching results based on the physicochemical properties of compounds is also offered.

"Ada-WHIPS: explaining AdaBoost classification with applications in the health sciences","Computer Aided Diagnostics (CAD) can support medical practitioners to make critical decisions about their patients' disease conditions. Practitioners require access to the chain of reasoning behind CAD to build trust in the CAD advice and to supplement their own expertise. Yet, CAD systems might be based on black box machine learning models and high dimensional data sources such as electronic health records, magnetic resonance imaging scans, cardiotocograms, etc. These foundations make interpretation and explanation of the CAD advice very challenging. This challenge is recognised throughout the machine learning research community. eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is emerging as one of the most important research areas of recent years because it addresses the interpretability and trust concerns of critical decision makers, including those in clinical and medical practice. In this work, we focus on AdaBoost, a black box model that has been widely adopted in the CAD literature. We address the challenge - to explain AdaBoost classification - with a novel algorithm that extracts simple, logical rules from AdaBoost models. Our algorithm, Adaptive-Weighted High Importance Path Snippets (Ada-WHIPS), makes use of AdaBoost's adaptive classifier weights. Using a novel formulation, Ada-WHIPS uniquely redistributes the weights among individual decision nodes of the internal decision trees of the AdaBoost model. Then, a simple heuristic search of the weighted nodes finds a single rule that dominated the model's decision. We compare the explanations generated by our novel approach with the state of the art in an experimental study. We evaluate the derived explanations with simple statistical tests of well-known quality measures, precision and coverage, and a novel measure stability that is better suited to the XAI setting. Experiments on 9 CAD-related data sets showed that Ada-WHIPS explanations consistently generalise better (mean coverage 15%-68%) than the state of the art while remaining competitive for specificity (mean precision 80%-99%). A very small trade-off in specificity is shown to guard against over-fitting which is a known problem in the state of the art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the benefits of using our novel algorithm for explaining CAD AdaBoost classifiers widely found in the literature. Our tightly coupled, AdaBoost-specific approach outperforms model-agnostic explanation methods and should be considered by practitioners looking for an XAI solution for this class of models.","Hatwell, Gaber, Atif Azad","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-01201-2","20201006","AdaBoost; Black box problem; Computer aided diagnostics; Explainable AI; Interpretability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16079,""
"Highly multiplexed quantifications of 299 somatic mutations in colorectal cancer patients by automated MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry","Detection of somatic mutations in tumor tissues helps to understand tumor biology and guide treatment selection. Methods such as quantitative PCR can analyze a few mutations with high efficiency, while next generation sequencing (NGS) based methods can analyze hundreds to thousands of mutations. However, there is a lack of cost-effective method for quantitatively analyzing tens to a few hundred mutations of potential biological and clinical significance. Through a comprehensive database and literature review we selected 299 mutations associated with colorectal cancer. We then designed a highly multiplexed assay panel (8-wells covering 299 mutations in 109 genes) based on an automated MADLI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) platform. The multiplex panel was tested with a total of 319 freshly frozen tissues and 92 FFPE samples from 229 colorectal cancer patients, with 13 samples also analyzed by a targeted NGS method covering 532 genes. Multiplex somatic mutation panel based on MALDI-TOF MS detected and quantified at least one somatic mutation in 142 patients, with KRAS, TP53 and APC being the most frequently mutated genes. Extensive validation by both capillary sequencing and targeted NGS demonstrated high accuracy of the multiplex MS assay. Out of 35 mutations tested with plasmid constructs, sensitivities of 5 and 10% mutant allele frequency were achieved for 19 and 16 mutations, respectively. Automated MALDI-TOF MS offers an efficient and cost-effective platform for highly multiplexed quantitation of 299 somatic mutations, which may be useful in studying the biological and clinical significance of somatic mutations with large numbers of cancer tissues.","Xu, Peng, Li, Chen, Hu, Hou, Shang, Liang, Li, Li, Wu, Liu, Hu, Cai, Zhang, Chen, Yu, Zheng, Jiang, Luan, Jin, Ding","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12920-020-00804-y","20201006","Colorectal cancer; MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry; Multiplex detection; Somatic mutation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16080,""

The meta-analysis provided an odds ratio indicating significant association between smoking and the prevalence of extracted RFT (OR = 3.43, 95% CI = 1.17-10.05, <i>p</i> = 0.02, IÃ‚Â² = 64%). The certainty of the literature assessment was low per GRADE. Both studies were considered as moderate risk of bias. Tobacco smoking should be considered a negative prognostic factor for the outcome of root canal treatment, although the quality of the evidence is low. RFT of smoking patients are three times more likely to be extracted. Continuing to smoke after endodontic treatment may increase the risk of treatment failure. However, the overall strength of evidence is low. This must be considered a limitation of the present study and the conclusion should be valued with caution.","Cabanillas-Balsera, Segura-Egea, JimÃƒÂ©nez-SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Areal-Quecuty, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-DomÃƒÂ­nguez, Montero-Miralles, SaÃƒÂºco-MÃƒÂ¡rquez, MartÃƒÂ­n-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9103179","20201101","endodontic medicine; endodontics; root canal treatment outcome; root-filled teeth extraction; smoking habits; tobacco smoking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16081,""
"Citation screening using crowdsourcing and machine learning produced accurate results: evaluation of Cochrane's modified Screen4Me service","To assess the feasibility of a modified workflow that uses machine learning and crowdsourcing to identify studies for potential inclusion in a systematic review. This was a sub-study to a larger randomised study; the main study sought to assess the performance of single screening search results versus dual screening. This sub-study assessed the performance in identifying relevant RCTs for a published Cochrane review of a modified version of Cochrane's Screen4Me workflow which uses crowdsourcing and machine learning. We included participants who had signed up for the main study but who were not eligible to be randomised to the two main arms of that study. The records were put through the modified workflow where a machine learning classifier divided the dataset into &quot;Not RCTs&quot; and &quot;Possible RCTs&quot;. The records deemed &quot;Possible RCTs&quot; were then loaded into a task created on the Cochrane Crowd platform and participants classified those records as either &quot;Potentially relevant&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; to the review. Using a pre-specified agreement algorithm we calculated the performance of the crowd in correctly identifying the studies that were included in the review (sensitivity) and correctly rejecting those that were not included (specificity). The RCT machine learning classifier did not reject any of the included studies. In terms of the crowd, 112 participants were included in this sub-study. Of these, 81 completed the training module and went on to screen records in the live task. Applying the Cochrane Crowd agreement algorithm, the crowd achieved 100% sensitivity and 80.71% specificity. Using a crowd to screen search results for systematic reviews can be an accurate method as long as the agreement algorithm in place is robust.

"Exploiting Rules to Enhance Machine Learning in Extracting Information From Multi-Institutional Prostate Pathology Reports","Literature on clinical note mining has highlighted the superiority of machine learning (ML) over hand-crafted rules. Nevertheless, most studies assume the availability of large training sets, which is rarely the case. For this reason, in the clinical setting, rules are still common. We suggest 2 methods to leverage the knowledge encoded in pre-existing rules to inform ML decisions and obtain high performance, even with scarce annotations. We collected 501 prostate pathology reports from 6 American hospitals. Reports were split into 2,711 core segments, annotated with 20 attributes describing the histology, grade, extension, and location of tumors. The data set was split by institutions to generate a cross-institutional evaluation setting. We assessed 4 systems, namely a rule-based approach, an ML model, and 2 hybrid systems integrating the previous methods: a Rule as Feature model and a Classifier Confidence model. Several ML algorithms were tested, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB). When training on data from a single institution, LR lags behind the rules by 3.5% (F1 score: 92.2% <i>v</i> 95.7%). Hybrid models, instead, obtain competitive results, with Classifier Confidence outperforming the rules by +0.5% (96.2%). When a larger amount of data from multiple institutions is used, LR improves by +1.5% over the rules (97.2%), whereas hybrid systems obtain +2.2% for Rule as Feature (97.7%) and +2.6% for Classifier Confidence (98.3%). Replacing LR with SVM or XGB yielded similar performance gains. We developed methods to use pre-existing handcrafted rules to inform ML algorithms. These hybrid systems obtain better performance than either rules or ML models alone, even when training data are limited.","Santus, Schuster, Tahmasebi, Li, Yala, Lanahan, Prinsen, Thompson, Coons, Mynderse, Barzilay, Hughes","https://doi.org/10.1200/CCI.20.00028","20201005","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16083,""
"Artificial intelligence interventions focused on opioid use disorders: A review of the gray literature","With the artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm shift comes momentum toward the development and scale-up of novel AI interventions to aid in opioid use disorder (OUD) care, in the identification of overdose risk, and in the reversal of overdose. As OUD-specific AI interventions are relatively recent, dynamic, and may not yet be captured in the peer-reviewed literature, we conducted a review of the gray literature to identify literature pertaining to OUD-specific AI interventions being developed, implemented and evaluated. Gray literature databases, customized Google searches, and targeted websites were searched from January 2013 to October 2019. Search terms include: AI, machine learning, substance use disorder (SUD), and OUD. We also requested recommendations for relevant material from experts in this area. This review yielded a total of 70 unique citations and 29 unique interventions, which can be sub-divided into five categories: smartphone applications (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 12); healthcare data-related interventions (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7); biosensor-related interventions (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5); digital and virtual-related interventions (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2); and 'other', i.e., those that cannot be classified in these categories (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3). While the majority have not undergone rigorous scientific evaluation via randomized controlled trials, several AI interventions showed promise in aiding the identification of escalating opioid use patterns, informing the treatment of OUD, and detecting opioid-induced respiratory depression. This is the first gray literature synthesis to characterize the current 'landscape' of OUD-specific AI interventions. Future research should continue to assess the usability, utility, acceptability and efficacy of these interventions, in addition to the overall legal, ethical, and social implications of OUD-specific AI interventions.","Beaulieu, Knight, Nolan, Quick, Ti","https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2020.1817466","20201002","Artificial intelligence; interventions; opioid use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16084,""
"A microstructural neural network biomarker for dystonia diagnosis identified by a DystoniaNet deep learning platform","Isolated dystonia is a neurological disorder of heterogeneous pathophysiology, which causes involuntary muscle contractions leading to abnormal movements and postures. Its diagnosis is remarkably challenging due to the absence of a biomarker or gold standard diagnostic test. This leads to a low agreement between clinicians, with up to 50% of cases being misdiagnosed and diagnostic delays extending up to 10.1 y. We developed a deep learning algorithmic platform, DystoniaNet, to automatically identify and validate a microstructural neural network biomarker for dystonia diagnosis from raw structural brain MRIs of 612 subjects, including 392 patients with three different forms of isolated focal dystonia and 220 healthy controls. DystoniaNet identified clusters in corpus callosum, anterior and posterior thalamic radiations, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and inferior temporal and superior orbital gyri as the biomarker components. These regions are known to contribute to abnormal interhemispheric information transfer, heteromodal sensorimotor processing, and executive control of motor commands in dystonia pathophysiology. The DystoniaNet-based biomarker showed an overall accuracy of 98.8% in diagnosing dystonia, with a referral of 3.5% of cases due to diagnostic uncertainty. The diagnostic decision by DystoniaNet was computed in 0.36 s per subject. DystoniaNet significantly outperformed shallow machine-learning algorithms in benchmark comparisons, showing nearly a 20% increase in its diagnostic performance. Importantly, the microstructural neural network biomarker and its DystoniaNet platform showed substantial improvement over the current 34% agreement on dystonia diagnosis between clinicians. The translational potential of this biomarker is in its highly accurate, interpretable, and generalizable performance for enhanced clinical decision-making.","Valeriani, Simonyan","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009165117","20201022","biomarker; brain MRI; dystonia; machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16085,""
"Artificial intelligence in pulmonary medicine: computer vision, predictive model and COVID-19","Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare delivery. The digital revolution in medicine and healthcare information is prompting a staggering growth of data intertwined with elements from many digital sources such as genomics, medical imaging and electronic health records. Such massive growth has sparked the development of an increasing number of AI-based applications that can be deployed in clinical practice. Pulmonary specialists who are familiar with the principles of AI and its applications will be empowered and prepared to seize future practice and research opportunities. The goal of this review is to provide pulmonary specialists and other readers with information pertinent to the use of AI in pulmonary medicine. First, we describe the concept of AI and some of the requisites of machine learning and deep learning. Next, we review some of the literature relevant to the use of computer vision in medical imaging, predictive modelling with machine learning, and the use of AI for battling the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 pandemic. We close our review with a discussion of limitations and challenges pertaining to the further incorporation of AI into clinical pulmonary practice.","Khemasuwan, Sorensen, Colt","https://doi.org/10.1183/16000617.0181-2020","20201015","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Machine Learning; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pulmonary Medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16086,""
"Korean clinical entity recognition from diagnosis text using BERT","While clinical entity recognition mostly aims at electronic health records (EHRs), there are also the demands of dealing with the other type of text data. Automatic medical diagnosis is an example of new applications using a different data source. In this work, we are interested in extracting Korean clinical entities from a new medical dataset, which is completely different from EHRs. The dataset is collected from an online QA site for medical diagnosis. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which is one of the best language representation models, is used to extract the entities. A slightly modified version of BERT labeling strategy replaces the original labeling to enhance the separation of postpositions in Korean. A new clinical entity recognition dataset that we construct, as well as a standard NER dataset, have been used for the experiments. A pre-trained multilingual BERT model is used for the initialization of the entity recognition model. BERT significantly outperforms a character-level bidirectional LSTM-CRF, a benchmark model, in terms of all metrics. The micro-averaged precision, recall, and f1 of BERT are 0.83, 0.85 and 0.84, whereas that of bi-LSTM-CRF are 0.82, 0.79 and 0.81 respectively. The recall values of BERT are especially better than that of the other model. It can be interpreted that the trained BERT model could detect out of vocabulary (OOV) words better than bi-LSTM-CRF. The recently developed BERT and its WordPiece tokenization are effective for the Korean clinical entity recognition. The experiments using a new dataset constructed for the purpose and a standard NER dataset show the superiority of BERT compared to a state-of-the-art method. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the first studies dealing with clinical entity extraction from non-EHR data.","Kim, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-01241-8","20201003","BERT; Clinical entity recognition; Diagnosis text; Korean","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16087,""
"Deep learning networks on chronic liver disease assessment with fine-tuning of shear wave elastography image sequences","Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) is currently one of the major causes of death worldwide. If not treated, it may lead to cirrhosis, hepatic carcinoma, and death. Ultrasound (US) Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) is a relatively new, popular, non-invasive technique among radiologists. Although many studies have been published validating the SWE technique either in a clinical setting, or by applying machine learning on SWE elastograms, minimal work has been made on comparing the performance of popular pre-trained deep learning networks on CLD assessment. Currently available literature reports suggest technical advancements on specific deep learning structures, with specific inputs and usually on a limited CLD fibrosis stage class group, with limited comparison on competitive deep learning schemes fed with different input types. The aim of the present study is to compare some popular deep learning pre-trained networks using temporally stable and full elastograms, with or without augmentation as well as propose suitable deep learning schemes for CLD diagnosis and progress assessment. 200 liver biopsy validated patients with CLD, underwent US SWE examination. Four images from the same liver area were saved to extract elastograms and processed to exclude areas that were temporally unstable. Then, full and temporally stable masked elastograms for each patient were separately fed into GoogLeNet, AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet50 and DenseNet201 with and without augmentation. The networks were tested for differentiation of CLD stages in seven classification schemes over 30 repetitions using liver biopsy as reference. All Networks achieved maximum mean accuracies ranging from 87.2%-97.4% and AUCs ranging from 0.979-0.990 while the radiologists had AUCs ranging from 0.800-0.870. ResNet50 and DenseNet201 had better average performance than the other networks. The use of the temporal stability mask led to improved performance on about 50% of inputs and networks combinations while augmentation led to lower performance for all networks. These findings can provide potential networks with higher accuracy and better setting in the CLD diagnosis and progress assessment. A larger dataset would help identify the best network and settings for CLD assessment in clinical practice.","Kagadis, Drazinos, Gatos, Tsantis, Papadimitroulas, Spiliopoulos, Karnabatidis, Theotokas, Zoumpoulis, Hazle","https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/abae06","20201001","CAD; CLD; Deep Learning; Shear wave; quantitative imaging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16088,""
"Analysis of COVID-19 clinical trials: A data-driven, ontology-based, and natural language processing approach","With the novel COVID-19 pandemic disrupting and threatening the lives of millions, researchers and clinicians have been recently conducting clinical trials at an unprecedented rate to learn more about the virus and potential drugs/treatments/vaccines to treat its infection.

"Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Behavior Change Model for Designing Artificial Intelligence Chatbots to Promote Physical Activity and a Healthy Diet: Viewpoint","Chatbots empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) can increasingly engage in natural conversations and build relationships with users. Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy diet. The purposes of this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, describe the AI chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive interdisciplinary research, and discuss ethical principles and considerations. We conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing. Based on the identified gaps and opportunities, as well as our own clinical and research experience and findings, we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model. Our review found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs. The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics and understanding user background; (2) building relational capacity; (3) building persuasive conversational capacity; and (4) evaluating mechanisms and outcomes. The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation choices for this model are presented in this paper. As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into various digital communications, our proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and evaluation. There is a need for more interdisciplinary work to continue developing AI techniques to improve a chatbot's relational and persuasive capacities to change physical activity and diet behaviors with strong ethical principles.","Zhang, Oh, Lange, Yu, Fukuoka","https://doi.org/10.2196/22845","20201101","artificial intelligence; behavior change; chatbot; communication; conversational agent; diet; intervention; natural language processing; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16090,""
"Towards development of a novel universal medical diagnostic method: Raman spectroscopy and machine learning","Many problems exist within the myriad of currently employed screening and diagnostic methods. Further, an incredibly wide variety of procedures are used to identify an even greater number of diseases which exist in the world. There is a definite unmet clinical need to improve diagnostic capabilities of these procedures, including improving test sensitivity and specificity, objectivity and definitiveness, and reducing cost and invasiveness of the test, with an interest in replacing multiple diagnostic methods with one powerful tool. There has been a recent surge in the literature which focuses on utilizing Raman spectroscopy in combination with machine learning analyses to improve diagnostic measures for identifying an assortment of diseases, including cancers, viral and bacterial infections, neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders, and more. This review highlights the work accomplished since 2018 which focuses on using Raman spectroscopy and machine learning to address the need for better screening and medical diagnostics in all areas of disease. A critical evaluation considers both the benefits and obstacles of utilizing the method for universal diagnostics.

"The Effects of Acupuncture on Cancer-Related Fatigue: Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Several studies have identified fatigue as one of the major symptoms experienced during and after cancer treatment. However, there are limited options to manage cancer related fatigue (CRF) with pharmacological interventions. Several acupuncture studies suggested that acupuncture has a positive impact on CRF. This review aims to assess the evidence of acupuncture for the treatment of CRF. Electronic database searches were conducted on 4 English databases (Medline, PubMed, Embase, and ScienceDirect). Search keywords were; &quot;acupuncture&quot; and &quot;cancer,&quot; or &quot;cancer related fatigue.&quot; Studies published as full text randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in English were included. Estimates of change in fatigue cores were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis where randomized comparisons were available for true acupuncture versus sham acupuncture and true acupuncture versus usual care. The quality of original papers were assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (ROB). Nine RCTs were selected for review with a total of 809 participants and a range of 13 to 302 participants within the studies. Six RCTs reported significant improvement of CRF for the acupuncture intervention compared to the control groups. Pooled estimates suggest Brief Fatigue Inventory scores are 0.93Ã¢â‚¬â€°points lower 95% CI (-1.65, -0.20) in true acupuncture versus sham acupuncture and 2.12Ã¢â‚¬â€°points lower 95% C (-3.21, -1.04) in true acupuncture versus usual care. Six studies had low risk of bias (ROB) and 3 studies had a moderate ROB predominantly in blinding of participants, blinding of assessors and incomplete data outcomes. Among the 9 RCTs, 2 studies have reported the occurrence of minor adverse effects (spot bleeding and bruising) related to acupuncture treatment. No serious adverse reactions related to acupuncture were reported. The current literature review suggests that acupuncture has therapeutic potential in management of CRF for cancer survivors. Promotion of acupuncture in cancer care to manage CRF may improve the quality of life of cancer survivors.","Jang, Brown, Lamoury, Morgia, Boyle, Marr, Clarke, Back, Oh","https://doi.org/10.1177/1534735420949679","20201016","acupuncture; cancer; cancer related fatigue; fatigue","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16093,""
"Enhancement of needle visualization and localization in ultrasound","This scoping review covers needle visualization and localization techniques in ultrasound, where localization-based approaches mostly aim to compute the needle shaft (and tip) location while potentially enhancing its visibility too. A literature review is conducted on the state-of-the-art techniques, which could be divided into five categories: (1) signal and image processing-based techniques to augment the needle, (2) modifications to the needle and insertion to help with needle-transducer alignment and visibility, (3) changes to ultrasound image formation, (4) motion-based analysis and (5) machine learning. Advantages, limitations and challenges of representative examples in each of the categories are discussed. Evaluation techniques performed in ex vivo, phantom and in vivo studies are discussed and summarized. Greatest limitation of the majority of the literature is that they rely on original visibility of the needle in the static image. Need for additional/improved apparatus is the greatest limitation toward clinical utility in practice. Ultrasound-guided needle placement is performed in many clinical applications, including biopsies, treatment injections and anesthesia. Despite the wide range and long history of this technique, an ongoing challenge is needle visibility in ultrasound. A robust technique to enhance ultrasonic needle visibility, especially for steeply inserted hand-held needles, and while maintaining clinical utility requirements is needed.","Beigi, Salcudean, Ng, Rohling","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02227-7","20200930","Image processing; Image-guidance; Machine learning; Needle detection; Needle visualization; Ultrasound","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16094,""
"Early-rectal Cancer Treatment: A Decision-tree Making Based on Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Local excision (LE) has arisen as an alternative to total mesorectal excision for the treatment of early rectal cancer. Despite a decreased morbidity, there are still concerns about LE outcomes. This systematic-review and meta-analysis design is based on the &quot;PICO&quot; process, aiming to answer to three questions related to LE as primary treatment for early-rectal cancer, the optimal method for LE, and the potential role for completion treatment in high-risk histology tumors and outcomes of salvage surgery. The results revealed that reported overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were 71%-91.7% and 80%-94% for LE, in contrast to 92.3%-94.3% and 94.4%-97% for radical surgery. Additional analysis of National Database studies revealed lower OS with LE (HR: 1.26; 95%CI, 1.09-1.45) and DSS (HR: 1.19; 95%CI, 1.01-1.41) after LE. Furthermore, patients receiving LE were significantly more prone develop local recurrence (RR: 3.44, 95%CI, 2.50-4.74). Analysis of available transanal surgical platforms was performed, finding no significant differences among them but reduced local recurrence compared to traditional transanal LE (OR:0.24;95%CI, 0.15-0.4). Finally, we found poor survival outcomes for patients undergoing salvage surgery, favoring completion treatment (chemoradiotherapy or surgery) when high-risk histology is present. In conclusion, LE could be considered adequate provided a full-thickness specimen can be achieved that the patient is informed about risk for potential requirement of completion treatment. Early-rectal cancer cases should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team, and patient's preferences must be considered in the decision-making process.","Aguirre-Allende, Enriquez-Navascues, Elorza-Echaniz, Etxart-Lopetegui, Borda-Arrizabalaga, Saralegui Ansorena, Placer-Galan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.05.035","20200930","AnÃƒÂ¡lisis de decisiones; CirugÃƒÂ­a completa; CirugÃƒÂ­a de rescate; CirugÃƒÂ­a radical; Completion radiotherapy; Completion surgery; CÃƒÂ¡ncer de recto inicial; Decision analysis; Early rectal cancer; EscisiÃƒÂ³n local; Local excision; Radical surgery; Radioterapia completa; RevisiÃƒÂ³n sistemÃƒÂ¡tica; Salvage surgery; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16095,""
"Using machine learning of clinical data to diagnose COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis","The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed severe stress on healthcare systems worldwide, which is amplified by the critical shortage of COVID-19 tests. In this study, we propose to generate a more accurate diagnosis model of COVID-19 based on patient symptoms and routine test results by applying machine learning to reanalyzing COVID-19 data from 151 published studies. We aim to investigate correlations between clinical variables, cluster COVID-19 patients into subtypes, and generate a computational classification model for discriminating between COVID-19 patients and influenza patients based on clinical variables alone. We discovered several novel associations between clinical variables, including correlations between being male and having higher levels of serum lymphocytes and neutrophils. We found that COVID-19 patients could be clustered into subtypes based on serum levels of immune cells, gender, and reported symptoms. Finally, we trained an XGBoost model to achieve a sensitivity of 92.5% and a specificity of 97.9% in discriminating COVID-19 patients from influenza patients. We demonstrated that computational methods trained on large clinical datasets could yield ever more accurate COVID-19 diagnostic models to mitigate the impact of lack of testing. We also presented previously unknown COVID-19 clinical variable correlations and clinical subgroups.","Li, Ma, Shende, Castaneda, Chakladar, Tsai, Apostol, Honda, Xu, Wong, Zhang, Lee, Gnanasekar, Honda, Kuo, Yu, Chang, Rajasekaran, Ongkeko","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-01266-z","20201013","COVID-19; Diagnostic model; Machine learning; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Computer Simulation; Coronavirus Infections; Datasets as Topic; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Influenza A virus; Influenza, Human; Machine Learning; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16096,""
"Pharmacokinetic Drug-drug Interaction of Antibiotics Used in Sepsis Care in China","Many antibiotics have a high potential for having an interaction with drugs, as perpetrator and/or victim, in critically ill patients, and particularly in sepsis patients. The aim of this review is to summarize the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction (DDI) of 45 antibiotics commonly used in sepsis care in China. Literature mining was conducted to obtain human pharmacokinetics/dispositions of the antibiotics, their interactions with drug metabolizing enzymes or transporters, and their associated clinical drug interactions. Potential DDI is indicated by a DDI index &gt; 0.1 for inhibition or a treated-cell/untreated-cell ratio of enzyme activity being &gt; 2 for induction. The literature-mined information on human pharmacokinetics of the identified antibiotics and their potential drug interactions is summarized. Antibiotic-perpetrated drug interactions, involving P450 enzyme inhibition, have been reported for four lipophilic antibacterials (ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and three lipophilic antifungals (fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole). In addition, seven hydrophilic antibacterials (ceftriaxone, cefamandole, piperacillin, penicillin G, amikacin, metronidazole, and linezolid) inhibit drug transporters in vitro. Despite no reported clinical PK drug interactions with the transporters, caution is advised in the use of these antibacterials. Eight hydrophilic antibacterials (all ÃŽÂ²-lactams; meropenem, cefotaxime, cefazolin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, penicillin G, ampicillin, and flucloxacillin), are potential victims of drug interactions due to transporter inhibition. Rifampin is reported to perpetrate drug interactions by inducing CYP3A or inhibiting OATP1B; it is also reported to be a victim of drug interactions, due to the dual inhibition of CYP3A4 and OATP1B by indinavir. In addition, three antifungals (caspofungin, itraconazole, and voriconazole) are reported to be victims of drug interactions because of P450 enzyme induction. Reports for other antibiotics acting as victims in drug interactions are scarce.","Yu, Chu, Li, He, Wang, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.2174/1389200221666200929115117","20200929","Pharmacokinetics; antibiotic; drug-drug interaction; enzyme ; sepsis; transporter","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16097,""
"Claims-Based Algorithms for Identifying Patients With Pulmonary Hypertension: A Comparison of Decision Rules and Machine-Learning Approaches","Background Real-world healthcare data are an important resource for epidemiologic research. However, accurate identification of patient cohorts-a crucial first step underpinning the validity of research results-remains a challenge. We developed and evaluated claims-based case ascertainment algorithms for pulmonary hypertension (PH), comparing conventional decision rules with state-of-the-art machine-learning approaches. Methods and Results We analyzed an electronic health record-Medicare linked database from two large academic tertiary care hospitals (years 2007-2013). Electronic health record charts were reviewed to form a gold standard cohort of patients with (n=386) and without PH (n=164). Using health encounter data captured in Medicare claims (including patients' demographics, diagnoses, medications, and procedures), we developed and compared 2 approaches for identifying patients with PH: decision rules and machine-learning algorithms using penalized lasso regression, random forest, and gradient boosting machine. The most optimal rule-based algorithm-having Ã¢â€°Â¥3 PH-related healthcare encounters and having undergone right heart catheterization-attained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.64 (sensitivity, 0.75; specificity, 0.48). All 3 machine-learning algorithms outperformed the most optimal rule-based algorithm (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). A model derived from the random forest algorithm achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (sensitivity, 0.87; specificity, 0.70), and gradient boosting machine achieved comparable results (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.85; sensitivity, 0.87; specificity, 0.70). Penalized lasso regression achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73 (sensitivity, 0.70; specificity, 0.68). Conclusions Research-grade case identification algorithms for PH can be derived and rigorously validated using machine-learning algorithms. Simple decision rules commonly applied in published literature performed poorly; more complex rule-based algorithms may potentially address the limitation of this approach. PH research using claims data would be considerably strengthened through the use of validated algorithms for cohort ascertainment.","Ong, Klann, Lin, Maron, Murphy, Natter, Mandl","https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.120.016648","20201006","computable phenotype; machine learning; pulmonary hypertension","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16098,""
"The cost-effectiveness of isavuconazole compared to voriconazole, the standard of care in the treatment of patients with invasive mould diseases, prior to differential pathogen diagnosis in Spain","Invasive mould diseases are associated with high morbidity, mortality and economic impact. Its treatment is often started prior to differential pathogen diagnosis. Isavuconazole is approved for treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IA) and invasive mucormycosis (IM) when amphotericin-B is not indicated. To estimate the cost-effectiveness of isavuconazole vs voriconazole for the treatment of adult patients with possible IA prior to differential pathogen diagnosis, in Spain. A decision tree analysis was performed using the Spanish Healthcare System perspective. Among all patients with possible IA, it was considered that 7.81% actually had IM. Costs for laboratory analysis, management of adverse events, hospitalisation and drugs per patient, deaths and long-term effects in life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) were considered. Efficacy data were obtained from clinical trials and utilities from the literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted. In patients with possible IA and when compared to voricanozole, isavuconazole showed an incremental cost of 4758.53Ã¢â€šÂ¬, besides an incremental effectiveness of +0.49 LYs and +0.41 QALYs per patient. The Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio was 9622.52Ã¢â€šÂ¬ per LY gained and 11,734.79Ã¢â€šÂ¬ per QALY gained. The higher cost of isavuconazole was due to drug acquisition. Main parameters influencing results were mortality, treatment duration and hospitalisation days. The PSA results showed that isavuconazole has a probability of being cost-effective of 67.34%, being dominant in 24.00% of cases. Isavuconazole is a cost-effective treatment compared to voriconazole for patients with possible IA for a willingness to pay threshold of 25,000Ã¢â€šÂ¬ per additional QALY.","Azanza, Grau, VÃƒÂ¡zquez, Rebollo, Peral, LÃƒÂ³pez-IbÃƒÂ¡ÃƒÂ±ez de Aldecoa, LÃƒÂ³pez-GÃƒÂ³mez","https://doi.org/10.1111/myc.13189","20201030","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16099,""

"Occupational noise-induced hearing loss in China: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Most of the Chinese occupational population are becoming at risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). However, there is a limited number of literature reviews on occupational NIHL in China. This study aimed to analyse the prevalence and characteristics of occupational NIHL in the Chinese population using data from relevant studies. Systematic review and meta-analysis. From December 2019 to February 2020, we searched the literature through databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, the China National Knowledge Internet, Chinese Sci-Tech Journal Database (weip.com), WanFang Database and China United Library Database, for studies on NIHL in China published in 1993-2019 and analysed the correlation between NIHL and occupational exposure to noise, including exposure to complex noise and coexposure to noise and chemicals. A total of 71 865 workers aged 33.5Ã‚Â±8.7 years were occupationally exposed to 98.6Ã‚Â±7.2 dB(A) (A-weighted decibels) noise for a duration of 9.9Ã‚Â±8.4 years in the transportation, mining and typical manufacturing industries. The prevalence of occupational NIHL in China was 21.3%, of which 30.2% was related to high-frequency NIHL (HFNIHL), 9.0% to speech-frequency NIHL and 5.8% to noise-induced deafness. Among manufacturing workers, complex noise contributed to greater HFNIHL than Gaussian noise (overall weighted OR (OR)=1.95). Coexposure to noise and chemicals such as organic solvents, welding fumes, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide led to greater HFNIHL than noise exposure alone (overall weighted OR=2.36). Male workers were more likely to experience HFNIHL than female workers (overall weighted OR=2.26). Age, noise level and exposure duration were also risk factors for HFNIHL (overall weighted OR=1.35, 5.63 and 1.75, respectively). The high prevalence of occupational NIHL in China was related to the wide distribution of noise in different industries as well as high-level and long-term noise exposure. The prevalence was further aggravated by exposure to complex noise or coexposure to noise and specific chemicals. Additional efforts are needed to reduce occupational noise exposure in China.","Zhou, Shi, Zhou, Hu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039576","20201028","health &amp; safety; occupational &amp; industrial medicine; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16101,""

"A systematic review of statistical models and outcomes of predicting fatal and serious injury crashes from driver crash and offense history data","Expenditure on driver-related behavioral interventions and road use policy is often justified by their impact on the frequency of fatal and serious injury crashes. Given the rarity of fatal and serious injury crashes, offense history, and crash history of drivers are sometimes used as an alternative measure of the impact of interventions and changes to policy. The primary purpose of this systematic review was to assess the rigor of statistical modeling used to predict fatal and serious crashes from offense history and crash history using a purpose-made quality assessment tool. A secondary purpose was to explore study outcomes. Only studies that used observational data and presented a statistical model of crash prediction from offense history or crash history were included. A quality assessment tool was developed for the systematic evaluation of statistical quality indicators across studies. The search was conducted in June 2019. One thousand one hundred and five unique records were identified, 252 full texts were screened for inclusion, resulting in 20 studies being included in the review. The results indicate substantial and important limitations in the modeling methods used. Most studies demonstrated poor statistical rigor ranging from low to middle quality. There was a lack of confidence in published findings due to poor variable selection, poor adherence to statistical assumptions relating to multicollinearity, and lack of validation using new data. It was concluded that future research should consider machine learning to overcome correlations in the data, use rigorous vetting procedures to identify predictor variables, and validate statistical models using new data to improve utility and generalizability of models.

"Pre-trained language model augmented adversarial training network for Chinese clinical event detection","Clinical event detection (CED) is a hot topic and essential task in medical artificial intelligence, which has attracted the attention from academia and industry over the recent years. However, most studies focus on English clinical narratives. Owing to the limitation of annotated Chinese medical corpus, there is a lack of relevant research about Chinese clinical narratives. The existing methods ignore the importance of contextual information in semantic understanding. Therefore, it is urgent to research multilingual clinical event detection. In this paper, we present a novel encoder-decoder structure based on pre-trained language model for Chinese CED task, which integrates contextual representations into Chinese character embeddings to assist model in semantic understanding. Compared with existing methods, our proposed strategy can help model harvest a language inferential skill. Besides, we introduce the punitive weight to adjust the proportion of loss on each category for coping with class imbalance problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct a range of experiments on test set of our manually annotated corpus. We compare overall performance of our proposed model with baseline models on our manually annotated corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves the best precision of 83.73%, recall of 86.56% and F1-score of 85.12%. Moreover, we also evaluate the performance of our proposed model with baseline models on minority category samples.

"Clinical data classification using an enhanced SMOTE and chaotic evolutionary feature selection","Class imbalance and the presence of irrelevant or redundant features in training data can pose serious challenges to the development of a classification framework. This paper proposes a framework for developing a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that addresses class imbalance and the feature selection problem. Under this framework, the dataset is balanced at the data level and a wrapper approach is used to perform feature selection. The following three clinical datasets from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository were used for experimentation: the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD), the Thoracic Surgery Dataset (TSD) and the Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) dataset. The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which was enhanced using Orchard's algorithm, was used to balance the datasets. A wrapper approach that uses Chaotic Multi-Verse Optimisation (CMVO) was proposed for feature subset selection. The arithmetic mean of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and F-score (F1), which was measured using a Random Forest (RF) classifier, was used as the fitness function. After selecting the relevant features, a RF, which comprises 100 estimators and uses the Information Gain Ratio as the split criteria, was used for classification. The classifier achieved a 0.65 MCC, a 0.84 F1 and 82.46% accuracy for the ILPD; a 0.74 MCC, a 0.87 F1 and 86.88% accuracy for the TSD; and a 0.78 MCC, a 0.89 F1and 89.04% accuracy for the PID dataset. The effects of balancing and feature selection on the classifier were investigated and the performance of the framework was compared with the existing works in the literature. The results showed that the proposed framework is competitive in terms of the three performance measures used. The results of a Wilcoxon test confirmed the statistical superiority of the proposed method.","Sreejith, Khanna Nehemiah, Kannan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103991","20201102","Chaotic maps; Class imbalance; Classification; Clinical decision support system; Feature selection; Multi Verse Optimisation; SMOTE","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16105,""

"Interprofessional versus uniprofessional dyad learning for medical students in a clinical setting","The aim of the present study was to explore and compare medical students' perceived learning outcomes when treating patients under supervision in two different learning settings: a uniprofessional or an interprofessional dyad. The design of the study is a qualitative interview study. Data were collected from October 2016 to June 2017 via semi-structured group interviews performed at the end of the clinical placement in an orthopaedic outpatient clinic for medical students in the last semester of the curriculum. In the placement, the students worked by turns in either a uniprofessional dyad with two medical students or an interprofessional dyad with a nursing student. The data from the interviews were analysed using Systematic Text Analysis. Overall, 21 students were interviewed. The students appreciated the authenticity of dealing with real patient problems. Both dyads provided the possibility of working as a professional, but the interprofessional dyad had a more authentic setting. In both dyads, the students' interdependence and mutual support promoted the acquisition of knowledge and skills. Working in the interprofessional dyad facilitated relationships between the professions, and the medical students became aware of some of their own profession's strengths and weaknesses. The interprofessional collaboration contributed to different perspectives on the patients' course of treatment and led to a more holistic understanding of the treatment. Interprofessional dyads have the potential to improve learning outcomes in the clinical training of medical students. Further studies are needed to explore the benefits across medical specialities and settings.","Hansen, Pape, Thiesen, Jakobsen","https://doi.org/10.5116/ijme.5f50.bc76","20201001","clinical learning; dyad; indirect supervision; interprofessional; uniprofessional","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16107,""

"Application of artificial intelligence models and optimization algorithms in plant cell and tissue culture","Artificial intelligence (AI) models and optimization algorithms (OA) are broadly employed in different fields of technology and science and have recently been applied to improve different stages of plant tissue culture. The usefulness of the application of AI-OA has been demonstrated in the prediction and optimization of length and number of microshoots or roots, biomass in plant cell cultures or hairy root culture, and optimization of environmental conditions to achieve maximum productivity and efficiency, as well as classification of microshoots and somatic embryos. Despite its potential, the use of AI and OA in this field has been limited due to complex definition terms and computational algorithms. Therefore, a systematic review to unravel modeling and optimizing methods is important for plant researchers and has been acknowledged in this study. First, the main steps for AI-OA development (from data selection to evaluation of prediction and classification models), as well as several AI models such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), neurofuzzy logic, support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, random forest (FR), and genetic algorithms (GA), have been represented. Then, the application of AI-OA models in different steps of plant tissue culture has been discussed and highlighted. This review also points out limitations in the application of AI-OA in different plant tissue culture processes and provides a new view for future study objectives. KEY POINTS: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Artificial intelligence models and optimization algorithms can be considered a novel and reliable computational method in plant tissue culture.

"A machine learning-based clinical decision support system to identify prescriptions with a high risk of medication error","To improve patient safety and clinical outcomes by reducing the risk of prescribing errors, we tested the accuracy of a hybrid clinical decision support system in prioritizing prescription checks. Data from electronic health records were collated over a period of 18 months. Inferred scores at a patient level (probability of a patient's set of active orders to require a pharmacist review) were calculated using a hybrid approach (machine learning and a rule-based expert system). A clinical pharmacist analyzed randomly selected prescription orders over a 2-week period to corroborate our findings. Predicted scores were compared with the pharmacist's review using the area under the receiving-operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve. These metrics were compared with existing tools: computerized alerts generated by a clinical decision support (CDS) system and a literature-based multicriteria query prioritization technique. Data from 10Ã‚Â 716 individual patients (133Ã‚Â 179 prescription orders) were used to train the algorithm on the basis of 25 features in a development dataset. While the pharmacist analyzed 412 individual patients (3364 prescription orders) in an independent validation dataset, the areas under the receiving-operating characteristic and precision-recall curves of our digital system were 0.81 and 0.75, respectively, thus demonstrating greater accuracy than the CDS system (0.65 and 0.56, respectively) and multicriteria query techniques (0.68 and 0.56, respectively). Our innovative digital tool was notably more accurate than existing techniques (CDS system and multicriteria query) at intercepting potential prescription errors. By primarily targeting high-risk patients, this novel hybrid decision support system improved the accuracy and reliability of prescription checks in a hospital setting.","Corny, Rajkumar, Martin, Dode, LajonchÃƒÂ¨re, Billuart, BÃƒÂ©zie, Buronfosse","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa154","20200928","clinical; clinical pharmacy information systems; decision support systems; electronic prescribing; medication errors; supervised machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16110,""

We searched relevant literature in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using specific keywords, e.g., &quot;COVID-19 pandemic,&quot; &quot;preclinical medical education,&quot; &quot;online learning,&quot; &quot;remote learning,&quot; &quot;challenges,&quot; and &quot;opportunities.&quot; The pandemic has posed several challenges to premedical education (e.g., suspension of face-to-face teaching, lack of cadaveric dissections, and practical/laboratory sessions) but has provided many opportunities as well, such as the incorporation of online learning in the curriculum and upskilling and reskilling in new technologies. To date, many medical schools have successfully transitioned their educational environment to emergency remote teaching and assessments. During COVID-19 crisis, the preclinical phase of medical curricula has successfully introduced the novel culture of &quot;online home learning&quot; using technology-oriented innovations, which may extend to post-COVID era to maintain teaching and learning in medical education. However, the lack of hands-on training in the preclinical years may have serious implications on the training of the current cohort of students, and they may struggle later in the clinical years. The use of emergent technology (e.g., artificial intelligence for adaptive learning, virtual simulation, and telehealth) for education is most likely to be indispensable components of the transformative change and post-COVID medical education.","Gaur, Majumder, Sa, Sarkar, Williams, Singh","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42399-020-00528-1","20201001","COVID-19 pandemic; Challenges; Online learning; Opportunities; Preclinical medical education; Remote learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16111,""
"Named Entity Recognition and Relation Detection for Biomedical Information Extraction","The number of scientific publications in the literature is steadily growing, containing our knowledge in the biomedical, health, and clinical sciences. Since there is currently no automatic archiving of the obtained results, much of this information remains buried in textual details not readily available for further usage or analysis. For this reason, natural language processing (NLP) and text mining methods are used for information extraction from such publications. In this paper, we review practices for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Detection (RD), allowing, e.g., to identify interactions between proteins and drugs or genes and diseases. This information can be integrated into networks to summarize large-scale details on a particular biomedical or clinical problem, which is then amenable for easy data management and further analysis. Furthermore, we survey novel deep learning methods that have recently been introduced for such tasks.","Perera, Dehmer, Emmert-Streib","https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2020.00673","20201001","artificial intelligence; deep learning; information extraction; named entity recognition; natural language processing; relation detection; text analytics; text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16112,""
"A systematic review of online examinations: A pedagogical innovation for scalable authentication and integrity","Digitization and automation across all industries has resulted in improvements in efficiencies and effectiveness to systems and process, and the higher education sector is not immune. Online learning, e-learning, electronic teaching tools, and digital assessments are not innovations. However, there has been limited implementation of online invigilated examinations in many countries. This paper provides a brief background on online examinations, followed by the results of a systematic review on the topic to explore the challenges and opportunities. We follow on with an explication of results from thirty-six papers, exploring nine key themes: student perceptions, student performance, anxiety, cheating, staff perceptions, authentication and security, interface design, and technology issues. While the literature on online examinations is growing, there is still a dearth of discussion at the pedagogical and governance levels.","Butler-Henderson, Crawford","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2020.104024","20201022","Adult learning applications; Architectures for educational technology system; Human-computer interface; Pedagogical issues","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16113,""

"Systematic review of sarcomas radiomics studies: Bridging the gap between concepts and clinical applications?","Sarcomas are a model for intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneities making them particularly suitable for radiomics analyses. Our purposes were to review the aims, methods and results of radiomics studies involving sarcomas METHODS: Pubmed and Web of Sciences databases were searched for radiomics or textural studies involving bone, soft-tissues and visceral sarcomas until June 2020. Two radiologists evaluated their objectives, results and quality of their methods, imaging pre-processing and machine-learning workflow helped by the items of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2), Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) and 'Radiomics Quality Score' (RQS). Statistical analyses included inter-reader agreements, correlations between methodological assessments, scientometrics indices, and their changes over years, and between RQS, number of patients and models performance. Fifty-two studies were included involving: soft-tissue sarcomas (29/52, 55.8 %), bone sarcomas (15/52, 28.8 %), gynecological sarcomas (6/52, 11.5 %) and mixed sarcomas (2/52, 3.8 %), mostly imaged with MRI (36/52, 69.2 %), for a total of distinct patients. Median RQS was 4.5 (28.4 % of the maximum, range: -7 - 17). Performances of predictive models and number of patients negatively correlated (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.027). None of the studies detailed all the items from the IBSI guidelines. There was a significant increase in studies' impact factors since the establishing of the RQS in 2017 (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.038). Although showing promising results, further efforts are needed to make sarcoma radiomics studies reproducible with an acceptable level of evidence. A better knowledge of the RQS and IBSI reporting guidelines could improve the quality of sarcoma radiomics studies and accelerate clinical applications.","CrombÃƒÂ©, Fadli, Italiano, Saut, Buy, Kind","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109283","20201028","Machine learning; Magnetic resonance imaging; Quality improvement; Radiomics; Sarcoma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16115,""
"Advanced vehicle technologies and road safety: A scoping review of the evidence","The proliferation of Advanced Vehicle Technologies (AVTs) has generated both excitement and concern among researchers, policymakers, and the general public. An increasing number of driver assistance systems are already available in today's automobiles; many of which are expected to become standard. Therefore, synthesizing the available evidence specific to the safety of AVTs is critical. The goal of this scoping review was to summarize this evidence with a focus on AVTs that require some driver oversight (i.e., Levels 0-3 as per the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) levels of automation taxonomy). A scoping review of research literature on AVTs was conducted for studies up to March 2018. Inclusion criteria consisted of: any study with empirical data of AVTs that included male and female drivers aged 16 years and older, healthy people (i.e., without impairments), passenger vehicles, driving simulators and/or large databases with road safety information that could be analyzed for the purpose of examining AVTs (SAE Levels 0-3), as well as measures of driving outcomes. A total of 324 peer-reviewed studies from 25 countries met the inclusion criteria for this review with over half published in the last 5 years. Data was extracted and summarized according to the following categories: measures used to evaluate the effect of AVTs on road safety (objective) and driver perceptions of the technology (subjective), testing environment, and study populations (i.e., driver age). The most commonly reported objective measures were longitudinal control (50 %), reaction time (40 %), and lateral position (23 %). The most common subjective measures were perceptions of trust (27 %), workload (20 %), and satisfaction (17 %). While most studies investigated singular AVTs (237 of 324 studies), the number of studies after 2013 that examined 2 or more AVTs concurrently increased. Studies involved drivers from different age groups (51 %) and were conducted in driving simulators (70 %). Overall, the evidence is generally in favour of AVTs having a positive effect on driving safety, although the nature and design of studies varied widely. Our examination of this evidence highlights the opportunities as well as the challenges involved with investigating AVTs. Ensuring such technologies are congruent with the needs of drivers, particularly younger and older driver age groups, who are known to have a higher crash risk, is critical. With automotive manufacturers keen to adopt the latest AVTs, this scoping review highlights how testing of this technology has been undertaken, with a focus on how new research can be conducted to improve road safety now and in the future.","Furlan, Kajaks, Tiong, LavalliÃƒÂ¨re, Campos, Babineau, Haghzare, Ma, Vrkljan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2020.105741","20201013","Advanced driver assistance systems; Advanced vehicle technologies; Age; Drivers; Driving","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16116,""
"Artificial intelligence in celiac disease","Celiac disease (CD) has been on the rise in the world and a large part of it remains undiagnosed. Novel methods are required to address the gaps in prompt detection and management. Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen an exponential surge in the last decade worldwide. With the advent of big data and powerful computational ability, we now have self-driving cars and smart devices in our daily lives. Huge databases in the form of electronic medical records and images have rendered healthcare a lucrative sector where AI can prove revolutionary. It is being used extensively to overcome the barriers in clinical workflows. From the perspective of a disease, it can be deployed in multiple steps i.e. screening tools, diagnosis, developing novel therapeutic agents, proposing management plans, and defining prognostic indicators, etc. We review the areas where it may augment physicians in the delivery of better healthcare by summarizing current literature on the use of AI in healthcare using CD as a model. We further outline major barriers to its large-scale implementations and prospects from the healthcare point of view.","Sana, Hussain, Shah, Maqsood","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103996","20201027","Artificial intelligence; Celiac disease; Deep learning; Machine learning; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16117,""
"Classifyber, a robust streamline-based linear classifier for white matter bundle segmentation","Virtual delineation of white matter bundles in the human brain is of paramount importance for multiple applications, such as pre-surgical planning and connectomics. A substantial body of literature is related to methods that automatically segment bundles from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) data indirectly, by exploiting either the idea of connectivity between regions or the geometry of fiber paths obtained with tractography techniques, or, directly, through the information in volumetric data. Despite the remarkable improvement in automatic segmentation methods over the years, their segmentation quality is not yet satisfactory, especially when dealing with datasets with very diverse characteristics, such as different tracking methods, bundle sizes or data quality. In this work, we propose a novel, supervised streamline-based segmentation method, called Classifyber, which combines information from atlases, connectivity patterns, and the geometry of fiber paths into a simple linear model. With a wide range of experiments on multiple datasets that span from research to clinical domains, we show that Classifyber substantially improves the quality of segmentation as compared to other state-of-the-art methods and, more importantly, that it is robust across very diverse settings. We provide an implementation of the proposed method as open source code, as well as web service.","BertÃƒÂ², Bullock, Astolfi, Hayashi, Zigiotto, Annicchiarico, Corsini, De Benedictis, Sarubbo, Pestilli, Avesani, Olivetti","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117402","20201030","Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI); Linear classification; Supervised learning; White matter bundle segmentation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16118,""
"How can children be involved in developing oral health education interventions?","This review examined the oral health interventions that have been developed for elementary school age children and the involvement of children in these intervention studies. Eight randomised controlled trials involving 3,232 children were analysed using deductive content analysis by two authors. Child involvement was categorised using the Typology of Youth Participation and Empowerment TYPE model. In all eight studies, the interventions were designed by the researchers and adult-led without involvement of children. Further studies with participatory research methodology are recommended to better understand the role of involvement of children in oral health education.Data sources The data search was carried out in April 2018 using PubMed, CINAHL, Embase and Scopus databases. The search focused on elementary age school children (6-12 years) who were involved in oral health education intervention studies. Exclusion criteria were studies involving children with mental or physical impairment, undergoing hospital or orthodontic treatment, preventative treatments or solely targeted towards parents/caregivers or teachers.Study selection A systematic review method of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was selected. Titles and abstracts were included or excluded before full text analysis for eligibility was carried out. Studies were assessed by two authors with a third author to be consulted in cases of disagreement.Data extraction and synthesis Study sample, intervention duration and content, selection, use of educational methods including use of a theoretical framework and outcomes were extracted from the data. Child involvement was categorised using the Typology of Youth Participation and Empowerment (TYPE) pyramid (Wong et al., 2010).<sup>1</sup> The quality of studies was assessed using the CONSORT checklist and the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The methodological quality of the studies was relatively low with a score of 14-22 out of 36. Three studies were rated as being fair quality in terms of risk of bias. The remaining five were rated as either unclear or high risk of bias.Results Eight RCTs were selected for review. Sixty-five articles were assessed for eligibility and 57 articles were excluded due to non-RCT design, excluded/unreported ages and full text unavailability. Nine different methods of oral health education were identified: lecture; printed material; demonstration; toothbrushing diary; game; video; workshop; discussion; and oral hygiene training. None of the reported studies demonstrated a rationale for selecting their educational method. Four reports described a theoretical framework for development their intervention: social learning theory (Parcel and Baranowski, 1981) was used by Haleem et al. (2012); Health Belief Model (Becker, 1974) by Yekaninejad et al. (2012), Wolf's health learning capacity (2009) by Freeman et al. (2016) and Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour (1991) by Simpriano and Mialhe (2017). However, the use of these theories was limited and no attempts to introduce children's perspectives into the theoretical framework was identified.Five outcomes to measure effectiveness were found: clinical oral health status; oral health-related behaviour; oral health knowledge; attitudes towards oral health; and oral health related quality of life. Clinical oral health status was the most commonly used outcome (seven of the eight studies). Positive outcomes were found in all eight studies. None of the reports considered the potential for enhancing intervention effects by involving children more actively. The children's role in the interventions was mostly the Vessel type of participation from the TYPE pyramid model. Partially symbolic participation was detected in two studies - Haleem et al. (2012) trained children to conduct oral health education in the role of peer educators and Simpriano and Mialhe (2017) trained children to create their own plans for daily toothbrushing and how to overcome situations preventing that task. There were no reports of consultation or collaboration with children for their perspectives before or after the interventions. Interventions appear to have been created by the researchers alone.Conclusions In all of the included studies, children were only involved during the intervention implementation phase. The interventions were all adult designed and adult led. Lack of detail in the reports meant that reported positive outcomes could not be clearly attributed to the activities carried out by the children. Further studies with participatory research methodology are recommended to better understand the potential role of children in oral health education and research.","Quach","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41432-020-0122-6","20201005","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Health Education, Dental; Humans; Oral Health; Oral Hygiene; Quality of Life; Schools","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16119,""
"Does personalised text messaging influence patients' caries risk?","Design A single-blinded, randomised controlled trial. The experimental group received 24 personalised text messages each week, disseminating tailored preventive advice using the multifactorial model for individual caries risk assessment: Cariogram. The same frequency of text messaging was delivered to the control group; however, these were non-personalised messages and did not factor the Cariogram.Sample selection One hundred and ninety-one participants were assessed for eligibility by eight calibrated, volunteer dental practitioners in County Cork, Ireland. Six different inclusion criteria were detailed, including the requirement for medical card holders, serving as an indicator for economically underprivileged status. Other criteria included: aged between 19-70 years; competent with text messaging services; have a minimum of 20 teeth present; not pregnant; and prepared to give consent. Failure to return a baseline food diary or possess a mobile phone saw the exclusion of 20 participants. Following stratified and blocked randomisation, 85 and 86 participants were allocated in the test and control group, respectively. The study received ethical approval by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals.Data analysis One hundred and eleven participants attended the follow-up examination, 26 weeks after randomisation, where the 'chance of avoiding new cavities' was determined as a numerical index for caries risk. The secondary aim was to measure individual changes to seven Cariogram risk factors between the baseline assessment and the re-examination. The ANCOVA intention-to-threat (ITT) protocol and the per-protocol method were adhered to for analyses of outcome measures. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.4, in adherence to a pre-defined significance level of 5% (two-sided).Results Both analytic techniques confirmed no statistically significant difference (p &gt;0.05) between the groups regarding the 'chance of avoiding new cavities'. Of the risk parameters assessed, only saliva secretion demonstrated a positive effect in the intervention group (p = 0.036, OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1, 0.9). Predictive modelling techniques were not reliable due to the limited sample size of per-protocol analysis.Conclusions The failure to conclude statistical significance between the groups validates the null hypothesis. Accordingly, no difference can be established between the personalised nor non-personalised mobile text messaging intervention on the caries risk of underprivileged adults in Ireland. The authors address the value of further studies exploring the potential for caries risk reduction through mobile phone communications.","Patel","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41432-020-0109-3","20201002","Adult; Aged; Cell Phone; Dental Caries; Dentists; Female; Humans; Ireland; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Professional Role; Single-Blind Method; Text Messaging; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16120,""

"Preventing the transmission of COVID-19 and other coronaviruses in older adults aged 60Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and above living in long-term care: a rapid review","The objective of this review was to examine the current guidelines for infection prevention and control (IPAC) of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) or other coronaviruses in adults 60Ã¢â‚¬â€°years or older living in long-term care facilities (LTCF). EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane library, pre-print servers, clinical trial registries, and relevant grey literature sources were searched until July 31, 2020, using database searching and an automated method called Continuous Active LearningÃ‚Â® (CALÃ‚Â®). All search results were processed using CALÃ‚Â® to identify the most likely relevant citations that were then screened by a single human reviewer. Full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal were completed by a single reviewer and verified by a second. Nine clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were included. The most common recommendation in the CPGs was establishing surveillance and monitoring systems followed by mandating the use of PPE; physically distancing or cohorting residents; environmental cleaning and disinfection; promoting hand and respiratory hygiene among residents, staff, and visitors; and providing sick leave compensation for staff. Current evidence suggests robust surveillance and monitoring along with support for IPAC initiatives are key to preventing the spread of COVID-19 in LTCF. However, there are significant gaps in the current recommendations especially with regard to the movement of staff between LTCF and their role as possible transmission vectors.

"Safety and accuracy of robot-assisted placement of pedicle screws compared to conventional free-hand technique: a systematic review and meta-analysis","The introduction and integration of robot technology into modern spine surgery provides surgeons with millimeter accuracy for pedicle screw placement. Coupled with computer-based navigation platforms, robot-assisted spine surgery utilizes augmented reality to potentially improve the safety profile of instrumentation. In this study, the authors seek to determine the safety and efficacy of robotic-assisted pedicle screw placement compared to conventional free-hand (FH) technique. We conducted a systematic review of the electronic databases using different MeSH terms from 1980 to 2020. The present study measures pedicle screw accuracy, complication rates, proximal-facet joint violation, intraoperative radiation time, radiation dosage, and length of surgery. A total of 1,525 patients (7,379 pedicle screws) from 19 studies with 777 patients (51.0% with 3,684 pedicle screws) in the robotic-assisted group were included. Perfect pedicle screw accuracy, as categorized by Gerztbein-Robbin Grade A, was significantly superior with robotic-assisted surgery compared to FH-technique (Odds ratio [OR]: 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-2.35; p=.003). Similarly, clinically acceptable pedicle screw accuracy (Grade A+B) was significantly higher with robotic-assisted surgery versus FH-technique (OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.01-2.37; p=.05). Furthermore, the complication rates and proximal-facet joint violation were 69% (OR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.20-0.48; p&lt;.00001) and 92% less likely (OR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.03-0.20; p&lt;.00001) with robotic-assisted surgery versus FH-group. Robotic-assisted pedicle screw implantation significantly reduced intraoperative radiation time (MD: -5.30, 95% CI: -6.83-3.76; p&lt;.00001) and radiation dosage (MD: -3.70, 95% CI: -4.80-2.60; p&lt;.00001) compared to the conventional FH-group. However, the length of surgery was significantly higher with robotic-assisted surgery (MD: 22.70, 95% CI: 6.57-38.83; p=.006) compared to the FH-group. This meta-analysis corroborates the accuracy of robot-assisted pedicle screw placement.","Fatima, Massaad, Hadzipasic, Shankar, Shin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spinee.2020.09.007","20201007","Artificial intelligence; Augmented realit; Efficacy; Pedicle screw; Robotics; Safety; Spine fusion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16123,""
"One Algorithm May Not Fit All: How Selection Bias Affects Machine Learning Performance","Machine learning (ML) algorithms have demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in identifying and categorizing disease on radiologic images. Despite the results of initial research studies that report ML algorithm diagnostic accuracy similar to or exceeding that of radiologists, the results are less impressive when the algorithms are installed at new hospitals and are presented with new images. This phenomenon is potentially the result of selection bias in the data that were used to develop the ML algorithm. Selection bias has long been described by clinical epidemiologists as a key consideration when designing a clinical research study, but this concept has largely been unaddressed in the medical imaging ML literature. The authors discuss the importance of selection bias and its relevance to ML algorithm development to prepare the radiologist to critically evaluate ML literature for potential selection bias and understand how it might affect the applicability of ML algorithms in real clinical environments. <sup>Ã‚Â©</sup>RSNA, 2020.","Yu, Eng","https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.2020200040","20200925","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16124,""
"The Role of Machine Learning in Spine Surgery: The Future Is Now","The recent influx of machine learning centered investigations in the spine surgery literature has led to increased enthusiasm as to the prospect of using artificial intelligence to create clinical decision support tools, optimize postoperative outcomes, and improve technologies used in the operating room. However, the methodology underlying machine learning in spine research is often overlooked as the subject matter is quite novel and may be foreign to practicing spine surgeons. Improper application of machine learning is a significant bioethics challenge, given the potential consequences of over- or underestimating the results of such studies for clinical decision-making processes. Proper peer review of these publications requires a baseline familiarity of the language associated with machine learning, and how it differs from classical statistical analyses. This narrative review first introduces the overall field of machine learning and its role in artificial intelligence, and defines basic terminology. In addition, common modalities for applying machine learning, including classification and regression decision trees, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks are examined in the context of examples gathered from the spine literature. Lastly, the ethical challenges associated with adapting machine learning for research related to patient care, as well as future perspectives on the potential use of machine learning in spine surgery, are discussed specifically.","Chang, Canseco, Nicholson, Patel, Vaccaro","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsurg.2020.00054","20200928","artificial intelligence; deep learning; machine learning; orthopedic surgery; spine surgery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16125,""
"A proteomic repertoire of autoantigens identified from the classic autoantibody clinical test substrate HEp-2 cells","Autoantibodies are a hallmark of autoimmune diseases. Autoantibody screening by indirect immunofluorescence staining of HEp-2 cells with patient sera is a current standard in clinical practice. Differential diagnosis of autoimmune disorders is based on commonly recognizable nuclear and cytoplasmic staining patterns. In this study, we attempted to identify as many autoantigens as possible from HEp-2 cells using a unique proteomic DS-affinity enrichment strategy. HEp-2 cells were cultured and lysed. Total proteins were extracted from cell lysate and fractionated with DS-Sepharose resins. Proteins were eluted with salt gradients, and fractions with low to high affinity were collected and sequenced by mass spectrometry. Literature text mining was conducted to verify the autoantigenicity of each protein. Protein interaction network and pathway analyses were performed on all identified proteins. This study identified 107 proteins from fractions with low to high DS-affinity. Of these, 78 are verified autoantigens with previous reports as targets of autoantibodies, whereas 29 might be potential autoantigens yet to be verified. Among the 107 proteins, 82 can be located to nucleus and 15 to the mitotic cell cycle, which may correspond to the dominance of nuclear and mitotic staining patterns in HEp-2 test. There are 55 vesicle-associated proteins and 12 ribonucleoprotein granule proteins, which may contribute to the diverse speckled patterns in HEp-2 stains. There are also 32 proteins related to the cytoskeleton. Protein network analysis indicates that these proteins have significantly more interactions among themselves than would be expected of a random set, with the top 3 networks being mRNA metabolic process regulation, apoptosis, and DNA conformation change. This study provides a proteomic repertoire of confirmed and potential autoantigens for future studies, and the findings are consistent with a mechanism for autoantigenicity: how self-molecules may form molecular complexes with DS to elicit autoimmunity. Our data contribute to the molecular etiology of autoimmunity and may deepen our understanding of autoimmune diseases.","Wang, Zhang, Rho, Roehrl, Roehrl","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12014-020-09298-3","20200928","ANA test; Antinuclear autoantibody; Autoantibody; Autoantibody test; Autoantigen; Dermatan sulfate; HEp-2 cell","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16126,""
"2D and 3D convolutional neural networks for outcome modelling of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma","For treatment individualisation of patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with primary radiochemotherapy, we explored the capabilities of different deep learning approaches for predicting loco-regional tumour control (LRC) from treatment-planning computed tomography images. Based on multicentre cohorts for exploration (206 patients) and independent validation (85 patients), multiple deep learning strategies including training of 3D- and 2D-convolutional neural networks (CNN) from scratch, transfer learning and extraction of deep autoencoder features were assessed and compared to a clinical model. Analyses were based on Cox proportional hazards regression and model performances were assessed by the concordance index (C-index) and the model's ability to stratify patients based on predicted hazards of LRC. Among all models, an ensemble of 3D-CNNs achieved the best performance (C-index 0.31) with a significant association to LRC on the independent validation cohort. It performed better than the clinical model including the tumour volume (C-index 0.39). Significant differences in LRC were observed between patient groups at low or high risk of tumour recurrence as predicted by the model ([Formula: see text]). This 3D-CNN ensemble will be further evaluated in a currently ongoing prospective validation study once follow-up is complete.","Starke, Leger, Zwanenburg, Leger, Lohaus, Linge, Schreiber, Kalinauskaite, Tinhofer, Guberina, Guberina, Balermpas, von der GrÃƒÂ¼n, Ganswindt, Belka, Peeken, Combs, Boeke, Zips, Richter, Troost, Krause, Baumann, LÃƒÂ¶ck","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70542-9","20201029","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16127,""
"EBM+: Advancing Evidence-Based Medicine via two level automatic identification of Populations, Interventions, Outcomes in medical literature","Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) has been an important practice for medical practitioners. However, as the number of medical publications increases dramatically, it is becoming extremely difficult for medical experts to review all the contents available and make an informative treatment plan for their patients. A variety of frameworks, including the PICO framework which is named after its elements (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome), have been developed to enable fine-grained searches, as the first step to faster decision making. In this work, we propose a novel entity recognition system that identifies PICO entities within medical publications and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the task. This is achieved by the combination of four 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for character feature extraction, and a Highway Residual connection to facilitate deep Neural Network architectures. We further introduce a PICO Statement classifier, that identifies sentences that not only contain all PICO entities but also answer questions stated in PICO. To facilitate this task we also introduce a high quality dataset, manually annotated by medical practitioners. With the combination of our proposed PICO Entity Recognizer and PICO Statement classifier we aim to advance EBM and enable its faster and more accurate practice.","Stylianou, Razis, Goulis, Vlahavas","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101949","20201023","Evidence Based Medicine; Machine learning; Natural Language Processing; Neural networks; PICO","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16128,""
"Automated ICD-10 code assignment of nonstandard diagnoses via a two-stage framework","An electronic medical record (EMR) is a rich source of clinical information for medical studies. Each physician usually has his or her own way to describe a patient's diagnosis. This results in many different ways to describe the same disease, which produces a large number of informal nonstandard diagnoses in EMRs. The Tenth Revision of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) is a medical classification list of codes for diagnoses. Automated ICD-10 code assignment of the nonstandard diagnosis is an important way to improve the quality of the medical study. However, manual coding is expensive, time-consuming and inefficient. Moreover, terminology in the standard diagnostic library comprises approximately 23,000 subcategory (6-digit) codes. Classifying the entire set of subcategory codes is extremely challenging. ICD-10 codes in the standard diagnostic library are organized hierarchically, and each category code (3-digit) relates to several or dozens of subcategory (6-digit) codes. Based on the hierarchical structure of the ICD-10 code, we propose a two-stage ICD-10 code assignment framework, which examines the entire category codes (approximately 1900) and searches the subcategory codes under the specific category code. Furthermore, since medical coding datasets are plagued with a training data sparsity issue, we introduce more supervised information to overcome this issue. Compared with the method that searches within approximately 23,000 subcategory codes, our approach requires examination of a considerably reduced number of codes. Extensive experiments show that our framework can improve the performance of the automated code assignment.","Mou, Ren","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101939","20201023","Automated ICD-10 code assignment; Text-matching; Two-stage framework","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16129,""
"Deep learning to find colorectal polyps in colonoscopy: A systematic literature review","Colorectal cancer has a great incidence rate worldwide, but its early detection significantly increases the survival rate. Colonoscopy is the gold standard procedure for diagnosis and removal of colorectal lesions with potential to evolve into cancer and computer-aided detection systems can help gastroenterologists to increase the adenoma detection rate, one of the main indicators for colonoscopy quality and predictor for colorectal cancer prevention. The recent success of deep learning approaches in computer vision has also reached this field and has boosted the number of proposed methods for polyp detection, localization and segmentation. Through a systematic search, 35 works have been retrieved. The current systematic review provides an analysis of these methods, stating advantages and disadvantages for the different categories used; comments seven publicly available datasets of colonoscopy images; analyses the metrics used for reporting and identifies future challenges and recommendations. Convolutional neural networks are the most used architecture together with an important presence of data augmentation strategies, mainly based on image transformations and the use of patches. End-to-end methods are preferred over hybrid methods, with a rising tendency. As for detection and localization tasks, the most used metric for reporting is the recall, while Intersection over Union is highly used in segmentation. One of the major concerns is the difficulty for a fair comparison and reproducibility of methods. Even despite the organization of challenges, there is still a need for a common validation framework based on a large, annotated and publicly available database, which also includes the most convenient metrics to report results. Finally, it is also important to highlight that efforts should be focused in the future on proving the clinical value of the deep learning based methods, by increasing the adenoma detection rate.","SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Peralta, Bote-Curiel, PicÃƒÂ³n, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Margallo, Pagador","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101923","20201023","Colorectal cancer; Deep learning; Detection; Localization; Segmentation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16130,""
"Diagnosis of Rare Diseases: a scoping review of clinical decision support systems","Rare Diseases (RDs), which are defined as diseases affecting no more than 5 out of 10,000 people, are often severe, chronic and life-threatening. A main problem is the delay in diagnosing RDs. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) for RDs are software systems to support clinicians in the diagnosis of patients with RDs. Due to their clinical importance, we conducted a scoping review to determine which CDSSs are available to support the diagnosis of RDs patients, whether the CDSSs are available to be used by clinicians and which functionalities and data are used to provide decision support. We searched PubMed for CDSSs in RDs published between December 16, 2008 and December 16, 2018. Only English articles, original peer reviewed journals and conference papers describing a clinical prototype or a routine use of CDSSs were included. For data charting, we used the data items &quot;Objective and background of the publication/project&quot;, &quot;System or project name&quot;, &quot;Functionality&quot;, &quot;Type of clinical data&quot;, &quot;Rare Diseases covered&quot;, &quot;Development status&quot;, &quot;System availability&quot;, &quot;Data entry and integration&quot;, &quot;Last software update&quot; and &quot;Clinical usage&quot;. The search identified 636 articles. After title and abstracting screening, as well as assessing the eligibility criteria for full-text screening, 22 articles describing 19 different CDSSs were identified. Three types of CDSSs were classified: &quot;Analysis or comparison of genetic and phenotypic data,&quot; &quot;machine learning&quot; and &quot;information retrieval&quot;. Twelve of nineteen CDSSs use phenotypic and genetic data, followed by clinical data, literature databases and patient questionnaires. Fourteen of nineteen CDSSs are fully developed systems and therefore publicly available. Data can be entered or uploaded manually in six CDSSs, whereas for four CDSSs no information for data integration was available. Only seven CDSSs allow further ways of data integration. thirteen CDSS do not provide information about clinical usage. Different CDSS for various purposes are available, yet clinicians have to determine which is best for their patient. To allow a more precise usage, future research has to focus on CDSSs RDs data integration, clinical usage and updating clinical knowledge. It remains interesting which of the CDSSs will be used and maintained in the future.","Schaaf, Sedlmayr, Schaefer, Storf","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-020-01536-z","20201001","Clinical decision support systems; Computer-assisted diagnosis; Rare diseases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16131,""
"Supporting topic modeling and trends analysis in biomedical literature","Topic modeling refers to a suite of probabilistic algorithms for extracting popular topics from a collection of documents. A common approach involves the use of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, and, although free implementations are available, their deployment in general requires a certain degree of programming expertise. This paper presents a user-friendly web-based application, specifically designed for the biomedical professional, that supports the entire process of topic modeling and comparative trends analysis of scientific literature. The application was evaluated for its efficacy and usability by intended users with no programming expertise (15 biomedical professionals). Results of evaluation showed a positive acceptance of system functionalities and an overall usability score of 76/100 in the System Usability Score (SUS) scale. This suggests that literature topic modeling can become more popular amongst biomedical professionals via the use of a user-friendly application that fully supports the entire workflow, thus opening new perspectives for literature review and scientific research.","Kavvadias, Drosatos, Kaldoudi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103574","20201020","Semantic analysis; Topic modeling; Trend analysis; Visualization; Web application","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16132,""
"Domain Classification and Analysis of National Institutes of Health Funded Medical Physics Research","The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) previously developed a research database consisting of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants that were awarded to its members. The purpose of this report is to classify these NIH grants into various medical physics subdisciplines and analyze the scope of AAPM member research. For this report, an algorithm classified grant topics into medical physics research subdisciplines (grants from 2002 to 2019 were analyzed). This algorithm utilized a search for common words and phrases within grant titles, keywords, abstracts, and activity codes to perform the classification. AAPM member grants were compared with non-AAPM member grants in various relevant subcategories to assess what percentage of these grants were held by AAPM members. The percentage of AAPM member grants that included words relating to both imaging and therapy (image-guided therapy grants) increased from 13% (27/207) in 2002 to 27% (79/293) in 2019. The percentage of AAPM member grants utilizing words relating to artificial intelligence increased from 8% in 2002 to 20% in 2019. From 2002 to 2019, AAPM member grants referenced cancer more than all other diseases combined. The majority of AAPM member grants included words relating to clinical research (81% of grants in 2002 and 99% in 2019). When comparing AAPM member with non-AAPM member grants it was found that in 2019 AAPM members held a substantial fraction of all NIH grants that referenced stereotactic radiation therapies (41%), radionuclide therapies (10%), brachytherapies (35%), intensity-modulated radiation therapies (45%), and external beam particle therapies (55%). From 2002 to 2019, the percentage of AAPM membership holding NIH grants decreased for males (3.2% down to 2.3%) and increased for females (0.8% up to 1.3%) CONCLUSIONS: The majority of grants awarded to AAPM members focus on clinical research, which underlies the translational aspect of medical physics and suggests medical physicists are uniquely positioned to help translate new technologies such as artificial intelligence into the clinic. Since 2002, NIH grants awarded to AAPM members have increasingly referenced some form of image-guided therapy, suggesting opportunities for continued innovation of imaging technologies. A substantial fraction of all radiotherapy-related research grants were awarded to AAPM members, emphasizing the important role physicists have in developing radiotherapy-related treatments.","Scarpelli, Whelan, Farahani","https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14469","20200924","American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM); National Institutes of Health (NIH); grant; medical physics; research funding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16133,""
"Epidemiological models for predicting Ross River virus in Australia: AÃ‚Â systematic review","Ross River virus (RRV) is the most common and widespread arbovirus in Australia. Epidemiological models of RRV increase understanding of RRV transmission and help provide early warning of outbreaks to reduce incidence. However, RRV predictive models have not been systematically reviewed, analysed, and compared. The hypothesis of this systematic review was that summarising the epidemiological models applied to predict RRV disease and analysing model performance could elucidate drivers of RRV incidence and transmission patterns. We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus for studies of RRV using population-based data, incorporating at least one epidemiological model and analysing the association between exposures and RRV disease. Forty-three articles, all of high or medium quality, were included. Twenty-two (51.2%) used generalised linear models and 11 (25.6%) used time-series models. Climate and weather data were used in 27 (62.8%) and mosquito abundance or related data were used in 14 (32.6%) articles as model covariates. A total of 140 models were included across the articles. Rainfall (69 models, 49.3%), temperature (66, 47.1%) and tide height (45, 32.1%) were the three most commonly used exposures. Ten (23.3%) studies published data related to model performance. This review summarises current knowledge of RRV modelling and reveals a research gap in comparing predictive methods. To improve predictive accuracy, new methods for forecasting, such as non-linear mixed models and machine learning approaches, warrant investigation.","Qian, Viennet, Glass, Harley","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008621","20201028","Alphavirus Infections; Animals; Australia; Climate; Culicidae; Forecasting; Humans; Incidence; Ross River virus; Weather","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16134,""
"The 2019 National Natural language processing (NLP) Clinical Challenges (n2c2)/Open Health NLP (OHNLP) shared task on clinical concept normalization for clinical records","The 2019 National Natural language processing (NLP) Clinical Challenges (n2c2)/Open Health NLP (OHNLP) shared task track 3, focused on medical concept normalization (MCN) in clinical records. This track aimed to assess the state of the art in identifying and matching salient medical concepts to a controlled vocabulary. In this paper, we describe the task, describe the data set used, compare the participating systems, present results, identify the strengths and limitations of the current state of the art, and identify directions for future research. Participating teams were provided with narrative discharge summaries in which text spans corresponding to medical concepts were identified. This paper refers to these text spans as mentions. Teams were tasked with normalizing these mentions to concepts, represented by concept unique identifiers, within the Unified Medical Language System. Submitted systems represented 4 broad categories of approaches: cascading dictionary matching, cosine distance, deep learning, and retrieve-and-rank systems. Disambiguation modules were common across all approaches. A total of 33 teams participated in the MCN task. The best-performing team achieved an accuracy of 0.8526. The median and mean performances among all teams were 0.7733 and 0.7426, respectively. Overall performance among the top 10 teams was high. However, several mention types were challenging for all teams. These included mentions requiring disambiguation of misspelled words, acronyms, abbreviations, and mentions with more than 1 possible semantic type. Also challenging were complex mentions of long, multi-word terms that may require new ways of extracting and representing mention meaning, the use of domain knowledge, parse trees, or hand-crafted rules.","Henry, Wang, Shen, Uzuner","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa106","20201016","clinical narratives; concept normalization; machine learning; natural language processing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16135,""
"Tumor heterogeneity estimation for radiomics in cancer","Radiomics is an emerging field of medical image analysis research where quantitative measurements are obtained from radiological images that can be utilized to predict patient outcomes and inform treatment decisions. Cancer patients routinely undergo radiological evaluations when images of various modalities including computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance images are collected for diagnosis and for evaluation of disease progression. Tumor characteristics, often referred to as measures of tumor heterogeneity, can be computed using these clinical images and used as predictors of disease progression and patient survival. Several approaches for quantifying tumor heterogeneity have been proposed, including intensity histogram-based measures, shape and volume-based features, and texture analysis. Taking into account the topology of the tumors we propose a statistical framework for estimating tumor heterogeneity using clustering based on Markov random field theory. We model the voxel intensities using a Gaussian mixture model using a Gibbs prior to incorporate voxel neighborhood information. We propose a novel approach to choosing the number of mixture components. Subsequently, we show that the proposed procedure outperforms the existing approaches when predicting lung cancer survival.","Eloyan, Yue, Khachatryan","https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8749","20200923","Markov random fields; cancer imaging; computed tomography; image segmentation; machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16136,""
"Augmented Reality Interface for Complex Anatomy Learning in the Central Nervous System: A Systematic Review","The medical system is facing the transformations with augmentation in the use of medical information systems, electronic records, smart, wearable devices, and handheld. The central nervous system function is to control the activities of the mind and the human body. Modern speedy development in medical and computational growth in the field of the central nervous system enables practitioners and researchers to extract and visualize insight from these systems. The function of augmented reality is to incorporate virtual and real objects, interactively running in a real-time and real environment. The role of augmented reality in the central nervous system becomes a thought-provoking task. Gesture interaction approach-based augmented reality in the central nervous system has enormous impending for reducing the care cost, quality refining of care, and waste and error reducing. To make this process smooth, it would be effective to present a comprehensive study report of the available state-of-the-art-work for enabling doctors and practitioners to easily use it in the decision making process. This comprehensive study will finally summarise the outputs of the published materials associate to gesture interaction-based augmented reality approach in the central nervous system. This research uses the protocol of systematic literature which systematically collects, analyses, and derives facts from the collected papers. The data collected range from the published materials for 10 years. 78 papers were selected and included papers based on the predefined inclusion, exclusion, and quality criteria. The study supports to identify the studies related to augmented reality in the nervous system, application of augmented reality in the nervous system, technique of augmented reality in the nervous system, and the gesture interaction approaches in the nervous system. The derivations from the studies show that there is certain amount of rise-up in yearly wise articles, and numerous studies exist, related to augmented reality and gestures interaction approaches to different systems of the human body, specifically to the nervous system. This research organises and summarises the existing associated work, which is in the form of published materials, and are related to augmented reality.

"Neuroimaging advances regarding subjective cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease","Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is regarded as the first clinical manifestation in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. Investigating populations with SCD is important for understanding the early pathological mechanisms of AD and identifying SCD-related biomarkers, which are critical for the early detection of AD. With the advent of advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), accumulating evidence has revealed structural and functional brain alterations related to the symptoms of SCD. In this review, we summarize the main imaging features and key findings regarding SCD related to AD, from local and regional data to connectivity-based imaging measures, with the aim of delineating a multimodal imaging signature of SCD due to AD. Additionally, the interaction of SCD with other risk factors for dementia due to AD, such as age and the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) Ã‰â€º4 status, has also been described. Finally, the possible explanations for the inconsistent and heterogeneous neuroimaging findings observed in individuals with SCD are discussed, along with future directions. Overall, the literature reveals a preferential vulnerability of AD signature regions in SCD in the context of AD, supporting the notion that individuals with SCD share a similar pattern of brain alterations with patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia due to AD. We conclude that these neuroimaging techniques, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, have great potential for identifying the underlying pathological alterations associated with SCD. More longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes combined with more advanced imaging modeling approaches such as artificial intelligence are still warranted to establish their clinical utility.","Wang, Huang, Su, Xing, Jessen, Sun, Shu, Han","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13024-020-00395-3","20201001","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; PET; multimodal MRI; neuroimaging; subjective cognitive decline","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16138,""

In this study, we explore acupoint specificity through reverse inferences from the dataset of prescribed acupoints for a certain disease in clinical trials. We searched acupuncture treatment regimens in randomized controlled trials included in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. For forward inference, the acupoints prescribed for each disease were quantified. For reverse inference, diseases for each acupoint were quantified. Data were normalized using Z-scores. Bayes factor correction was performed to adjust for the prior probability of diseases. The specificities of acupoint selections in 30 diseases were determined using forward inference. The specificities of acupoint indications regarding 49 acupoints were identified using reverse inference and then subjected to Bayes factor correction. Two types of acupoint indications were identified for 24 acupoints: regional and distal. Our approach suggests that the specificity of acupoint indication can be inferred from clinical data using reverse inference. Acupoint indication will improve our understanding of acupoint specificity and will lead to the establishment of a new model of analysis and educational resources for acupoint characteristics.","Hwang, Lee, Ryu, Lee, Chae","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9093027","20201027","Bayesian modeling; acupoint indication; acupoint specificity; clinical trials; data mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16140,""
"Dementia medical screening using mobile applications: A systematic review with a new mapping model","Early detection is the key to successfully tackling dementia, a neurocognitive condition common among the elderly. Therefore, screening using technological platforms such as mobile applications (apps) may provide an important opportunity to speed up the diagnosis process and improve accessibility. Due to the lack of research into dementia diagnosis and screening tools based on mobile apps, this systematic review aims to identify the available mobile-based dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) apps using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. More importantly, we critically analyse these tools in terms of their comprehensiveness, validity, performance, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The research findings suggest diagnosticians in a clinical setting use dementia screening apps such as ALZ and CognitiveExams since they cover most of the domains for the diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders. Further, apps such as Cognity and ACE-Mobile have great potential as they use machine learning (ML) and AI techniques, thus improving the accuracy of the outcome and the efficiency of the screening process. Lastly, there was overlapping among the dementia screening apps in terms of activities and questions they contain therefore mapping these apps to the designated cognitive domains is a challenging task, which has been done in this research.","Thabtah, Peebles, Retzler, Hathurusingha","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103573","20201025","Cognitive mapping; Dementia; MCI; Machine learning; Mobile apps; Neurodegenerative areas; Screening methods; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16141,""

"Text mining for modeling of protein complexes enhanced by machine learning","Procedures for structural modeling of protein-protein complexes (protein docking) produce a number of models which need to be further analyzed and scored. Scoring can be based on independently determined constraints on the structure of the complex, such as knowledge of amino acids essential for the protein interaction. Previously, we showed that text mining of residues in freely available PubMed abstracts of papers on studies of protein-protein interactions may generate such constraints. However, absence of post-processing of the spotted residues reduced usability of the constraints, as a significant number of the residues were not relevant for the binding of the specific proteins. We explored filtering of the irrelevant residues by two machine learning approaches, Deep Recursive Neural Network (DRNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models with different training/testing schemes. The results showed that the DRNN model is superior to the SVM model when training is performed on the PMC-OA full-text articles and applied to classification (interface or non-interface) of the residues spotted in the PubMed abstracts. When both training and testing is performed on full-text articles or on abstracts, the performance of these models is similar. Thus, in such cases, there is no need to utilize computationally demanding DRNN approach, which is computationally expensive especially at the training stage. The reason is that SVM success is often determined by the similarity in data/text patterns in the training and the testing sets, whereas the sentence structures in the abstracts are, in general, different from those in the full text articles.

"Modeling texture in deep 3D CNN for survival analysis","Radiomics has shown remarkable potential for predicting the survival outcome for various types of cancers such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, to date, there has been limited research using convolutional neural networks (CNN) with radiomic methods for this task, due to their requirement for large training sets. To overcome this issue, we propose a new type of radiomic descriptor modeling the distribution of learned features with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). These parametric features (GMM-CNN) are computed from gross tumor volumes of PDAC patients defined semiautomatically in pre-operative computed tomography (CT) scans. We use the proposed GMM-CNN features as input to a robust classifier based on random forests (RF) to predict the survival outcome of patients with PDAC. Our experiments assess the advantage of GMM-CNN compared to employing the same 3D CNN model directly, standard radiomic (i.e., histogram, texture and shape), conditional entropy (CENT) based on 3DCNN, and clinical features (i.e., serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and chemotherapy neoadjuvant). Using the RF model (100 samples for training; 59 samples for validation), GMM-CNN features provided the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 72.0% (p = 6.4105) compared to 64.0% (p = 0.01) for the 3D CNN model output, 66.8% (p = 0.01) for standard radiomic features, 64.2% (p = 0.003) for CENT, and 57.6% (p = 0.3) for clinical variables. Our results suggest that the proposed GMM-CNN features used with a RF classifier can significantly improve the capacity to prognosticate PDAC patients prior to surgery via routinely-acquired imaging data.","Chaddad, Sargos, Desrosiers","https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.3025901","20200923","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16144,""
"Artificial Intelligence in Renal Mass Characterization: A Systematic Review of Methodologic Items Related to Modeling, Performance Evaluation, Clinical Utility, and Transparency","<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The objective of our study was to systematically review the literature about the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to renal mass characterization with a focus on the methodologic quality items. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed to identify original research studies about the application of AI to renal mass characterization. Besides baseline study characteristics, a total of 15 methodologic quality items were extracted and evaluated on the basis of the following four main categories: modeling, performance evaluation, clinical utility, and transparency items. The qualitative synthesis was presented using descriptive statistics with an accompanying narrative. <b>RESULTS.</b> Thirty studies were included in this systematic review. Overall, the methodologic quality items were mostly favorable for modeling (63%) and performance evaluation (63%). Even so, the studies (57%) more frequently constructed their work on nonrobust features. Furthermore, only a few studies (10%) had a generalizability assessment with independent or external validation. The studies were mostly unsuccessful in terms of clinical utility evaluation (89%) and transparency (97%) items. For clinical utility, the interesting findings were lack of comparisons with both radiologists' evaluation (87%) and traditional models (70%) in most of the studies. For transparency, most studies (97%) did not share their data with the public. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> To bring AI-based renal mass characterization from research to practice, future studies need to improve modeling and performance evaluation strategies and pay attention to clinical utility and transparency issues.","Kocak, Kaya, Erdim, Kus, Kilickesmez","https://doi.org/10.2214/AJR.20.22847","20201022","artificial intelligence (AI); machine learning; radiomics; renal cell carcinoma; renal mass","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16145,""
"A Quantitative Retrospective Exposure Assessment for Former Chrysotile Asbestos Miners and Millers from Baie Verte, NL, Canada","Despite numerous studies of asbestos workers in the epidemiologic literature, there are very few cohort studies of chrysotile asbestos miners/millers that include high-quality retrospective exposure assessments. As part of the creation of the Baie Verte Miners' Registry in 2008, a two-dimensional job exposure matrix (JEM) was developed for estimating asbestos exposures for former chrysotile asbestos miners/millers. Industrial hygiene data collected between 1963 and 1994 were analysed to assess validity for use in a retrospective exposure assessment and epidemiologic study. Registered former employees were divided into 52 exposure groups (EGs) based on job title and department and mean asbestos concentrations were calculated for each EG. The resulting exposure estimates were linked to individual registrants' work histories allowing for the calculation of cumulative asbestos exposure for each registrant. The distribution of exposure for most EGs (82.6%) could be described as fitting a log-normal distribution, although variability within some EGs (55%) exceeded a geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 2.5. Overall, the data used to create EGs in the development of the JEM were deemed to be of adequate quality for estimating cumulative asbestos exposures for the former employees of the Baie Verte asbestos mine/mill. The variability between workers in the same job was often high and is an important factor to be considered when using estimates of cumulative asbestos exposure to adjudicate compensation claims. The exposures experienced in this cohort were comparable to those of other chrysotile asbestos miners/millers cohorts, specifically Italian and QuÃƒÂ©bec cohorts.","Giles Murphy, Bornstein, Oudyk, Demers","https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxaa092","20200922","asbestos; asbestos exposure; chrysotile; exposure assessment; exposure estimation; exposure groups; mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16146,""
"Machine Learning Maps Research Needs in COVID-19 Literature","As of August 2020, thousands of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) publications have been produced. Manual assessment of their scope is an overwhelming task, and shortcuts through metadata analysis (e.g., keywords) assume that studies are properly tagged. However, machine learning approaches can rapidly survey the actual text of publication abstracts to identify research overlap between COVID-19 and other coronaviruses, research hotspots, and areas warranting exploration. We propose a fast, scalable, and reusable framework to parse novel disease literature. When applied to the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), dimensionality reduction suggests that COVID-19 studies to date are primarily clinical-, modeling- or field-based, in contrast to the vast quantity of laboratory-driven research for other (non-COVID-19) coronavirus diseases. Furthermore, topic modeling indicates that COVID-19 publications have focused on public health, outbreak reporting, clinical care, and testing for coronaviruses, as opposed to the more limited number focused on basic microbiology, including pathogenesis and transmission.","Doanvo, Qian, Ramjee, Piontkivska, Desai, Majumder","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2020.100123","20201009","2019-nCoV; COVID-19; LDA; PCA; SARS-CoV-2; artificial intelligence; coronavirus; data science; dimensionality reduction; machine learning; natural language processing; topic modeling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16147,""
"Deep learning to estimate RECIST in patients with NSCLC treated with PD-1 blockade","Real-world evidence (RWE) - conclusions derived from analysis of patients not treated in clinical trials - is increasingly recognized as an opportunity for discovery, to reduce disparities, and to contribute to regulatory approval. Maximal value of RWE may be facilitated through machine learning techniques to integrate and interrogate large and otherwise underutilized data sets. In cancer research, an ongoing challenge for RWE is the lack of reliable, reproducible, scalable assessment of treatment-specific outcomes. We hypothesized a deep learning model could be trained to use radiology text reports to estimate gold-standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)-defined outcomes. Using text reports from patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with PD-1 blockade in a training cohort and two test cohorts, we developed a deep learning model to accurately estimate best overall response and progression-free survival. Our model may be a tool to determine outcomes at scale, enabling analyses of large clinical databases.","Arbour, Luu, Luo, Rizvi, Plodkowski, Sakhi, Huang, Digumarthy, Ginsberg, Girshman, Kris, Riely, Yala, Gainor, Barzilay, Hellmann","https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-0419","20201016","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16148,""
"Are we ready for artificial intelligence health monitoring in elder care?","The world is experiencing a dramatic increase in the aging population, challenging the sustainability of traditional care models that have relied on in-person monitoring. This debate article discusses whether artificial intelligence health monitoring may be suitable enhancement or replacement for elder care. Internationally, as life expectancy continues to rise, many countries are facing a severe shortage of direct care workers. The health workforce is aging, and replacement remains a challenge. Artificial intelligence health monitoring technologies may play a novel and significant role in filling the human resource gaps in caring for older adults by complementing current care provision, reducing the burden on family caregivers, and improving the quality of care. Nonetheless, opportunities brought on by these emerging technologies raise ethical questions that must be addressed to ensure that these automated systems can truly enhance care and health outcomes for older adults. This debate article explores some ethical dimensions of using automated health monitoring technologies. It argues that, in order for these health monitoring technologies to fulfill the wishes of older adults to age in place and also to empower them and improve their quality of life, we need deep knowledge of how stakeholders may balance their considerations of relational care, safety, and privacy. It is only when we design artificial intelligence health monitoring technologies with intersecting clinical and ethical factors in mind that the resulting systems will enhance productive relational care, facilitate independent living, promote older adults' health outcomes, and minimize waste.","Ho","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-020-01764-9","20201001","Aging in place; Artificial intelligence; Ethics; Health monitoring; Independent living; Machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16149,""
"AI Approaches Towards Prechtl's Assessment of General Movements: A Systematic Literature Review","General movements (GMs) are spontaneous movements of infants up to five months post-term involving the whole body varying in sequence, speed, and amplitude. The assessment of GMs has shown its importance for identifying infants at risk for neuromotor deficits, especially for the detection of cerebral palsy. As the assessment is based on videos of the infant that are rated by trained professionals, the method is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, approaches based on Artificial Intelligence have gained significantly increased attention in the last years. In this article, we systematically analyze and discuss the main design features of all existing technological approaches seeking to transfer the Prechtl's assessment of general movements from an individual visual perception to computer-based analysis. After identifying their shared shortcomings, we explain the methodological reasons for their limited practical performance and classification rates. As a conclusion of our literature study, we conceptually propose a methodological solution to the defined problem based on the groundbreaking innovation in the area of Deep Learning.","Irshad, Nisar, Gouverneur, Rapp, Grzegorzek","https://doi.org/10.3390/s20185321","20201029","artificial neural network; cerebral palsy; fidgety movements; general movement assessment; machine learning; motion sensors; multimodal sensing; physical activity assessment; visual sensors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16150,""
"Association of MMP-9 polymorphisms with diabetic nephropathy risk: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a multifactorial disease with gene-environment interaction resulting in progressive renal function damage. Multiple studies have assessed the association between matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) gene promoter polymorphism and DN susceptibility. However, the results are inconclusive. In the present study, we will conduct a meta-analysis to further examine this relationship more precisely. Electronic databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar, Wanfang, China Biological Medicine and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) will be used to search clinical case-control studies about MMP-9 polymorphism and DN published until 18 August 2020. The language will be restricted to Chinese and English. Two reviewers will take charge of completing the selection of study, the extraction of data as well as the assessment of study quality independently. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale will be used to evaluate the study quality. We will evaluate the association under 5 genetic models. Fixed-effects or random-effects models will be used to calculate the effect sizes of odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Afterwards, subgroup analysis will be conducted in terms of the ethnicity and genotyping method. Additionally, sensitivity analysis will be performed via sequentially omitting each of the included studies one at a time. The funnel plots, Egger regression test, and Begg rank correlation test will be used to test the potential publication bias. All the statistical analyses will be performed using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 12.0.

PubMed, OVID/Medline, and Cochrane libraries were queried in November 2019 for research articles pertaining to AI use for detection of ACL and meniscus tears. Information regarding AI model, prediction accuracy/area under the curve (AUC), sample sizes of testing/training sets, and imaging modalities were recorded. A total of 11 AI studies were identified: 5 investigated ACL tears, 5 investigated meniscal tears, and 1 investigated both. The AUC of AI models for detecting ACL tears ranged from 0.895 to 0.980, and the prediction accuracy ranged from 86.7% to 100%. Of these studies, 3 compared AI models to clinical experts. Two found no significant differences in diagnostic capability, whereas one found that radiologists had a significantly greater sensitivity for detecting ACL tears (PÃ‚Â = .002) and statistically similar specificity and accuracy. Of the 5 studies investigating the meniscus, the AUC for AI models ranged from 0.847 to 0.910 and prediction accuracy ranged from 75.0% to 90.0%. Of these studies, 2 compared AI models with clinical experts. One found no significant differences in diagnostic accuracy, whereas one found that the AI model had a significantly lower specificity (PÃ‚Â = .003) and accuracy (PÃ‚Â = .015) than radiologists. Two studies reported that the addition of AI models significantly increased the diagnostic performance of clinicians compared to their efforts without these models. AI prediction capabilities were excellent and may enhance the diagnosis of ACL and meniscal pathology; however, AI did not outperform clinical experts. AI models promise to improve diagnosing certain pathologies as well as or better than human experts, are excellent for detecting ACL and meniscus tears, and may enhance the diagnostic capabilities of human experts; however, when compared with these experts, they may not offer any significant advantage.","Kunze, Rossi, White, Karhade, Deng, Williams, Chahla","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2020.09.012","20201019","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16152,""
"Technological advancements and opportunities in Neuromarketing: a systematic review","Neuromarketing has become an academic and commercial area of interest, as the advancements in neural recording techniques and interpreting algorithms have made it an effective tool for recognizing the unspoken response of consumers to the marketing stimuli. This article presents the very first systematic review of the technological advancements in Neuromarketing field over the last 5 years. For this purpose, authors have selected and reviewed a total of 57 relevant literatures from valid databases which directly contribute to the Neuromarketing field with basic or empirical research findings. This review finds consumer goods as the prevalent marketing stimuli used in both product and promotion forms in these selected literatures. A trend of analyzing frontal and prefrontal alpha band signals is observed among the consumer emotion recognition-based experiments, which corresponds to frontal alpha asymmetry theory. The use of electroencephalogram (EEG) is found favorable by many researchers over functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in video advertisement-based Neuromarketing experiments, apparently due to its low cost and high time resolution advantages. Physiological response measuring techniques such as eye tracking, skin conductance recording, heart rate monitoring, and facial mapping have also been found in these empirical studies exclusively or in parallel with brain recordings. Alongside traditional filtering methods, independent component analysis (ICA) was found most commonly in artifact removal from neural signal. In consumer response prediction and classification, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) have performed with the highest average accuracy among other machine learning algorithms used in these literatures. The authors hope, this review will assist the future researchers with vital information in the field of Neuromarketing for making novel contributions.","Rawnaque, Rahman, Anwar, Vaidyanathan, Chau, Sarker, Mamun","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40708-020-00109-x","20201006","Brain computer interface; Machine learning algorithm; Marketing; Neural recording; Neuromarketing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16153,""
"Novel Method to Flag Cardiac Implantable Device Infections by Integrating Text Mining With Structured Data in the Veterans Health Administration's Electronic Medical Record","Health care-associated infections (HAIs) are preventable, harmful, and costly; however, few resources are dedicated to infection surveillance of nonsurgical procedures, particularly cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) procedures. To develop a method that includes text mining of electronic clinical notes to reliably and efficiently measure HAIs for CIED procedures. In this multicenter, national cohort study using electronic medical record data for patients undergoing CIED procedures in Veterans Health Administration (VA) facilities for fiscal years (FYs) 2016 and 2017, an algorithm to flag cases with a true CIED-related infection based on structured (eg, microbiology orders, vital signs) and free text diagnostic and therapeutic data (eg, procedure notes, discharge summaries, microbiology results) was developed and validated. Procedure data were divided into development and validation data sets. Criterion validity (ie, positive predictive validity [PPV], sensitivity, and specificity) was assessed via criterion-standard manual medical record review. CIED procedure. The concordance between medical record review and the study algorithm with respect to the presence or absence of a CIED infection. CIED infection in the algorithm included 90-day mortality, congestive heart failure and nonmetastatic tumor comorbidities, CIED or surgical site infection International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes, antibiotic treatment of Staphylococci, a microbiology test of a cardiac specimen, and text documentation of infection in specific clinical notes (eg, cardiology, infectious diseases, inpatient discharge summaries).

"Evidence-based strategies for interdental cleaning: a practical decision tree and review of the literature","Although several studies have investigated the effectiveness of various interdental cleaning devices, there is a need for an evidence-based synopsis for clinicians to customize interdental hygiene instructions and provide specific devices for each patient. This literature review aims to establish an evidence-based decision-making tree recommending individualized approaches to interdental cleaning based on embrasure size and patient-specific conditions. Specific keywords related to interdental cleaning were used to search and identify the existing literature in PubMed and the Cochrane Library. Through a series of review processes, qualifying studies were identified and assessed with respect to the inclusion criteria to establish the decision tree. A total of 27 studies were included to support a decision tree. Traditional dental floss continues to remain the first choice for individuals of high motivation and good manual dexterity with type I closed embrasures. For individuals with closed embrasures, but lack of motivation and/or dexterity, the use of easy flossers, soft picks, oral irrigation, and small (0.6 to 0.7 mm) interdental brushes are alternatives. For individuals with type II and type III open embrasure spaces, an interdental brush has the highest evidence for its effectiveness to remove interdental plaque. However, two studies showed that residual plaque could be found over lingual embrasures and thus lingual approach of the interdental brush is sometimes needed. The use of gum stimulators and/or woodsticks continues to be supported when significant gingival inflammation is present. Each patient should be individually assessed and given tailored oral hygiene home care instructions for the most effective outcomes. The proposed decision tree provides clinicians with an evidence-based guideline to help customize the use of interdental cleaning devices for each patient.

"A balancing act: racial disparities in cardiovascular disease mortality among women diagnosed with breast cancer","The cardiotoxic effects of breast cancer therapies are well documented in clinical trials. However, clinical trials often underrepresent those at highest risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD)related outcomes and have limited generalizability to the larger breast cancer population. In addition, racial differences in treatment-associated CVD mortality have yet to be explored. In this study, we sought to quantify the relationship between breast cancer therapies and CVD mortality, and explore whether this effect differed between non-Hispanic black (NHB) and white (NHW) women. Using data from the Georgia Cancer Registry, we identified women diagnosed with a first primary invasive breast cancer [2010-2014], residing in the metropolitan Atlanta area (n=3,580 NHB; n=4,923 NHW), and followed them for mortality through December 31, 2018. Exposures of interest included therapies with potential cardiotoxic effects including chemotherapy and hormone therapy, which are routinely collected by the GCR. Individual agents are not captured within the GCR, therefore trastuzumab was identified using natural language processing of textual descriptions. We used propensity score weighted Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between each treatment modality and CVD mortality among the overall cohort and by race. In the overall cohort, similar hazards of CVD mortality were found among women treated with chemotherapy (HR =1.10, 95% CI: 0.62, 1.96) and hormone therapy (HR =0.94, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.50), compared to women who did not receive the respective treatments. In contrast, women treated with trastuzumab had a higher hazard of CVD mortality compared to women not treated with trastuzumab (HR =2.05, 95% CI: 0.76, 5.52). In race-specific models, hormone therapy was associated with a higher hazard of CVD mortality among NHB women (HR =2.18, 95% CI: 0.78, 6.12), but not NHW women (HR =0.66, 95% CI: 0.39, 1.13). Similar, albeit attenuated, associations were found for chemotherapy. We were unable to investigate race-specific effects of trastuzumab due to low prevalence and insufficient number of events. In our study, we observed more pronounced associations of chemotherapy and hormone therapy with CVD mortality among NHB women, for whom we know have greater CVD-related comorbidities at breast cancer diagnosis. Patients may benefit from treatment plans that find a balance between curative breast cancer treatment and prevention of CVD-related events and mortality. CVD-related outcomes may be most relevant for women with hormone receptor positive disease due to shared risk factors (e.g., obesity, tobacco use, physical activity) and longer survival.","Collin, Troeschel, Liu, Gogineni, Borger, Ward, McCullough","https://doi.org/10.21037/ace.2020.01.02","20200928","Breast neoplasms; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular diseases; health disparities; mortality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16156,""

Various types of data such as electronic health records (EHRs), medical images, and complicated text which are diversified, poorly interpreted, and extensively unorganized have been used in the modern medical research. This is an important reason for the cause of various unorganized and unstructured datasets due to emergence of mobile applications along with the healthcare systems. In this paper, a systematic review is carried out on application of AI and the big data analytics to improve the m-health system. Various AI-based algorithms and frameworks of big data with respect to the source of data, techniques used, and the area of application are also discussed.

"A Semantic Analysis and Community Detection-Based Artificial Intelligence Model for Core Herb Discovery from the Literature: Taking Chronic Glomerulonephritis Treatment as a Case Study","The Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula is the main treatment method of TCM. A formula often contains multiple herbs where core herbs play a critical therapeutic effect for treating diseases. It is of great significance to find out the core herbs in formulae for providing evidences and references for the clinical application of Chinese herbs and formulae. In this paper, we propose a core herb discovery model CHDSC based on semantic analysis and community detection to discover the core herbs for treating a certain disease from large-scale literature, which includes three stages: corpus construction, herb network establishment, and core herb discovery. In CHDSC, two artificial intelligence modules are used, where the Chinese word embedding algorithm ESSP2VEC is designed to analyse the semantics of herbs in Chinese literature based on the stroke, structure, and pinyin features of Chinese characters, and the label propagation-based algorithm LILPA is adopted to detect herb communities and core herbs in the herbal semantic network constructed from large-scale literature. To validate the proposed model, we choose chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) as an example, search 1126 articles about how to treat CGN in TCM from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and apply CHDSC to analyse the collected literature. Experimental results reveal that CHDSC discovers three major herb communities and eighteen core herbs for treating different CGN syndromes with high accuracy. The community size, degree, and closeness centrality distributions of the herb network are analysed to mine the laws of core herbs. As a result, we can observe that core herbs mainly exist in the communities with more than 25 herbs. The degree and closeness centrality of core herb nodes concentrate on the range of [15, 40] and [0.25, 0.45], respectively. Thus, semantic analysis and community detection are helpful for mining effective core herbs for treating a certain disease from large-scale literature.","Zhang, Liu, Zhu, Zhai, Jin, Wen","https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/1862168","20200923","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16158,""
"Use and performance of machine learning models for type 2 diabetes prediction in community settings: A systematic review and meta-analysis","We aimed to identify machine learning (ML) models for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) prediction in community settings and determine their predictive performance. Systematic review of ML predictive modelling studies in 13 databases since 2009 was conducted. Primary outcomes included metrics of discrimination, calibration, and classification. Secondary outcomes included important variables, level of validation, and intended use of models. Meta-analysis of c-indices, subgroup analyses, meta-regression, publication bias assessments and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Twenty-three studies (40 prediction models) were included. Studies with high-, moderate-, and low- risk of bias were 3, 14, and 6 respectively. All studies conducted internal validation whereas none conducted external validation of their models. Twenty studies provided classification metrics to varying extents whereas only 7 studies performed model calibration. Eighteen studies reported information on both the variables used for model development and the feature importance. Twelve studies highlighted potential applicability of their models for T2DM screening. Meta-analysis produced a good pooled c-index (0.812). Sources of heterogeneity were identified through subgroup analyses and meta-regression. Issues pertaining to methodological quality and reporting were observed. We found evidence of good performance of ML models for T2DM prediction in the community. Improvements to methodology, reporting and validation are needed before they can be used at scale.","Silva, Lee, Forbes, Demmer, Barton, Enticott","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104268","20201027","Diabetes mellitus; Diagnosis; Machine learning; Meta-Analysis; Prognosis; Type 2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16159,""
"Extracting and classifying diagnosis dates from clinical notes: A case study","Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are chronic hematologic malignancies that may progress over long disease courses. The original date of diagnosis is an important piece of information for patient care and research, but is not consistently documented. We describe an attempt to build a pipeline for extracting dates with natural language processing (NLP) tools and techniques and classifying them as relevant diagnoses or not. Inaccurate and incomplete date extraction and interpretation impacted the performance of the overall pipeline. Existing lightweight Python packages tended to have low specificity for identifying and interpreting partial and relative dates in clinical text. A rules-based regular expression (regex) approach achieved recall of 83.0% on dates manually annotated as diagnosis dates, and 77.4% on all annotated dates. With only 3.8% of annotated dates representing initial MPN diagnoses, additional methods of targeting candidate date instances may alleviate noise and class imbalance.","Fu, Sholle, Krichevsky, Scandura, Campion","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103569","20201020","Classification; Clinical text; Natural language processing; Temporality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16160,""

This review is dedicated to X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP). We screened 233 citations and curated phenotypic and genotypic data for 414 cases. To reduce data missingness, we (1) contacted authors and engaged the research community to provide additional clinical and genetic information, and (2) revisited previously unpublished data from a cohort of XDP patients seen at our institution. Using these approaches, we expanded the cohort to 577 cases and increased information available for important clinical and genetic features such as age at onset, initial manifestation, predominant motor symptoms, functional impairments, and repeat size information.

"Lifetime quality of life and cost consequences of delays in endovascular treatment for acute ischaemic stroke: a cost-effectiveness analysis from a Singapore healthcare perspective","Endovascular therapy (EVT) significantly improves clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), while the time of EVT initiation after stroke onset influences both patient clinical outcomes and healthcare costs. This study determined the impact of EVT treatment delay on cost effectiveness of EVT in the Singapore healthcare setting. A short-term decision tree and long-term Markov health state transition model was constructed. For each time window of symptom onset to EVT, the probability of receiving EVT or non-EVT treatment was varied, thereby varying clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale scores), short-term costs and long-term modelled (lifetime) costs; all of which were used in calculating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EVT vs non-EVT treatment. Clinical outcomes and cost data were derived from clinical trials, literature, expert opinion, electronic medical records and community-based surveys from Singapore. Deterministic one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the uncertainty of the model. The willingness to pay for per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was set to Singapore $50Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 (US$36 500). Singapore healthcare perspective. The model included patients with AIS in Singapore. EVT performed within 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°hours of stroke onset. The model estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and net monetary benefits (NMB) for EVT versus non-EVT treatment, varied by time from symptom onset to time of treatment. EVT performed between 61 min and 120Ã¢â‚¬â€°min after the stroke onset was most cost-effective time window to perform EVT in the Singapore population, with an ICER of Singapore $7197 per QALY (US$5254) for performing EVT at 61-120Ã¢â‚¬â€°min versus 121-180Ã¢â‚¬â€°min. The resulting incremental NMB associated with receipt of EVT at the earlier time point is Singapore $39Ã¢â‚¬â€°827 (US$29 074) per patient at the willingness-to-pay threshold of Singapore $50Ã¢â‚¬â€°000. Each hour delay in EVT resulted in an average loss of 0.54 QALYs and 195.35 healthy days, with an average net monetary loss of Singapore $26Ã¢â‚¬â€°255 (US$19 166). From the Singapore healthcare perspective, although EVT is more expensive than alternative treatments in the short term, the lifetime ICER is below the willingness-to-pay threshold. Thus, healthcare policies and procedures should aim to improve efficiency of pre-hospital and in-hospital workflow processes to reduce the onset-to-puncture duration.","Ni, Kunz, Goyal, Ng, Tan, De Silva","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036517","20201028","health economics; neurology; stroke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16162,""

The objective of this study is to systematically review medical literature regarding treatment of HBV infection in adult chronic infection with HBeAg-positive patients. A systematic review was performed according to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement. Original studies that evaluated the effect of antivirals in adult chronic infection with HBeAg-positive patients were included. The outcomes of interest were viral load suppression, the loss/seroconversion of HBeAg, the loss/seroconversion of hepatitis B surface antigen, and the development of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. The search for eligible studies was performed in Excerpta Medica dataBASE, PubMed and Cochrane databases until January 2020, without language or date restriction. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies and the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials. Two hundred ninety-six articles were retrieved. After analyzing titles and abstracts, 287 articles were excluded and nine were considered potentially eligible. From these, five were excluded after full-text analysis. Finally, four articles were included. Only two were randomized controlled trials. All studies were carried out in Asian patients. Results were variable with regard to viral load, negativation/seroconversion of HBeAg and HBsAg. One study demonstrated that treated patients developed cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma less frequently than untreated individuals. Overall, the studies were of poor quality. In conclusion, the present systematic review demonstrated that, at present, there is not enough evidence to recommend treating this population of patients.","Tovo, Ahlert, Panke, de Mattos, de Mattos","https://doi.org/10.1097/MEG.0000000000001907","20200918","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16163,""
"Application of machine learning methods for the prediction of organic solid waste treatment and recycling processes: A review","Conventional treatment and recycling methods of organic solid waste contain inherent flaws, such as low efficiency, low accuracy, high cost, and potential environmental risks. In the past decade, machine learning has gradually attracted increasing attention in solving the complex problems of organic solid waste treatment. Although significant research has been carried out, there is a lack of a systematic review of the research findings in this field. This study sorts the research studies published between 2003 and 2020, summarizes the specific application fields, characteristics, and suitability of different machine learning models, and discusses the relevant application limitations and future prospects. It can be concluded that studies mostly focused on municipal solid waste management, followed by anaerobic digestion, thermal treatment, composting, and landfill. The most widely used model is the artificial neural network, which has been successfully applied to various complicated non-linear organic solid waste related problems.","Guo, Wu, Tian, Zhang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.124114","20201015","Machine learning; Modeling; Organic solid waste; Prediction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16164,""
"Artificial intelligence in paediatric radiology: Future opportunities","Artificial intelligence (AI) has received widespread and growing interest in healthcare, as a method to save time, cost and improve efficiencies. The high-performance statistics and diagnostic accuracies reported by using AI algorithms (with respect to predefined reference standards), particularly from image pattern recognition studies, have resulted in extensive applications proposed for clinical radiology, especially for enhanced image interpretation. Whilst certain sub-speciality areas in radiology, such as those relating to cancer screening, have received wide-spread attention in the media and scientific community, children's imaging has been hitherto neglected.In this article, we discuss a variety of possible 'use cases' in paediatric radiology from a patient pathway perspective where AI has either been implemented or shown early-stage feasibility, while also taking inspiration from the adult literature to propose potential areas for future development. We aim to demonstrate how a 'future, enhanced paediatric radiology service' could operate and to stimulate further discussion with avenues for research.","Davendralingam, Sebire, Arthurs, Shelmerdine","https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20200975","20200917","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16165,""

"Phenotypic clustering of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction reveals different rates of hospitalization","Approximately 50% of patients with heart failure have preserved (Ã¢â€°Â¥50%) ejection fraction (HFpEF). Improved understanding of the phenotypic heterogeneity of HFpEF might facilitate development of targeted therapies and interventions. This retrospective study characterized a cohort of patients with HFpEF based on similar clinical profiles and evaluated 1-year heart failure related hospitalization. Enrolment, medical and pharmacy data were used to identify patients newly diagnosed with heart failure enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug or commercial healthcare plan. To identify only those patients with HFpEF, we used natural language processing techniques of ejection fraction values abstracted from a linked free-text clinical notes data source. The study population comprised 1515 patients newly identified with HFpEF between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2015. Using unsupervised machine learning, we identified three distinguishable patient clusters representing different phenotypes: cluster-1 patients had the lowest prevalence of heart failure comorbidities and highest mean age; cluster-2 patients had higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome and pulmonary disease, despite younger mean age; and cluster-3 patients had higher prevalence of cardiac arrhythmia and renal disease. Cluster-3 had the highest 1-year heart failure related hospitalization rates. Within-cluster analysis, prior use of diuretics (cluster-1 and cluster-2) and age (cluster-2 and cluster-3) was associated with 1-year heart failure related hospitalization. Combination therapy was associated with decreased 1-year heart failure related hospitalization in cluster-1. This study demonstrated that clustering can be used to characterize subgroups of patients with newly identified HFpEF, assess differences in heart failure related hospitalization rates at 1 year and suggest patient subtypes may respond differently to treatments or interventions.","Casebeer, Horter, Hayden, Simmons, Evers","https://doi.org/10.2459/JCM.0000000000001116","20200917","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16167,""
"Impact of radiomics on prostate cancer detection: a systematic review of clinical applications","To systematically review the current literature to assess the role of radiomics in the detection and evaluation of prostate cancer (PCa). Radiomics involves the high-throughput extraction of radiologic features from clinical imaging, using a panel of sophisticated data-characterization algorithms to make an objective and quantitative determination of diagnoses and clinical characteristics. Radiomics evaluation of existing clinical images would increase their clinical value in many cancer management pathways, including PCa. However, a consensus on the implementation of radiomics has not been established across different sites, delaying its implementation in clinical practice. There are many potential advantages to radiomics. The ability to extract features from existing clinical imaging is one such advantage. A second is the empiric nature of the analysis. The third lies in the application of new technologies, such as machine learning, to be able to evaluate large quantities of data to make clinical conclusions. In this systematic review, we identify publications regarding the role of radiomics in PCa detection and evaluation. Many of these studies noted that radiomics, when incorporated into predictive models, had an advantageous impact on detection of PCa, clinically significant PCa, and extracapsular extension. This may assist in individualized decision making not only for diagnosis of PCa, but also for surveillance and surgical planning. With additional validation in large sample sizes, and randomized, multicenter studies using a consensus driven methodology, radiomics has the potential to alter the landscape of PCa detection and management, necessitating further prospective randomized investigation. Radiomics is a promising new field, allowing for high-throughput analysis of imaging features for PCa detection and evaluation. These features can be extracted from existing data; therefore, the potential for future study is immense.","Sugano, Sanford, Abreu, Duddalwar, Gill, Cacciamani","https://doi.org/10.1097/MOU.0000000000000822","20201005","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16168,""
"Assessing the enrichment of dietary supplement coverage in the Unified Medical Language System","We sought to assess the need for additional coverage of dietary supplements (DS) in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) by investigating (1) the overlap between the integrated DIetary Supplements Knowledge base (iDISK) DS ingredient terminology and the UMLS and (2) the coverage of iDISK and the UMLS over DS mentions in the biomedical literature. We estimated the overlap between iDISK and the UMLS by mapping iDISK to the UMLS using exact and normalized strings. The coverage of iDISK and the UMLS over DS mentions in the biomedical literature was evaluated via a DS named-entity recognition (NER) task within PubMed abstracts. The coverage analysis revealed that only 30% of iDISK terms can be matched to the UMLS, although these cover over 99% of iDISK concepts. A manual review revealed that a majority of the unmatched terms represented new synonyms, rather than lexical variants. For NER, iDISK nearly doubles the precision and achieves a higher F1 score than the UMLS, while maintaining a competitive recall. While iDISK has significant concept overlap with the UMLS, it contains many novel synonyms. Furthermore, almost 3000 of these overlapping UMLS concepts are missing a DS designation, which could be provided by iDISK. The NER experiments show that the specialization of iDISK is useful for identifying DS mentions. Our results show that the DS representation in the UMLS could be enriched by adding DS designations to many concepts and by adding new synonyms.","Vasilakes, Bompelli, Bishop, Adam, Bodenreider, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa128","20201022","dietary supplements; named entity recognition, natural language processing; terminology; unified medical language system","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16169,""

"Robot-Aided Systems for Improving the Assessment of Upper Limb Spasticity: A Systematic Review","Spasticity is a motor disorder that causes stiffness or tightness of the muscles and can interfere with normal movement, speech, and gait. Traditionally, the spasticity assessment is carried out by clinicians using standardized procedures for objective evaluation. However, these procedures are manually performed and, thereby, they could be influenced by the clinician's subjectivity or expertise. The automation of such traditional methods for spasticity evaluation is an interesting and emerging field in neurorehabilitation. One of the most promising approaches is the use of robot-aided systems. In this paper, a systematic review of systems focused on the assessment of upper limb (UL) spasticity using robotic technology is presented. A systematic search and review of related articles in the literature were conducted. The chosen works were analyzed according to the morphology of devices, the data acquisition systems, the outcome generation method, and the focus of intervention (assessment and/or training). Finally, a series of guidelines and challenges that must be considered when designing and implementing fully-automated robot-aided systems for the assessment of UL spasticity are summarized.","de-la-Torre, OÃƒÂ±a, Balaguer, JardÃƒÂ³n","https://doi.org/10.3390/s20185251","20201029","assessment; cooperative robots; robot-assisted rehabilitation; spasticity; upper limb","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16171,""
"A Web Application for Adrenal Incidentaloma Identification, Tracking, and Management Using Machine Learning","Incidental radiographic findings, such as adrenal nodules, are commonly identified in imaging studies and documented in radiology reports. However, patients with such findings frequently do not receive appropriate follow-up, partially due to the lack of tools for the management of such findings and the time required to maintain up-to-date lists. Natural language processing (NLP) is capable of extracting information from free-text clinical documents and could provide the basis for software solutions that do not require changes to clinical workflows. In this manuscript we present (1) a machine learning algorithm we trained to identify radiology reports documenting the presence of a newly discovered adrenal incidentaloma, and (2) the web application and results database we developed to manage these clinical findings. We manually annotated a training corpus of 4,090 radiology reports from across our institution with a binary label indicating whether or not a report contains a <i>newly discovered</i> adrenal incidentaloma. We trained a convolutional neural network to perform this text classification task. Over the NLP backbone we built a web application that allows users to coordinate clinical management of adrenal incidentalomas in real time. The annotated dataset included 404 positive (9.9%) and 3,686 (90.1%) negative reports. Our model achieved a sensitivity of 92.9% (95% confidence interval: 80.9-97.5%), a positive predictive value of 83.0% (69.9-91.1)%, a specificity of 97.8% (95.8-98.9)%, and an F1 score of 87.6%. We developed a front-end web application based on the model's output. Developing an NLP-enabled custom web application for tracking and management of high-risk adrenal incidentalomas is feasible in a resource constrained, safety net hospital. Such applications can be used by an institution's quality department or its primary care providers and can easily be generalized to other types of clinical findings.","Bala, Steinkamp, Feeney, Gupta, Sharma, Kantrowitz, Cordella, Moses, Drake","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1715892","20201022","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16172,""
"Identification of Risk Factors and Symptoms of COVID-19: Analysis of Biomedical Literature and Social Media Data","In December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak started in China and rapidly spread around the world. Lack of a vaccine or optimized intervention raised the importance of characterizing risk factors and symptoms for the early identification and successful treatment of patients with COVID-19. This study aims to investigate and analyze biomedical literature and public social media data to understand the association of risk factors and symptoms with the various outcomes observed in patients with COVID-19. Through semantic analysis, we collected 45 retrospective cohort studies, which evaluated 303 clinical and demographic variables across 13 different outcomes of patients with COVID-19, and 84,140 Twitter posts from 1036 COVID-19-positive users. Machine learning tools to extract biomedical information were introduced to identify mentions of uncommon or novel symptoms in tweets. We then examined and compared two data sets to expand our landscape of risk factors and symptoms related to COVID-19. From the biomedical literature, approximately 90% of clinical and demographic variables showed inconsistent associations with COVID-19 outcomes. Consensus analysis identified 72 risk factors that were specifically associated with individual outcomes. From the social media data, 51 symptoms were characterized and analyzed. By comparing social media data with biomedical literature, we identified 25 novel symptoms that were specifically mentioned in tweets but have been not previously well characterized. Furthermore, there were certain combinations of symptoms that were frequently mentioned together in social media. Identified outcome-specific risk factors, symptoms, and combinations of symptoms may serve as surrogate indicators to identify patients with COVID-19 and predict their clinical outcomes in order to provide appropriate treatments.","Jeon, Baruah, Sarabadani, Palanica","https://doi.org/10.2196/20509","20201009","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Twitter; biomedical literature; diagnosis; risk factor; social media; symptom; treatment; tweets; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Data Collection; Diarrhea; Disease Outbreaks; Dyspnea; Fatigue; Fever; Headache; Humans; Machine Learning; Myalgia; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Publications; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Social Media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16173,""
"Artificial Intelligence for the Prediction of Helicobacter Pylori Infection in Endoscopic Images: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Of Diagnostic Test Accuracy","Helicobacter pylori plays a central role in the development of gastric cancer, and prediction of H pylori infection by visual inspection of the gastric mucosa is an important function of endoscopy. However, there are currently no established methods of optical diagnosis of H pylori infection using endoscopic images. Definitive diagnosis requires endoscopic biopsy. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly adopted in clinical practice, especially for image recognition and classification. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic test accuracy of AI for the prediction of H pylori infection using endoscopic images. Two independent evaluators searched core databases. The inclusion criteria included studies with endoscopic images of H pylori infection and with application of AI for the prediction of H pylori infection presenting diagnostic performance. Systematic review and diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis were performed. Ultimately, 8 studies were identified. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the curve of AI for the prediction of H pylori infection were 0.87 (95% CI 0.72-0.94), 0.86 (95% CI 0.77-0.92), 40 (95% CI 15-112), and 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94), respectively, in the 1719 patients (385 patients with H pylori infection vs 1334 controls). Meta-regression showed methodological quality and included the number of patients in each study for the purpose of heterogeneity. There was no evidence of publication bias. The accuracy of the AI algorithm reached 82% for discrimination between noninfected images and posteradication images. An AI algorithm is a reliable tool for endoscopic diagnosis of H pylori infection. The limitations of lacking external validation performance and being conducted only in Asia should be overcome.

"Reporting of demographic data and representativeness in machine learning models using electronic health records","The development of machine learning (ML) algorithms to address a variety of issues faced in clinical practice has increased rapidly. However, questions have arisen regarding biases in their development that can affect their applicability in specific populations. We sought to evaluate whether studies developing ML models from electronic health record (EHR) data report sufficient demographic data on the study populations to demonstrate representativeness and reproducibility. We searched PubMed for articles applying ML models to improve clinical decision-making using EHR data. We limited our search to papers published between 2015 and 2019. Across the 164 studies reviewed, demographic variables were inconsistently reported and/or included as model inputs. Race/ethnicity was not reported in 64%; gender and age were not reported in 24% and 21% of studies, respectively. Socioeconomic status of the population was not reported in 92% of studies. Studies that mentioned these variables often did not report if they were included as model inputs. Few models (12%) were validated using external populations. Few studies (17%) open-sourced their code. Populations in the ML studies include higher proportions of White and Black yet fewer Hispanic subjects compared to the general US population. The demographic characteristics of study populations are poorly reported in the ML literature based on EHR data. Demographic representativeness in training data and model transparency is necessary to ensure that ML models are deployed in an equitable and reproducible manner.

The objective of this work is to develop and validate a case definition for frailty that can be used in a primary care electronic medical record database. This is a cross-sectional validation study using data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) in Southern Alberta. 52 CPCSSN sentinels assessed a random sample of their own patients using the Rockwood Clinical Frailty scale, resulting in a total of 875 patients to be used as reference standard. Patients must be over the age of 65 and have had a clinic visit within the last 24 months. The case definition for frailty was developed using machine learning methods using CPCSSN records for the 875 patients. Of the 875 patients, 155 (17.7%) were frail and 720 (84.2%) were not frail. Validation metrics of the case definition were: sensitivity and specificity of 0.28, 95% CI (0.21 to 0.36) and 0.94, 95% CI (0.93 to 0.96), respectively; PPV and NPV of 0.53, 95% CI (0.42 to 0.64) and 0.86, 95% CI (0.83 to 0.88), respectively. The low sensitivity and specificity results could be because frailty as a construct remains under-developed and relatively poorly understood due to its complex nature. These results contribute to the literature by demonstrating that case definitions for frailty require expert consensus and potentially more sophisticated algorithms to be successful.","Tyler Williamson, Aponte-Hao, Mele, Lethebe, Leduc, Thandi, Katz, Wong","https://doi.org/10.23889/ijpds.v5i1.1344","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16176,""
"Diagnostic concordance and discordance in digital pathology: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Digital pathology (DP) has the potential to fundamentally change the way that histopathology is practised, by streamlining the workflow, increasing efficiency, improving diagnostic accuracy and facilitating the platform for implementation of artificial intelligence-based computer-assisted diagnostics. Although the barriers to wider adoption of DP have been multifactorial, limited evidence of reliability has been a significant contributor. A meta-analysis to demonstrate the combined accuracy and reliability of DP is still lacking in the literature. We aimed to review the published literature on the diagnostic use of DP and to synthesise a statistically pooled evidence on safety and reliability of DP for routine diagnosis (primary and secondary) in the context of validation process. A comprehensive literature search was conducted through PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar for studies published between 2013 and August 2019. The search protocol identified all studies comparing DP with light microscopy (LM) reporting for diagnostic purposes, predominantly including H&amp;E-stained slides. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool evidence from the studies. Twenty-five studies were deemed eligible to be included in the review which examined a total of 10 410 histology samples (average sample size 176). For overall concordance (clinical concordance), the agreement percentage was 98.3% (95% CI 97.4 to 98.9) across 24 studies. A total of 546 major discordances were reported across 25 studies. Over half (57%) of these were related to assessment of nuclear atypia, grading of dysplasia and malignancy. These were followed by challenging diagnoses (26%) and identification of small objects (16%). The results of this meta-analysis indicate equivalent performance of DP in comparison with LM for routine diagnosis. Furthermore, the results provide valuable information concerning the areas of diagnostic discrepancy which may warrant particular attention in the transition to DP.","Azam, Miligy, Kimani, Maqbool, Hewitt, Rajpoot, Snead","https://doi.org/10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206764","20200916","diagnosis; diagnostic techniques and procedures; pathology; surgical; telepathology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16177,""
"Why Do Consumers Make Green Purchase Decisions? Insights from a Systematic Review","In order to achieve sustainable development to protect the environment and society, an increasing number of scholars have conducted in-depth research on green marketing and green purchases. Although great achievements have been made in this field, there still is room for further progress. This study reviews 97 papers providing empirical research on green purchase behavior from 2015 to 2020. First, we review the widely used consumer theory and its extended application in recent years. Second, we divide the influencing factors of green purchase behavior into the following three categories and discuss them in detail: individual factors, product attributes and marketing, and social factors. Finally, we put forward the following possible directions for future research. (1) The authors can consider adjustment to the survey objects to weaken the subjectivity of the data. (2) Longitudinal research can be used to assess the impact of education and policies with a lagging effect on consumers. (3) The authors can broaden the research direction towards a cross-cultural background. (4) The behavior of various green products (such as recyclable tires, recycled glass containers, recycled paper) could be explored to enrich the research content. (5) It will be beneficial to combine a variety of consumer theories to explore the green purchase behavior of consumers and break through the existing linear hypothesis path to explore new research methods.","Zhang, Dong","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186607","20201030","consumer theory; determinants of green purchase; green purchase; literature review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16178,""
"Texture Analysis of Three-Dimensional MRI Images May Differentiate Borderline and Malignant Epithelial Ovarian Tumors","To explore the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based whole tumor texture analysis in differentiating borderline epithelial ovarian tumors (BEOTs) from FIGO stage I/II malignant epithelial ovarian tumors (MEOTs). A total of 88 patients with histopathologically confirmed ovarian epithelial tumors after surgical resection, including 30 BEOT and 58 MEOT patients, were divided into a training group (n = 62) and a test group (n = 26). The clinical and conventional MRI features were retrospectively reviewed. The texture features of tumors, based on T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, were extracted using MaZda software and the three top weighted texture features were selected by using the Random Forest algorithm. A non-texture logistic regression model in the training group was built to include those clinical and conventional MRI variables with <i>p</i> value &lt; 0.10. Subsequently, a combined model integrating non-texture information and texture features was built for the training group. The model, evaluated using patients in the training group, was then applied to patients in the test group. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the diagnostic performance of the models. The combined model showed superior performance in categorizing BEOTs and MEOTs (sensitivity, 92.5%; specificity, 86.4%; accuracy, 90.3%; area under the ROC curve [AUC], 0.962) than the non-texture model (sensitivity, 78.3%; specificity, 84.6%; accuracy, 82.3%; AUC, 0.818). The AUCs were statistically different (<i>p</i> value = 0.038). In the test group, the AUCs, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 0.840, 73.3%, 90.1%, and 80.8% when the non-texture model was used and 0.896, 75.0%, 94.0%, and 88.5% when the combined model was used. MRI-based texture features combined with clinical and conventional MRI features may assist in differentitating between BEOT and FIGO stage I/II MEOT patients.","Ye, Weng, Li, Yan, Chen, Zhu, Wen","https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2020.0121","20200915","Borderline ovarian tumor; Differential diagnosis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Malignant epithelial ovarian tumor; Texture analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16179,""
"A Magnetic Resonance Imaging Radiomics Signature to Distinguish Benign From Malignant Orbital Lesions","Distinguishing benign from malignant orbital lesions remains challenging both clinically and with imaging, leading to risky biopsies. The objective was to differentiate benign from malignant orbital lesions using radiomics on 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. This institutional review board-approved prospective single-center study enrolled consecutive patients presenting with an orbital lesion undergoing a 3 T MRI prior to surgery from December 2015 to July 2019. Radiomics features were extracted from 6 MRI sequences (T1-weighted images [WIs], DIXON-T2-WI, diffusion-WI, postcontrast DIXON-T1-WI) using the Pyradiomics software. Features were selected based on their intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility, nonredundancy, and with a sequential step forward feature selection method. Selected features were used to train and optimize a Random Forest algorithm on the training set (75%) with 5-fold cross-validation. Performance metrics were computed on a held-out test set (25%) with bootstrap 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Five residents, 4 general radiologists, and 3 expert neuroradiologists were evaluated on their ability to visually distinguish benign from malignant lesions on the test set. Performance comparisons between reader groups and the model were performed using McNemar test. The impact of clinical and categorizable imaging data on algorithm performance was also assessed. A total of 200 patients (116 [58%] women and 84 [42%] men; mean age, 53.0 Ã‚Â± 17.9 years) with 126 of 200 (63%) benign and 74 of 200 (37%) malignant orbital lesions were included in the study. A total of 606 radiomics features were extracted. The best performing model on the training set was composed of 8 features including apparent diffusion coefficient mean value, maximum diameter on T1-WIs, and texture features. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity on the test set were respectively 0.869 (95% CI, 0.834-0.898), 0.840 (95% CI, 0.806-0.874), 0.684 (95% CI, 0.615-0.751), and 0.935 (95% CI, 0.905-0.961). The radiomics model outperformed all reader groups, including expert neuroradiologists (P &lt; 0.01). Adding clinical and categorizable imaging data did not significantly impact the algorithm performance (P = 0.49). An MRI radiomics signature is helpful in differentiating benign from malignant orbital lesions and may outperform expert radiologists.","Duron, Heraud, Charbonneau, Zmuda, Savatovsky, Fournier, Lecler","https://doi.org/10.1097/RLI.0000000000000722","20200915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16180,""
"Automatic Segmentation and Visualization of Choroid in OCT with Knowledge Infused Deep Learning","The choroid provides oxygen and nourishment to the outer retina thus is related to the pathology of various ocular diseases. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is advantageous in visualizing and quantifying the choroid in vivo, because it does not suffer from the information contamination of the inner retina in fundus photography and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, and the resolution deficiency in ocular ultrasound. However, its application in the study of the choroid is still limited for two reasons. (1) The lower boundary of the choroid (choroid-sclera interface) in OCT is fuzzy, which makes the automatic segmentation difficult and inaccurate. (2) The visualization of the choroid is hindered by the vessel shadows from the superficial layers of the inner retina. In this paper, we propose to incorporate medical and imaging prior knowledge with deep learning to address these two problems. We propose a biomarker infused global-to-local network, for the choroid segmentation. It leverages the thickness of the choroid layer, which is a primary biomarker in clinic, as a constraint to improve the segmentation accuracy. We also design a global-to-local strategy in the choroid segmentation: a global module is used to segment all the retinal and choroidal layers simultaneously for suppressing overfitting and providing global structure information, then a local module is used to refine the segmentation with the biomarker infusion. For eliminating the retinal vessel shadows, we propose a deep learning pipeline, which firstly use anatomical and OCT imaging knowledge to locate the shadows using their projection on the retinal pigment epthelium layer, then the contents of the choroidal vasculature at the shadow locations are predicted with an edge-to-texture two-stage generative adversarial inpainting network. The experiments shows the proposed method outperforms the existing methods on both the segmentation and shadow elimination tasks. We further apply the proposed method in a clinical prospective study for understanding the pathology of glaucoma, which demonstrates its capacity in detecting the structure and vascular changes of the choroid related to the elevation of intra-ocular pressure.","Zhang, Yang, Zhou, Li, Hu, Zhao, Zheng, Zhang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.3023144","20200915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16181,""
"Resilience of clinical text de-identified with &quot;hiding in plain sight&quot; to hostile reidentification attacks by human readers","Effective, scalable de-identification of personally identifying information (PII) for information-rich clinical text is critical to support secondary use, but no method is 100% effective. The hiding-in-plain-sight (HIPS) approach attempts to solve this &quot;residual PII problem.&quot; HIPS replaces PII tagged by a de-identification system with realistic but fictitious (resynthesized) content, making it harder to detect remaining unredacted PII. Using 2000 representative clinical documents from 2 healthcare settings (4000 total), we used a novel method to generate 2 de-identified 100-document corpora (200 documents total) in which PII tagged by a typical automated machine-learned tagger was replaced by HIPS-resynthesized content. Four readers conducted aggressive reidentification attacks to isolate leaked PII: 2 readers from within the originating institution and 2 external readers. Overall, mean recall of leaked PII was 26.8% and mean precision was 37.2%. Mean recall was 9% (mean precision = 37%) for patient ages, 32% (mean precision = 26%) for dates, 25% (mean precision = 37%) for doctor names, 45% (mean precision = 55%) for organization names, and 23% (mean precision = 57%) for patient names. Recall was 32% (precision = 40%) for internal and 22% (precision =33%) for external readers. Approximately 70% of leaked PII &quot;hiding&quot; in a corpus de-identified with HIPS resynthesis is resilient to detection by human readers in a realistic, aggressive reidentification attack scenario-more than double the rate reported in previous studies but less than the rate reported for an attack assisted by machine learning methods.","Carrell, Malin, Cronkite, Aberdeen, Clark, Li, Bastakoty, Nyemba, Hirschman","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa095","20201001","biomedical research; confidentiality; de-identification; electronic health records; natural language processing; privacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16182,""
"Machine Learning-Based MRI Texture Analysis to Predict the Histologic Grade of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma","<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> This study aimed to explore the performance of machine learning (ML)-based MRI texture analysis in discriminating between well-differentiated (WD) oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and moderately or poorly differentiated OSCC. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> The study enrolled 80 patients with pathologically confirmed OSCC (18 WD OSCCs and 62 moderately or poorly differentiated OSCCs) who underwent pretreatment MRI. ROIs were manually delineated to cover the entire tumor to the greatest possible extent on T2-weighted imaging and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, and 1118 texture features were extracted. Dimension reduction was performed using reproducibility analysis by two radiologists, collinearity analysis, and feature selection with a minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance algorithm. Models were created using random forest (RF), artificial neural network, and logistic regression (LR) alone and with a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Classifier performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation. <b>RESULTS.</b> Dimension reduction steps yielded eight texture features, including four features from each sequence. None of the clinical variables was selected. Among the eight texture features, five and seven texture features showed significant differences between the two groups in the actual data and balanced data, respectively (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). All classifiers with SMOTE achieved better performances than those alone. The RF classifier with SMOTE achieved the best performance with an area under the ROC curve of 0.936 and accuracy of 86.3%. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> ML-based MRI texture analysis provides a promising noninvasive approach for predicting the histologic grade of OSCC.","Ren, Qi, Yuan, Duan, Tao","https://doi.org/10.2214/AJR.19.22593","20201022","MRI; head and neck cancer; machine learning; texture analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16183,""
"Effectiveness and safety of herbal medicine for cancer-related fatigue in lung cancer survivors: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Approximately half of lung cancer patients (LCP) receiving chemotherapy are experiencing cancer-related fatigue (CRF). In East Asia, herbal medicines (HMs) have been used as tonics due to their anti-fatigue effect. This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness and safety of HMs for CRF in LCP. We comprehensively searched 12 electronic medical databases to search randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs investigating HMs for CRF in LCP, published up to September 2019. The primary outcome was the fatigue severity. Secondary outcomes included patients' quality of life (QOL), activities of daily life (ADL), and incidence of adverse events. Cochrane's risk of bias tool assessed the methodological quality of included RCTs. The risk ratio or mean difference was estimated with 95% confidence intervals by performing a meta-analysis. Twelve RCTs with 861 participants were included. Compared to conventional medicine alone, HM combined with conventional medicine significantly improved fatigue level, QOL, and ADL. As monotherapy, HM significantly improved ADL compared with megestrol. No serious HM-related adverse events were reported. Limited evidence suggests that HM could be effective and safe for CRF in LCP. However, further high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm these findings owing to the small number and low methodological quality of the included studies.","Kwon, Lee, Kong, Lee, Jung, Kim, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.6860","20200915","fatigue; herbal medicine; lung neoplasms; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16184,""
"A systematic literature review of automatic Alzheimer's disease detection from speech and language","In recent years numerous studies have achieved promising results in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection using automatic language processing. We systematically review these articles to understand the effectiveness of this approach, identify any issues and report the main findings that can guide further research. We searched PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Science for articles published in English between 2013 and 2019. We performed a systematic literature review to answer 5 key questions: (1) What were the characteristics of participant groups? (2) What language data were collected? (3) What features of speech and language were the most informative? (4) What methods were used to classify between groups? (5) What classification performance was achieved? We identified 33 eligible studies and 5 main findings: participants' demographic variables (especially age ) were often unbalanced between AD and control group; spontaneous speech data were collected most often; informative language features were related to word retrieval and semantic, syntactic, and acoustic impairment; neural nets, support vector machines, and decision trees performed well in AD detection, and support vector machines and decision trees performed well in decline detection; and average classification accuracy was 89% in AD and 82% in mild cognitive impairment detection versus healthy control groups. The systematic literature review supported the argument that language and speech could successfully be used to detect dementia automatically.

"Electronic health record-based disease surveillance systems: A systematic literature review on challenges and solutions","Disease surveillance systems are expanding using electronic health records (EHRs). However, there are many challenges in this regard. In the present study, the solutions and challenges of implementing EHR-based disease surveillance systems (EHR-DS) have been reviewed. We searched the related keywords in ProQuest, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Scopus. Then, we assessed and selected articles using the inclusion and exclusion criteria and, finally, classified the identified solutions and challenges. Finally, 50 studies were included, and 52 unique solutions and 47 challenges were organized into 6 main themes (policy and regulatory, technical, management, standardization, financial, and data quality). The results indicate that due to the multifaceted nature of the challenges, the implementation of EHR-DS is not low cost and easy to implement and requires a variety of interventions. On the one hand, the most common challenges include the need to invest significant time and resources; the poor data quality in EHRs; difficulty in analyzing, cleaning, and accessing unstructured data; data privacy and security; and the lack of interoperability standards. On the other hand, the most common solutions are the use of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms for unstructured data; the use of appropriate technical solutions for data retrieval, extraction, identification, and visualization; the collaboration of health and clinical departments to access data; standardizing EHR content for public health; and using a unique health identifier for individuals. EHR systems have an important role in modernizing disease surveillance systems.

"Untargeted metabolomics yields insight into ALS disease mechanisms","To identify dysregulated metabolic pathways in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) versus control participants through untargeted metabolomics. Untargeted metabolomics was performed on plasma from ALS participants (n=125) around 6.8 months after diagnosis and healthy controls (n=71). Individual differential metabolites in ALS cases versus controls were assessed by Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, adjusted logistic regression and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), while group lasso explored sub-pathway-level differences. Adjustment parameters included sex, age and body mass index (BMI). Metabolomics pathway enrichment analysis was performed on metabolites selected by the above methods. Finally, machine learning classification algorithms applied to group lasso-selected metabolites were evaluated for classifying case status. There were no group differences in sex, age and BMI. Significant metabolites selected were 303 by Wilcoxon, 300 by logistic regression, 295 by PLS-DA and 259 by group lasso, corresponding to 11, 13, 12 and 22 enriched sub-pathways, respectively. 'Benzoate metabolism', 'ceramides', 'creatine metabolism', 'fatty acid metabolism (acyl carnitine, polyunsaturated)' and 'hexosylceramides' sub-pathways were enriched by all methods, and 'sphingomyelins' by all but Wilcoxon, indicating these pathways significantly associate with ALS. Finally, machine learning prediction of ALS cases using group lasso-selected metabolites achieved the best performance by regularised logistic regression with elastic net regularisation, with an area under the curve of 0.98 and specificity of 83%. In our analysis, ALS led to significant metabolic pathway alterations, which had correlations to known ALS pathomechanisms in the basic and clinical literature, and may represent important targets for future ALS therapeutics.","Goutman, Boss, Guo, Alakwaa, Patterson, Kim, Savelieff, Hur, Feldman","https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2020-323611","20201030","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16187,""

"Application of hierarchical clustering to multi-parametric MR in prostate: Differentiation of tumor and normal tissue with high accuracy","Hierarchical clustering (HC), an unsupervised machine learning (ML) technique, was applied to multi-parametric MR (mp-MR) for prostate cancer (PCa). The aim of this study is to demonstrate HC can diagnose PCa in a straightforward interpretable way, in contrast to deep learning (DL) techniques. HC was constructed using mp-MR including intravoxel incoherent motion, diffusion kurtosis imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI from 40 tumor and normal tissues in peripheral zone (PZ) and 23 tumor and normal tissues in transition zone (TZ). HC model was optimized by assessing the combinations of several dissimilarity and linkage methods. Goodness of HC model was validated by internal methods. Accuracy for differentiating tumor and normal tissue by optimal HC model was 96.3% in PZ and 97.8% in TZ, comparable to current clinical standards. Relationship between input (DWI and permeability parameters) and output (tumor and normal tissue cluster) was shown by heat maps, consistent with literature. HC can accurately differentiate PCa and normal tissue, comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion based parameters. Contrary to DL techniques, HC is an operator-independent ML technique producing results that can be interpreted such that the results can be knowledgeably judged.","Akamine, Ueda, Ueno, Sofue, Murakami, Yoneyama, Obara, Van Cauteren","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mri.2020.09.011","20201023","Cluster analysis; Hierarchical clustering; Interpretability; Machine learning; Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging; Prostate cancer","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16189,""
"The utility of automated volume analysis of renal stones before and after shockwave lithotripsy treatment","This study aimed to evaluate the additional utility of an automated method of estimating volume for stones being treated with shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) using computed tomography (CT) images compared to manual measurement. Utility was assessed as the ability to accurately measure stone burden before andÃ‚Â after SWL treatment, and whether stone volume is a better predictor of SWL outcome than stone diameter. 72 patients treated with SWL for a renal stone with available CT scans before and after treatment were included. Stone axesÃ‚Â measurement and volume estimation using ellipsoid equations were compared to volume estimationÃ‚Â using software usingÃ‚Â CT textural analysis (CTTA) of stone images. There was strong correlation (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.8) between manual and CTTA estimated stone volume. CTTA measured stone volume showed the highest predictive value (r<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.217) for successful SWL outcome on binary logistic regression analysis. Three cases that were originally classified as 'stone-free with clinically insignificant residual fragments' based on manual axis measurements actuallyÃ‚Â had a larger stone volume based on CTTA estimation than the smallest fragments remaining for cases with an outcome of 'not stone-free'. This study suggestsÃ‚Â objective measurement of total stone volume could improve estimation of stone burden before and after treatment. Current definitions of stone-free status based on manual measurements of residual fragment sizes are not accurate and may underestimate remaining stone burden after treatment.

A case report. A 32-year-old man presented with severe corneal hydrops in OS. He was treated conservatively with hypertonic saline. Serial AS-OCT revealed persistent edema and haze overlying a break in DM, with a ridge of protruding tissue on either side. Based on these findings, UT-DSAEK was performed. Intraoperatively, the ridge of tissue remained firmly adhered after DM removal and was felt to possibly represent posterior stroma. The patient's uncorrected visual acuity improved to 20/80. Literature review revealed 1 case with similar AS-OCT findings who underwent penetrating keratoplasty; histopathology was reported to show Descemet scrolls on either side of the break, but our analysis of this and other reports suggest that an additional layer of tissue is contained within the scroll along with DM. This case demonstrates severe corneal hydrops in the setting of keratoconus, in which AS-OCT revealed a ridge of protruding tissue on either side of a break in DM. UT-DSAEK led to resolution of corneal edema and improvement in stromal haze and visual acuity. Further research is required to determine the precise role of endothelial keratoplasty and potential role of posterior stromal rupture in some cases of acute corneal hydrops.","Blitzer, Liles, Harocopos, Reidy, Farooq","https://doi.org/10.1097/ICO.0000000000002464","20200914","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16191,""
"Application of ultrasound-guided biopsy and percutaneous radiofrequency ablation in 2 cases with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor and literature review","Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a vanishingly rare paraneoplastic syndrome which is usually caused by phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors (PMTs). The conventional treatment for PMTs is total resection, and ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can also be used for the treatment of PMTs patients, especially for patients in whom complete resection may lead to serious complications. We report two cases with PMT who presented syndrome with progressive musculoskeletal complaints and performed ultrasound-guided biopsy and RFA. Ultrasound-guided RFA, which is a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment option, appears to be a valuable alternative to surgery for patients presenting with PMT. We are the first reported case of RFA guided by ultrasonography in the treatment of PMT.","Xian, Pan, Zhang, Cheng, Huang, Chen, Zhao, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3233/CH-200921","20201026","Tumor-induced osteomalacia; oncogenic osteomalacia; phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor; radiofrequency ablation; ultrasound","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16192,""
"Artificial Intelligence-Based Conversational Agents for Chronic Conditions: Systematic Literature Review","A rising number of conversational agents or chatbots are equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) architecture. They are increasingly prevalent in health care applications such as those providing education and support to patients with chronic diseases, one of the leading causes of death in the 21st century. AI-based chatbots enable more effective and frequent interactions with such patients. The goal of this systematic literature review is to review the characteristics, health care conditions, and AI architectures of AI-based conversational agents designed specifically for chronic diseases. We conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, PyscInfo, CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. We applied a predefined search strategy using the terms &quot;conversational agent,&quot; &quot;healthcare,&quot; &quot;artificial intelligence,&quot; and their synonyms. We updated the search results using Google alerts, and screened reference lists for other relevant articles. We included primary research studies that involved the prevention, treatment, or rehabilitation of chronic diseases, involved a conversational agent, and included any kind of AI architecture. Two independent reviewers conducted screening and data extraction, and Cohen kappa was used to measure interrater agreement.A narrative approach was applied for data synthesis. The literature search found 2052 articles, out of which 10 papers met the inclusion criteria. The small number of identified studies together with the prevalence of quasi-experimental studies (n=7) and prevailing prototype nature of the chatbots (n=7) revealed the immaturity of the field. The reported chatbots addressed a broad variety of chronic diseases (n=6), showcasing a tendency to develop specialized conversational agents for individual chronic conditions. However, there lacks comparison of these chatbots within and between chronic diseases. In addition, the reported evaluation measures were not standardized, and the addressed health goals showed a large range. Together, these study characteristics complicated comparability and open room for future research. While natural language processing represented the most used AI technique (n=7) and the majority of conversational agents allowed for multimodal interaction (n=6), the identified studies demonstrated broad heterogeneity, lack of depth of reported AI techniques and systems, and inconsistent usage of taxonomy of the underlying AI software, further aggravating comparability and generalizability of study results. The literature on AI-based conversational agents for chronic conditions is scarce and mostly consists of quasi-experimental studies with chatbots in prototype stage that use natural language processing and allow for multimodal user interaction. Future research could profit from evidence-based evaluation of the AI-based conversational agents and comparison thereof within and between different chronic health conditions. Besides increased comparability, the quality of chatbots developed for specific chronic conditions and their subsequent impact on the target patients could be enhanced by more structured development and standardized evaluation processes.","Schachner, Keller, V Wangenheim","https://doi.org/10.2196/20701","20201020","artificial intelligence; chatbots; chronic diseases; conversational agents; healthcare; systematic literature review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16193,""
"Natural language processing for automated quantification of bone metastases reported in free-text bone scintigraphy reports","The widespread use of electronic patient-generated health data has led to unprecedented opportunities for automated extraction of clinical features from free-text medical notes. However, processing this rich resource of data for clinical and research purposes, depends on labor-intensive and potentially error-prone manual review. The aim of this study was to develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm for binary classification (single metastasis versus two or more metastases) in bone scintigraphy reports of patients undergoing surgery for bone metastases. Bone scintigraphy reports of patients undergoing surgery for bone metastases were labeled each by three independent reviewers using a binary classification (single metastasis versus two or more metastases) to establish a ground truth. A stratified 80:20 split was used to develop and test an extreme-gradient boosting supervised machine learning NLP algorithm. A total of 704 free-text bone scintigraphy reports from 704 patients were included in this study and 617 (88%) had multiple bone metastases. In the independent test set (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°141) not used for model development, the NLP algorithm achieved an 0.97 AUC-ROC (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-0.99) for classification of multiple bone metastases and an 0.99 AUC-PRC (95% CI, 0.99-0.99). At a threshold of 0.90, NLP algorithm correctly identified multiple bone metastases in 117 of the 124 who had multiple bone metastases in the testing cohort (sensitivity 0.94) and yielded 3 false positives (specificity 0.82). At the same threshold, the NLP algorithm had a positive predictive value of 0.97 and F1-score of 0.96. NLP has the potential to automate clinical data extraction from free text radiology notes in orthopedics, thereby optimizing the speed, accuracy, and consistency of clinical chart review. Pending external validation, the NLP algorithm developed in this study may be implemented as a means to aid researchers in tackling large amounts of data.","Groot, Bongers, Karhade, Kapoor, Fenn, Kim, Verlaan, Schwab","https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186X.2020.1819563","20200917","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16194,""
"Drones for Automated External Defibrillator Delivery: Where Do We Stand?","Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is an important cause of mortality and disability worldwide. The health care community hoped that, with the development of the automated external defibrillator (AED), the mortality and functional outcomes of patients with OHCAs would improve. Despite their effectiveness, their use in OHCA has not yet become common practice. Unfortunately, in 18-59% of cases, public access AEDs were deemed to be in poorly accessible areas or not available all of the time. We present the existing literature on the implementation of drone delivery of AEDs to improve the response time of the emergency medical services. Test flights and mathematical/geographic models have been used to assess the effectiveness of drones in delivering AEDs to patients with OHCA. The results of those studies showed promising outcomes given that drone usage led to improved delivery times of AEDs compared with emergency medical services delivery. While drones have the potential to dramatically improve cardiac arrest patient care, further studies are needed to evaluate their effectiveness in real-life clinical scenarios.","Mermiri, Mavrovounis, Pantazopoulos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.07.027","20200914","aircraft; cardiac arrest; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; drone; emergency medicine; out-of-hospital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16195,""
"Review of medical image recognition technologies to detect melanomas using neural networks","Melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of cancer that has become a world-class problem. According to the World Health Organization estimates, 132,000 cases of the disease and 66,000 deaths from malignant melanoma and other forms of skin cancer are reported annually worldwide ( https://apps.who.int/gho/data/?theme=main ) and those numbers continue to grow. In our opinion, due to the increasing incidence of the disease, it is necessary to find new, easy to use and sensitive methods for the early diagnosis of melanoma in a large number of people around the world. Over the last decade, neural networks show highly sensitive, specific, and accurate results. This study presents a review of PubMed papers including requests Ã‚Â«melanoma neural networkÃ‚Â» and Ã‚Â«melanoma neural network dermatoscopyÃ‚Â». We review recent researches and discuss their opportunities acceptable in clinical practice. We searched the PubMed database for systematic reviews and original research papers on the requests Ã‚Â«melanoma neural networkÃ‚Â» and Ã‚Â«melanoma neural network dermatoscopyÃ‚Â» published in English. Only papers that reported results, progress and outcomes are included in this review. We found 11 papers that match our requests that observed convolutional and deep-learning neural networks combined with fuzzy clustering or World Cup Optimization algorithms in analyzing dermatoscopic images. All of them require an ABCD (asymmetry, border, color, and differential structures) algorithm and its derivates (in combination with ABCD algorithm or separately). Also, they require a large dataset of dermatoscopic images and optimized estimation parameters to provide high specificity, accuracy and sensitivity. According to the analyzed papers, neural networks show higher specificity, accuracy and sensitivity than dermatologists. Neural networks are able to evaluate features that might be unavailable to the naked human eye. Despite that, we need more datasets to confirm those statements. Nowadays machine learning becomes a helpful tool in early diagnosing skin diseases, especially melanoma.","Efimenko, Ignatev, Koshechkin","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-03615-1","20201001","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning neural network; Fuzzy clustering algorithm; Melanoma classification; Skin cancer","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16196,""

"Aphasia and acquired reading impairments: What are the high-tech alternatives to compensate for reading deficits?","People with aphasia (PWA) frequently present impairments in reading comprehension. Such impairments can be particularly debilitating due to the limitations and constraints they impose on everyday life. Recent technological advancements in the field of information and communication technologies offer many compensative tools for PWA. However, most technological tools are designed for patients with speech production impairments. Instruments addressing reading impairments associated with aphasia remain scarce and underrepresented in the scientific literature. To conduct a state-of-the-art review of the technologies currently available to PWA and acquired reading impairments. In particular, this review covers (1) research on technologies explicitly developed to compensate for reading difficulties associated with aphasia; and (2) research into which accessibility features included in mainstream high-tech systems are helpful for PWA when trying to access written material. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) international standard, the authors conducted a systematic review from 2009 to 2019. The databases inspected were Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, the Cochrane collection, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and SpringerLink. Other research papers were included after checking the references of the selected papers. The review reveals that research on compensative devices for reading impairments largely neglects tools for individuals with aphasia and acquired reading difficulties. Most of the studies in this field are qualitative investigations of how patients with literacy difficulties tackle everyday tasks with the help of mainstream technology (e.g., smartphone applications). Therefore, this paper highlights the scarce high-tech alternatives that support text comprehension in PWA and acquired reading impairments, and suggests further work on the development of customized software for smartphones and personal computers. High-tech reading tools may help PWA to regain reading autonomy. PWA and acquired reading impairments employ a wide array of devices to overcome reading difficulties, which underlines the importance of reading in everyday life. However, the supports currently available are not yet flexible and accurate enough to answer their day-to-day needs. Thus, further work is necessary to enhance the compensative devices available to them. For instance, existing new technologies in the area of natural language processing (such as automatic text simplification) could potentially be used in compensative devices. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject Most research on high-tech compensative reading tools is focused on investigating how patients with aphasia and acquired reading impairments cope with their reading difficulties in everyday life by resorting to different types of technology. Yet, we still lack specific research on compensative reading technology for PWA. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This review shows that PWA with acquired reading impairments are offered limited options for accessing written content easily and autonomously-and those few resources that are available are not specifically designed for PWA. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Both aphasia and acquired reading impairments can vary in terms of both their severity and the associated typology of cognitive impairments. Therefore, it might be interesting to investigate flexible and highly adaptable reading support designed for them-and innovations in the field of information and communication technology might prove particularly fruitful.","Cistola, FarrÃƒÂºs, van der Meulen","https://doi.org/10.1111/1460-6984.12569","20200912","acquired reading impairments; alexia; aphasia; compensative tools; natural language processing technologies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16198,""
"Prediction of breast cancer-related outcomes with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale: A literature review","The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) is a validated tool used in patients with varied cancer diagnoses to measure patient symptoms. The present manuscript will review the literature assessing the ability of the ESAS to predict patient-related outcomes in breast cancer patients. A literature search was conducted of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases, Ovid MEDLINE, and Embase for English articles that investigated the use of predictive modelling with the ESAS in the breast cancer population. Study type, publication year, sample size, patient demographics, predicted outcomes, and strongest predictive factors/symptoms were summarized for each study. A total of nine articles were included in this review. Five articles used the ESAS in predictive models to determine patient time to death. ESAS was also used to predict emergency department visits, determine symptoms associated with decreased quality of life, and generate a Health Utility Score. Lack of appetite was the most common ESAS symptom, as it was reported in five studies to be associated with decreased survival. In four of the nine articles, an additional survey investigating physical functioning was used in combination with ESAS to strengthen the predictive models. Included studies support the use of ESAS in predictive models, particularly for predicting survival. Using the ESAS as a predictive tool allows for more accurate time to death predictions, potentially improving symptom management and preventing overtreatment of palliative patients near the end of life.","Milton, Behroozian, Coburn, Trudeau, Razvi, McKenzie, Karam, Lam, Chow","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05755-9","20200912","Breast cancer; Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale; Predictive modelling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16199,""
"To operate, or not to operate? Narrative review of the role of survival predictors in patient selection for operative management of patients with metastatic spine disease","Accurate prediction of patient survival is an essential component of the preoperative evaluation of patients with spinal metastases. Over the past quarter of a century, a number of predictors have been developed, although none have been accurate enough to be instituted as a staple of clinical practice. However, recently more comprehensive survival calculators have been published that make use of larger data sets and machine learning to predict postoperative survival among patients with spine metastases. Given the glut of calculators that have been published, the authors sought to perform a narrative review of the current literature, highlighting existing calculators along with the strengths and weaknesses of each. In doing so, they identify two &quot;generations&quot; of scoring systems-a first generation based on a priori factor weighting and a second generation comprising predictive tools that are developed using advanced statistical modeling and are focused on clinical deployment. In spite of recent advances, the authors found that most predictors have only a moderate ability to explain variation in patient survival. Second-generation models have a greater prognostic accuracy relative to first-generation scoring systems, but most still require external validation. Given this, it seems that there are two outstanding goals for these survival predictors, foremost being external validation of current calculators in multicenter prospective cohorts, as the majority have been developed from, and internally validated within, the same single-institution data sets. Lastly, current predictors should be modified to incorporate advances in targeted systemic therapy and radiotherapy, which have been heretofore largely ignored.","Pennington, Ehresman, Cottrill, Lubelski, Lehner, Feghali, Ahmed, Schilling, Sciubba","https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.6.SPINE20707","20200911","AUC = area under the curve; ECOG = Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; ESCC = epidural spinal cord compression; GSTSG = Global Spine Tumour Study Group; KPS = Karnofsky Performance Status; NESMS = New England Spinal Metastasis Score; NSQIP = National Surgical Quality Improvement Program; PPV = positive predictive value; QOL = quality of life; SORG = Skeletal Oncology Research Group; minimally invasive surgery; oncology; patient selection; predictive analytics; quality of life; spinal metastases; survival prediction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16200,""
"ADHD and ADHD-related neural networks in benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes: A systematic review","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS or rolandic epilepsy) present with a very high level of comorbidity. We aimed to review the existing literature focusing on two aspects: the possible role of epileptic activity in the damage of ADHD-related neural networks and the clinical approach to patients presenting with both conditions. A systematic review was performed using Sapienza Library System and PubMed. The following search terms have been considered: attention networks, ADHD, attention systems, rolandic epilepsy, benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, centrotemporal spikes epilepsy, and focal epilepsy in children. The target population consisted of patients under 18Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years of age diagnosed with either BECTS and ADHD or healthy controls. Nine case-control and cohort studies have been selected. The reported prevalence of ADHD in patients with BECTS was around 60%. No clinical correlation was found between the medical records and the presence of ADHD in patients with BECTS, if not due to febrile convulsion (FC). One study showed higher levels of bilateral discharges in patients with severe ADHD. The negative influence of the age at onset of seizures was demonstrated on attention but not on intelligence quotient (IQ). Moreover, the frequency of seizures and the occurrence of discharges during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep were correlated to attention impairment. From a neurobiological point of view, functional connectivity in patients with BECTS and ADHD appears to be disrupted. Two studies reported a specific impairment in selective visual attention, while one study underlined a decreased activation of the dorsal attention network (DAN). Two different studies found that patients with BECTS and comorbid ADHD presented with altered thickness in their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in the cortical and subcortical regions (including the frontal lobes, lingual-fusiform cortex, cuneus and precuneus, limbic area and pericalcarine cortex among others). This might explain the cognitive and behavioral symptoms such as poor selective visual attention, speech disturbance, and impulsivity. Despite BECTS being considered to have a relative benign course, many studies have documented cognitive and/or behavioral problems in patients diagnosed with this type of epilepsy. In particular, children affected by rolandic epilepsy should receive a complete neuropsychological evaluation at seizure onset considering the high rate of comorbidity with ADHD. A further investigation of the common pathogenic substrate is desirable to better orientate the clinical and therapeutic interventions applied.","AricÃƒÂ², Arigliani, Giannotti, Romani","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107448","20200929","Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Attention networks; Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS); Cognitive impairment; Neuropsychological profile","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16201,""
"Primary Tumors of the Posterior Pituitary Gland: A Systematic Review of the Literature in Light of the New 2017 World Health Organization Classification of Pituitary Tumors","The rare clinical entity of primary posterior pituitary tumors (PPTs) includes pituicytomas, granular cell tumors, spine cell oncocytomas, and sellar ependymomas. The recent World Health Organization classification of PPTs based on thyroid transcription factor 1 positivity has led to more investigations into the epidemiology, clinical presentation, nature history, histologic features, and operative characteristics of these tumors. The aim of this review is to summarize the characteristics of primary PPTs. Our summary involved an in-depth review of the literature on PPTs. Our systematic review was carried out using the PubMed database and PRISMA guidelines. An initial search identified 282 publications. After strict application of the inclusion criteria, we found 16 articles for case series of patients with primary PPT (N &gt; 5), which were included in our table for literature review. An additional 10 articles were review articles on PPTs published in the last 20 years and were used as resource for our systematic review. An extensive analysis was then performed to extract relevant clinical data with respect to the clinical radiologic histopathologic profile of primary PPTs and their treatment outcome. Primary PPTs are a rare group of pituicyte-derived low-grade nonneuroendocrine neoplasms that arise from the sellar region. The nondescript radiographic findings and subtle endocrine abnormalities also veil their accurate diagnostic prediction. As shown through the narrative as well as the literature review, there is still a lot to be understood about PPTs. A prospective multicenter registry of these rare tumors would benefit both the neurosurgical as well as the endocrinologic knowledge base.","Whipple, Savardekar, Rao, Mahadevan, Guthikonda, Kosty","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.09.023","20201101","Granular cell tumor; Infundibulum; Pituicytoma; Pituitary; Pituitary ependymoma; Posterior pituitary; Posterior pituitary tumors; Sellar ependymoma; Spindle cell oncocytoma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16202,""
"Inconsistency in the use of the term &quot;validation&quot; in studies reporting the performance of deep learning algorithms in providing diagnosis from medical imaging","The development of deep learning (DL) algorithms is a three-step process-training, tuning, and testing. Studies are inconsistent in the use of the term &quot;validation&quot;, with some using it to refer to tuning and others testing, which hinders accurate delivery of information and may inadvertently exaggerate the performance of DL algorithms. We investigated the extent of inconsistency in usage of the term &quot;validation&quot; in studies on the accuracy of DL algorithms in providing diagnosis from medical imaging. We analyzed the full texts of research papers cited in two recent systematic reviews. The papers were categorized according to whether the term &quot;validation&quot; was used to refer to tuning alone, both tuning and testing, or testing alone. We analyzed whether paper characteristics (i.e., journal category, field of study, year of print publication, journal impact factor [JIF], and nature of test data) were associated with the usage of the terminology using multivariable logistic regression analysis with generalized estimating equations. Of 201 papers published in 125 journals, 118 (58.7%), 9 (4.5%), and 74 (36.8%) used the term to refer to tuning alone, both tuning and testing, and testing alone, respectively. A weak association was noted between higher JIF and using the term to refer to testing (i.e., testing alone or both tuning and testing) instead of tuning alone (vs. JIF &lt;5; JIF 5 to 10: adjusted odds ratio 2.11, P = 0.042; JIF &gt;10: adjusted odds ratio 2.41, P = 0.089). Journal category, field of study, year of print publication, and nature of test data were not significantly associated with the terminology usage. Existing literature has a significant degree of inconsistency in using the term &quot;validation&quot; when referring to the steps in DL algorithm development. Efforts are needed to improve the accuracy and clarity in the terminology usage.","Kim, Jang, Ko, Son, Kim, Kim, Lim, Park","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238908","20201023","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16203,""

The mechanism itself has been realized in a variety of formats. However, because of the fast-paced advances in this domain, a systematic overview of attention is still missing. In this article, we define a unified model for attention architectures in natural language processing, with a focus on those designed to work with vector representations of the textual data. We propose a taxonomy of attention models according to four dimensions: the representation of the input, the compatibility function, the distribution function, and the multiplicity of the input and/or output. We present the examples of how prior information can be exploited in attention models and discuss ongoing research efforts and open challenges in the area, providing the first extensive categorization of the vast body of literature in this exciting domain.","Galassi, Lippi, Torroni","https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3019893","20200911","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16204,""
"Medical Student Training in eHealth: Scoping Review","eHealth is the use of information and communication technologies to enable and improve health and health care services. It is crucial that medical students receive adequate training in eHealth as they will work in clinical environments that are increasingly being enabled by technology. This trend is especially accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic as it complicates traditional face-to-face medical consultations and highlights the need for innovative approaches in health care. This review aims to evaluate the extent and nature of the existing literature on medical student training in eHealth. In detail, it aims to examine what this education consists of, the barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for improving the medical curriculum. This review focuses primarily on some key technologies such as mobile health (mHealth), the internet of things (IoT), telehealth, and artificial intelligence (AI). Searches were performed on 4 databases, and articles were selected based on the eligibility criteria. Studies had to be related to the training of medical students in eHealth. The eligibility criteria were studies published since 2014, from a peer-reviewed journal, and written in either English or French. A grid was used to extract and chart data. The search resulted in 25 articles. The most studied aspect was mHealth. eHealth as a broad concept, the IoT, AI, and programming were least covered. A total of 52% (13/25) of all studies contained an intervention, mostly regarding mHealth, electronic health records, web-based medical resources, and programming. The findings included various barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for improving the medical curriculum. Trends have emerged regarding the suboptimal present state of eHealth training and barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for optimal training. We recommend that additional studies be conducted on the following themes: barriers, enhancing factors, propositions for optimal training, competencies that medical students should acquire, learning outcomes from eHealth training, and patient care outcomes from this training. Additional studies should be conducted on eHealth and each of its aspects, especially on the IoT, AI, programming, and eHealth as a broad concept. Training in eHealth is critical to medical practice in clinical environments that are increasingly being enabled by technology. The need for innovative approaches in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic further highlights the relevance of this training.","Echelard, MÃƒÂ©thot, Nguyen, Pomey","https://doi.org/10.2196/20027","20201010","artificial intelligence; digital health; eHealth; electronic health records; health apps; internet of things; mHealth; medical education; programming; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16205,""
"Cost-Effectiveness of an Antibacterial Envelope for Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Infection Prevention in the US Healthcare System From the WRAP-IT Trial","In the WRAP-IT trial (Worldwide Randomized Antibiotic Envelope Infection Prevention), adjunctive use of an absorbable antibacterial envelope resulted in a 40% reduction of major cardiac implantable electronic device infection without increased risk of complication in 6983 patients undergoing cardiac implantable electronic device revision, replacement, upgrade, or initial cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator implant. There is limited information on the cost-effectiveness of this strategy. As a prespecified objective, we evaluated antibacterial envelope cost-effectiveness compared with standard-of-care infection prevention strategies in the US healthcare system. A decision tree model was used to compare costs and outcomes of antibacterial envelope (TYRX) use adjunctive to standard-of-care infection prevention versus standard-of-care alone over a lifelong time horizon. The analysis was performed from an integrated payer-provider network perspective. Infection rates, antibacterial envelope effectiveness, infection treatment costs and patterns, infection-related mortality, and utility estimates were obtained from the WRAP-IT trial. Life expectancy and long-term costs associated with device replacement, follow-up, and healthcare utilization were sourced from the literature. Costs and quality-adjusted life years were discounted at 3%. An upper willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000 per quality-adjusted life year was used to determine cost-effectiveness, in alignment with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association practice guidelines and as supported by the World Health Organization and contemporary literature. The base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the antibacterial envelope compared with standard-of-care was $112 603/quality-adjusted life year. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio remained lower than the willingness-to-pay threshold in 74% of iterations in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis and was most sensitive to the following model inputs: infection-related mortality, life expectancy, and infection cost. The absorbable antibacterial envelope was associated with a cost-effectiveness ratio below contemporary benchmarks in the WRAP-IT patient population, suggesting that the envelope provides value for the US healthcare system by reducing the incidence of cardiac implantable electronic device infection.

"Impact of Gene Biomarker Discovery Tools Based on Protein-Protein Interaction and Machine Learning on Performance of Artificial Intelligence Models in Predicting Clinical Stages of Breast Cancer","Breast cancer, as one of the most common diseases threatening the women's life, has attracted serious attention of the clinical and biomedical researchers worldwide. The genome-based studies along with their registered GEO datasets are frequent in the literature. Since several methodologies have been developed for analyzing and identifying gene biomarkers, it is necessary to evaluate their robustness. In this study, three well-known biomarker identification methods (i.e., ClusterOne, MCODE, and BioDiscML) were employed in order to identify the potential biomarkers. Then, the methods were ranked and evaluated using nonlinear classification models developed based on the identified sets of biomarkers. A combined BC microarray dataset consisting of GSE124647, GSE124646, and GSE15852 was used as training set, and two test datasets, GSE15852 and GSE25066, were used for the performance measurement of the trained models. The validation of the proposed models was carried out internally (leave-one-out, fivefold and tenfold cross-validation, random sampling, test on training set) and externally (test on test set). The results showed that ClusterOne, MCODE, and BioDiscML tools ranked first, second, and third, respectively, based on the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall metrics. Overall, it can be concluded that the descriptive values of gene biomarkers in terms of their biological aspects that have been determined by a given methodology and the predictive power of the models developed based on the identified gene biomarkers should be considered simultaneously while validating the biomarker identification approaches.","Amjad, Asnaashari, Sokouti, Dastmalchi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12539-020-00390-8","20200911","Artificial intelligence; Biomarker identification; Breast cancer; Gene; Machine learning; Staging system","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16207,""
"Automated detection of cribriform growth patterns in prostate histology images","Cribriform growth patterns in prostate carcinoma are associated with poor prognosis. We aimed to introduce a deep learning method to detect such patterns automatically. To do so, convolutional neural network was trained to detect cribriform growth patterns on 128 prostate needle biopsies. Ensemble learning taking into account other tumor growth patterns during training was used to cope with heterogeneous and limited tumor tissue occurrences. ROC and FROC analyses were applied to assess network performance regarding detection of biopsies harboring cribriform growth pattern. The ROC analysis yielded a mean area under the curve up to 0.81. FROC analysis demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.9 for regions larger than [Formula: see text] with on average 7.5 false positives. To benchmark method performance for intra-observer annotation variability, false positive and negative detections were re-evaluated by the pathologists. Pathologists considered 9% of the false positive regions as cribriform, and 11% as possibly cribriform; 44% of the false negative regions were not annotated as cribriform. As a final experiment, the network was also applied on a dataset of 60 biopsy regions annotated by 23 pathologists. With the cut-off reaching highest sensitivity, all images annotated as cribriform by at least 7/23 of the pathologists, were all detected as cribriform by the network and 9/60 of the images were detected as cribriform whereas no pathologist labelled them as such. In conclusion, the proposed deep learning method has high sensitivity for detecting cribriform growth patterns at the expense of a limited number of false positives. It can detect cribriform regions that are labelled as such by at least a minority of pathologists. Therefore, it could assist clinical decision making by suggesting suspicious regions.","Ambrosini, Hollemans, Kweldam, Leenders, Stallinga, Vos","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71942-7","20201027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16208,""

An efficient tool that can accurately recognize important clinical concepts of COVID-19 from free text in electronic health records will be significantly valuable to accelerate various applications of COVID-19 research. To this end, the existing clinical NLP tool CLAMP was quickly adapted to COVID-19 information and generated an automated tool called COVID-19 SignSym, which can extract and signs/symptoms and their eight attributes such as temporal information and negations from clinical text. The extracted information is also mapped to standard clinical concepts in the common data model of OHDSI OMOP. Evaluation on clinical notes and medical dialogues demonstrated promising results.

"The evolution of social health research topics: A data-driven analysis","The realm of social health has not yet been properly established in terms of fixed definitions, concepts, and research areas. This study attempts to define social health using macro and micro perspectives and explores trends in social health research by mapping their topics and fields. We used Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling, which allows the extraction of key terms and topics derived from a large volume of literature. We traced the evolution of research topics from past (the literature that &quot;present&quot; articles cited), present (existing journal articles on social health), to future (the literature which cited the articles) studies based on connections between citations. The datasets were collected by the query terms &quot;social health&quot; in the Scopus database, including title, abstract, and keywords of journal articles. We collected a total of 443 articles from recent social health literature, 6588 articles from past literature that the recent articles on social health cited, and 2680 articles from future literature in which recent social health articles were cited. We defined social health as positive interaction that increases individual engagement in social life at the micro level, and the high degree of social integration that deals with collective problems in society at the macro level. The results of LDA showed that social health research has developed into seven fields: Health Care Delivery; Vulnerable Groups; Measurement; Health Inequality; Social Network and Empowerment; Clinical/Physical Health; and Mental/Behavioral Health. Based on citation relationships, topics grounded in an individual/micro perspective have grown increasingly specialized and productive, while topics grounded in a social/macro perspective have stagnated or was underexplored. Our findings imply that social health studies should follow a more interdisciplinary approach to integrate current health models of individual-centered treatments with social science concerns on building collective capacity for social well-being.","Cho, Park, Song","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113299","20201102","Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA); Research trends; Scopus; Social health; Social health knowledge mapping; Social health knowledge summarization; Social health research area; Text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16216,""
"Logistic models and artificial intelligence in the sonographic assessment of adnexal masses - a systematic review of the literature","Adnexal masses are common, yet challenging, in gynecological practice. Making the differential diagnosis between their benign and malignant condition is essential for optimal surgical management, but reliable pre-surgical differentiation is sometimes difficult using clinical features, ultrasound examination, or tumor markers alone. A possible way to improve the diagnosis is using artificial intelligence (AI) or logistic models developed based on compiling and processing clinical, ultrasound, and tumor marker data together. Ample research has already been conducted in this regard that medical practitioners could benefit from. In this systematic review, we present logistic models and methods using AI, chosen based on their demonstrated high performance in clinical practice. Although some external validation of these models has been performed, further prospective studies are needed in order to select the best model or to create a new, more efficient, one for the pre-surgical evaluation of ovarian masses.","Grigore, Popovici, Gafitanu, Himiniuc, Murarasu, Micu","https://doi.org/10.11152/mu-2538","20200909","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16217,""

"Tumor Control Probability Modeling and Systematic Review of the Literature of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer","Dose escalation improves localized prostate cancer disease control, and moderately hypofractionated external beam radiation is noninferior to conventional fractionation. The evolving treatment approach of ultrahypofractionation with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) allows possible further biological dose escalation (biologically equivalent dose [BED]) and shortened treatment time. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine Working Group on Biological Effects of Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy/SBRT included a subgroup to study the prostate tumor control probability (TCP) with SBRT. We performed a systematic review of the available literature and created a dose-response TCP model for the endpoint of freedom from biochemical relapse. Results were stratified by prostate cancer risk group. Twenty-five published cohorts were identified for inclusion, with a total of 4821 patients (2235 with low-risk, 1894 with intermediate-risk, and 446 with high-risk disease, when reported) treated with a variety of dose/fractionation schemes, permitting dose-response modeling. Five studies had a median follow-up of more than 5 years. Dosing regimens ranged from 32 to 50 Gy in 4 to 5 fractions, with total BED (ÃŽÂ±/ÃŽÂ² = 1.5 Gy) between 183.1 and 383.3 Gy. At 5 years, we found that in patients with low-intermediate risk disease, an equivalent doses of 2 Gy per fraction (EQD2) of 71 Gy (31.7 Gy in 5 fractions) achieved a TCP of 90% and an EQD2 of 90 Gy (36.1 Gy in 5 fractions) achieved a TCP of 95%. In patients with high-risk disease, an EQD2 of 97 Gy (37.6 Gy in 5 fractions) can achieve a TCP of 90% and an EQD2 of 102 Gy (38.7 Gy in 5 fractions) can achieve a TCP of 95%. We found significant variation in the published literature on target delineation, margins used, dose/fractionation, and treatment schedule. Despite this variation, TCP was excellent. Most prescription doses range from 35 to 40 Gy, delivered in 4 to 5 fractions. The literature did not provide detailed dose-volume data, and our dosimetric analysis was constrained to prescription doses. There are many areas in need of continued research as SBRT continues to evolve as a treatment modality for prostate cancer, including the durability of local control with longer follow-up across risk groups, the efficacy and safety of SBRT as a boost to intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and the impact of incorporating novel imaging techniques into treatment planning.","Royce, Mavroidis, Wang, Falchook, Sheets, Fuller, Collins, El Naqa, Song, Ding, Nahum, Jackson, Grimm, Yorke, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.08.014","20201023","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16220,""
"Machine learning improves mortality risk prediction after cardiac surgery: Systematic review and meta-analysis","Interest in the usefulness of machine learning (ML) methods for outcomes prediction has continued to increase in recent years. However, the advantage of advanced ML model over traditional logistic regression (LR) remains controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the discrimination accuracy between ML models versus LR in predicting operative mortality following cardiac surgery. The present systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement. Discrimination ability was assessed using the C-statistic. Pooled C-statistics and its 95% credibility interval for ML models and LR were obtained were obtained using a Bayesian framework. Pooled estimates for ML models and LR were compared to inform on difference between the 2 approaches. We identified 459 published citations of which 15 studies met inclusion criteria and were used for the quantitative and qualitative analysis. When the best ML model from individual study was used, meta-analytic estimates showed that ML were associated with a significantly higher C-statistic (ML, 0.88; 95% credibility interval, 0.83-0.93 vs LR, 0.81; 95% credibility interval, 0.77-0.85; PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .03). When individual ML algorithms were instead selected, we found a nonsignificant trend toward better prediction with each of ML algorithms. We found no evidence of publication bias (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .70). The present findings suggest that when compared with LR, ML models provide better discrimination in mortality prediction after cardiac surgery. However, the magnitude and clinical influence of such an improvement remains uncertain.","Benedetto, Dimagli, Sinha, Cocomello, Gibbison, Caputo, Gaunt, Lyon, Holmes, Angelini","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.07.105","20200909","logistic regression; machine learning; meta-analysis; mortality; prediction; risk model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16221,""
"Information Retrieval and Awareness about Evidence-Based Dentistry among Dental Undergraduate Students-A Comparative Study between Students from Malaysia and Finland","A fundamental skill in education includes the ability to search for, evaluate, and synthesize information, and this cannot be underestimated in dental education. The aim of this study was to assess how dental students from Malaysia and Finland acquire scientific information and to compare their information retrieval skills. Fourth and fifth-year dental students from Malaysia and Finland were invited to participate. A self-administered structured questionnaire including items about the use of information sources, subjective assessment of literature retrieval skills and knowledge was used. A total of 226 dental students participated in the survey: 131 from Malaysia and 95 from Finland. In both countries, the highest interest for data retrieval among students was found in the oral surgery specialty. The three most used sources of information among Malaysian students were personal lecture notes, dental textbooks, and colleagues; while Finnish students used colleagues, lecture notes, and current clinical guidelines. Students' knowledge of evidence-based practice was inadequate in both student groups. Though the majority of participants reported that they had good or passable skills in literature retrieval, more students from Finland judged themselves to have at least good skills compared to those from Malaysia. Dental education in both countries includes information retrieval studies and mandatory research projects. However, students did not often use those sources that are considered essential in evidence-based dentistry. Universities should further develop educational and training interventions that guide students to use knowledge resources more effectively for critically appraising scientific evidence.","Nieminen, Uma, Pal, Laitala, Lappalainen, Varghese","https://doi.org/10.3390/dj8030103","20201027","Finland; Malaysia; clinical appraisal; dental students; evidence-based dentistry; literature retrieval","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16222,""
"Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in primary care: narrative review of C reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing (POCT) and antibacterial use in patients who present with symptoms of RTI","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to be a global problem and continues to be addressed through national strategies to improve diagnostics, develop new antimicrobials and promote antimicrobial stewardship. Patients who attend general (ambulatory) practice with symptoms of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are invariably assessed by some sort of clinical decision rule (CDR). However, CDRs rely on a cluster of non-specific clinical observations. A narrative review of the literature was undertaken to ascertain the value of C reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing (POCT) to guide antibacterial prescribing in adult patients presenting to general practitioner (GP) practices with symptoms of RTI. Studies that were included were Cochrane reviews, systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, cluster randomised trials, controlled before and after studies, cohort studies and economic evaluations. An overwhelming number of studies demonstrated that the use of CRP tests in patients presenting with RTI symptoms reduces index antibacterial prescribing. GPs and patients report a good acceptability for a CRP POCT and economic evaluations show cost-effectiveness of CRP POCT over existing RTI management in primary care. POCTs increase diagnostic precision for GPs in the better management of patients with RTI. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, patients will expect greater precision in diagnosing and managing their illnesses. Adopting systems that markedly reduce antibiotic consumption is a no-brainer for governments that are struggling to address the rise in AMR.","Cooke, Llor, Hopstaken, Dryden, Butler","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2020-000624","20201001","bacterial infection; respiratory infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16223,""
"[Study on traditional processing method of Mongolian medicine and excipient usage based on data mining]","This paper explores Mongolian medicine processing methods and the use regularity of excipient by text mining techniques. Relevant books of Mongolian medicine processing were consulted to collect data on Mongolian medicine processing methods and excipient, and select data based on processing methods and excipient noun frequency statistics. Microsoft Excel 2010 software was used for statistical analysis and mining for the usage regularity of different types of Mongolian medicinal materials in different periods. And Cytoscape 3.6.1 software was used for visual presentation. The topological analysis showed the top five processing methods were net production, development, frying, calcining and cooking, and the top five processing excipient were fresh milk, wine, urine, cream and mineral borax. Frequency analysis showed that the plant medicinal materials were mostly recorded in the 18~(th) and 21~(st) centuries, especially in the 21 st century; the processing methods mostly contained water processing, repair processing and other methods. The mineral medicinal materials were mostly recorded in the 18~(th), 19~(th) and 21~(st) centuries; most of the processing methods were the fire processing method. The animal medicinal materials were recorded in the 18~(th), 19~(th) and 21~(st) century; the fire processing method occupied a major position, and the repair processing and the grinding processing were markedly increased in the 21~(st) century. In the use of excipient, liquid excipient were mostly used in plant medicines. Solid excipient were most commonly used in the 18~(th) century. Animal excipient were mostly used during the processing in the 18~(th) century. The use of liquid excipient gradually increased in the 19~(th) and 21~(st) centuries.

"Does veneering technique affect the bond strength of bilayer Y-TZP? A systematic review and meta-analysis","Reasons for failures of bilayer yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (Y-TZP) restorations include the core-veneer interface bond strength. The influence of the veneering method on the bond strength of veneered Y-TZP is unclear. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of the veneering method on the bond strength of bilayer Y-TZP. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Searches were performed on PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science (Core Collection), and Scopus for inÃ‚Â vitro studies evaluating the effect of the veneering technique on the bond strength of bilayer Y-TZP. Statistical analyses were performed with random-effect models (ÃŽÂ±=.05). From 619 identified studies, 140 were selected for full-text analysis and 16 were included. Manual searching yielded no additional articles. The meta-analyses comprised 15 studies, and 1 study was included only in the descriptive analysis. Meta-analyses compared the hand-layered method (control) with pressed, fused, and cemented veneering methods. The fused and cemented techniques were analyzed by using subgroups assessing the veneering ceramic type (predominantly glass-ceramics and particle-filled glass-ceramics). Similar bond strength results (P=.540) were found for pressed and hand-layered veneered Y-TZP specimens. Fused veneers achieved higher bond strength values (P&lt;.001) than the hand-layered veneers on Y-TZP frameworks, irrespective of the veneering ceramic type (predominantly glass-ceramics: P=.002; particle-filled glass-ceramics: P&lt;.001). Global and subgroup analyses indicated that lower core-veneer bond strength values (P&lt;.001) were found for cemented in relation to hand-layered veneers. Core-veneer interfacial adhesion was equivalent for pressed and hand-layered veneering techniques. Improved bond strength, regardless of the veneer ceramic material type, was achieved by the fused veneering method, which seems to be a promising choice for the veneering of Y-TZP. In contrast, the cemented method may be unsuitable for veneering Y-TZP structures because of its lower bond strength than the hand-layered veneering technique.","Marchionatti, AurÃƒÂ©lio, Wandscher","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prosdent.2020.06.008","20200907","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16225,""
"Cost-effectiveness analysis of polycystic ovary syndrome management and the risk of gestational diabetes in pregnant women: a decision-tree model","This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of metformin to reduce the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) from the US health-care payer perspective. A decision tree was developed to simulate the progression of PCOS in a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 pregnant women diagnosed with PCOS and two scenarios were tested. Normal glucose regulation without developing GDM, average cost-effectiveness ratios (ACER), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were the outcome measures assessed through pregnancy. Evidence from randomized clinical trials and other published literature were used to assess disease progression and its associated health-care costs. Sensitivity analyses that varied key model parameters were conducted. Management of PCOS with metformin was associated with lowest ACER ($669.78 per normal glucose regulation without GDM) as compared to 'no intervention' strategy. Metformin use is the most cost-effective strategy to manage PCOS during pregnancy with average cost savings of $7,593,372.97 and an average effect gain of 2271 of normal glucose regulation without GDM among pregnant women with PCOS. Sensitivity analyses determined that the results are robust. Management of PCOS during pregnancy may be a cost-effective strategy to reduce GDM risk and its associated complications.","Alenzi","https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2020.1819796","20200925","GDM; PCOS; cost-effectiveness; decision tree; metformin; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16226,""
"The impact of introducing automated dispensing cabinets, barcode medication administration, and closed-loop electronic medication management systems on work processes and safety of controlled medications in hospitals: A systematic review","Technology in the form of Automated Dispensing Cabinets (ADCs), Barcode Medication Administration (BCMA), and closed-loop Electronic Medication Management Systems (EMMS) are implemented in hospitals to assist with the supply, use and monitoring of medications. Although there is evidence to suggest that these technologies can reduce errors and improve monitoring of medications in general, little is known about their impact on controlled medications such as opioids. This review aimed to fill this knowledge gap by synthesising literature to determine the impact of ADCs, BCMA and closed-loop EMMS on clinical work processes, medication safety, and drug diversion associated with controlled medications in the inpatient setting. Eight databases (Medline, Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and ScienceDirect) were searched for relevant papers published between January 2000 and May 2019. Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods empirical studies published in English that reported findings on the impact of ADCs, BCMA and/or closed-loop EMMS on controlled medications in the inpatient setting were included. In total, 16 papers met the inclusion criteria. Eleven studies reported on ADCs, four on BCMA, and only one on closed-loop EMMS. Only four studies focused on controlled medications, with the remainder reporting only incidental findings. Studies reported the elimination of manual end-of-shift counts of controlled medications after ADC implementation but cases of drug diversion were reported despite introducing ADCs. Three quantitative studies reported reductions in medication errors after implementing BCMA, but medications labelled with wrong barcodes and unreadable barcodes led to confusion and administration errors. More quality, targeted research is needed to provide evidence on the benefits and also risks of implementing technology to safeguard against inappropriate use of controlled medications in the inpatient setting. Processes need to be in place to supplement technological capabilities, and resources should be made available for post-implementation evaluations and interventions.","Zheng, Lichtner, Van Dort, Baysari","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.08.001","20200906","ADCs; BCMA; Closed-loop EMMS; Controlled medications; Drug diversion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16227,""
"Normal appearing brain white matter changes in relapsing multiple sclerosis: Texture image and classification analysis in serial MRI scans","There is a clinical interest in identifying normal appearing white matter (NAWM) areas in brain T2-weighted (T<sub>2</sub>W) MRI scans in multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects. These areas are susceptible to disease development and areas need to be studied in order to find potential associations between texture feature changes and disease progression. The subjects investigated had a first demyelinating event (Clinically Isolated Syndrome-CIS) at baseline (Time<sub>0</sub>), and the NAWM<sub>0</sub> (i.e. NAWM at Time<sub>0</sub>) of the brain tissue was subsequently converted to demyelinating plaques (as evaluated in a follow up MRI at Time<sub>6</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>12</sub>). 38 untreated subjects that had developed a CIS, had brain MRI scans within an interval of 6-12Ã‚Â months (Time<sub>6</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>12</sub> at follow-up). An experienced MS neurologist manually delineated the demyelinating lesions at Time<sub>0</sub> (L<sub>0</sub>) and at Time<sub>6</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>12</sub> (L<sub>6</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>12</sub>). Areas in the Time<sub>6</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>12</sub> MRI scans, where new lesions had been developed, were mapped back to their corresponding NAWM areas on the Time<sub>0</sub> MR scans (ROIS<sub>0</sub>). In addition, contralateral ROIs of similar size and shape were segmented on the same images at Time<sub>0</sub> (ROIS<sub>C0</sub>) to form an intra-subject control group. Following that, texture features were extracted from all prescribed areas and MS lesions. Texture features were used as input into Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to differentiate between the following: NAWM<sub>0</sub> vs ROIS<sub>C0</sub>, NAWM<sub>0</sub> vs NAWM<sub>6</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>12</sub>, NAWM<sub>0</sub> vs L<sub>0</sub>, NAWM<sub>6</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>12</sub> vs L<sub>6</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>12</sub>, ROIS<sub>0</sub> vs L<sub>0</sub>, ROIS<sub>0</sub> vs L<sub>6</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>12</sub> and ROIS<sub>0</sub> vs ROIS<sub>C0</sub>, where the corresponding % correct classifications scores were 89%, 95%, 98%, 92%, 85%, 90% and 65% respectively. Texture features may provide complementary information for following up the development and progression of MS disease. Future work will investigate the proposed method on more subjects.","Loizou, Pantzaris, Pattichis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mri.2020.08.022","20200928","Classification analysis; Contralateral lesion segmentation; MRI imaging; Multiple sclerosis; Texture analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16228,""
"Identification of prognostic and immune-related gene signatures in the tumor microenvironment of endometrial cancer","Uterine corpus endometrial cancer (UCEC) is one of the most prevalent female malignancies in clinical practice. Due to the lack of effective biomarkers and personalized treatments, the prognosis of advanced-stage EC remains unfavorable. Modulation of the immune microenvironment is closely related to the onset and development of endometrial cancer. In the present study, we attempt to systematically analyze the characteristics of the immune microenvironment of endometrial cancer and investigate its association with clinical features by applying bioinformatics. RNA-Seq in TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and clinical follow-up information of patents were used for analysis. The Tumor Microenvironment (TME) score infiltration patterns of 523 endometrial cancer patients were evaluated using CIBERSORT. Random forest, multivariable cox analysis were used to build the TME score. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the genes that show significant differences in the frequency of mutations between groups. Two TME phenotypes were defined. There is a significant relationship between the TME score and grade. High TME score samples are highly expressed in immune activation, TGF pathway activation and immune checkpoint genes, and low TME score samples have high frequency mutations of PTEN, CSE1L and ITGB3. Therefore, describing the comprehensive landscape of UCEC's TME characteristics may help explain patients' response to immunotherapy and provide new strategies for cancer treatment.","Wang, Wang, Sun, Liu, Yang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106931","20200915","Immunotherapy; TCGA; Tumor Microenvironment; UCEC","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16229,""
"Chinese Clinical Named Entity Recognition in Electronic Medical Records: Development of a Lattice Long Short-Term Memory Model With Contextualized Character Representations","Clinical named entity recognition (CNER), whose goal is to automatically identify clinical entities in electronic medical records (EMRs), is an important research direction of clinical text data mining and information extraction. The promotion of CNER can provide support for clinical decision making and medical knowledge base construction, which could then improve overall medical quality. Compared with English CNER, and due to the complexity of Chinese word segmentation and grammar, Chinese CNER was implemented later and is more challenging. With the development of distributed representation and deep learning, a series of models have been applied in Chinese CNER. Different from the English version, Chinese CNER is mainly divided into character-based and word-based methods that cannot make comprehensive use of EMR information and cannot solve the problem of ambiguity in word representation. In this paper, we propose a lattice long short-term memory (LSTM) model combined with a variant contextualized character representation and a conditional random field (CRF) layer for Chinese CNER: the Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo)-lattice-LSTM-CRF model. The lattice LSTM model can effectively utilize the information from characters and words in Chinese EMRs; in addition, the variant ELMo model uses Chinese characters as input instead of the character-encoding layer of the ELMo model, so as to learn domain-specific contextualized character embeddings. We evaluated our method using two Chinese CNER datasets from the China Conference on Knowledge Graph and Semantic Computing (CCKS): the CCKS-2017 CNER dataset and the CCKS-2019 CNER dataset. We obtained F1 scores of 90.13% and 85.02% on the test sets of these two datasets, respectively. Our results show that our proposed method is effective in Chinese CNER. In addition, the results of our experiments show that variant contextualized character representations can significantly improve the performance of the model.","Li, Wang, Hui, Zou, Li, Xu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.2196/19848","20201001","ELMo; clinical named entity recognition; deep learning; lattice LSTM; neural network; sequence tagging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16230,""
"Validation of chief complaints, medical history, medications, and physician diagnoses structured with an integrated emergency department information system in Japan: the Next Stage ER system","Emergency department information systems (EDIS) facilitate free-text data use for clinical research; however, no study has validated whether the Next Stage ER system (NSER), an EDIS used in Japan, accurately translates electronic medical records (EMRs) into structured data. This is a retrospective cohort study using data from the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary care hospital from 2018 to 2019. We used EMRs of 500 random samples from 27,000 ED visits during the study period. Through the NSER system, chief complaints were translated into 231 chief complaint categories based on the Japan Triage and Acuity Scale. Medical history and physician's diagnoses were encoded using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision; medications were encoded as Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System codes. Two reviewers independently reviewed 20 items (e.g., presence of fever) for each study component (e.g., chief complaints). We calculated association measures of the structured data by the NSER system, using the chart review results as the gold standard. Sensitivities were very high (&gt;90%) in 17 chief complaints. Positive predictive values were high for 14 chief complaints (Ã¢â€°Â¥80%). Negative predictive values were Ã¢â€°Â¥96% for all chief complaints.

"Current understanding of the metabolism of micronutrients in chronic alcoholic liver disease","Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remains an important health problem worldwide. Perturbation of micronutrients has been broadly reported to be a common characteristic in patients with ALD, given the fact that micronutrients often act as composition or coenzymes of many biochemical enzymes responsible for the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and cell proliferation. Mapping the metabolic pattern and the function of these micronutrients is a prerequisite before targeted intervention can be delivered in clinical practice. Recent years have registered a significant improvement in our understanding of the role of micronutrients on the pathogenesis and progression of ALD. However, how and to what extent these micronutrients are involved in the pathophysiology of ALD remains largely unknown. In the current study, we provide a review of recent studies that investigated the imbalance of micronutrients in patients with ALD with a focus on zinc, iron, copper, magnesium, selenium, vitamin D and vitamin E, and determine how disturbances in micronutrients relates to the pathophysiology of ALD. Overall, zinc, selenium, vitamin D, and vitamin E uniformly exhibited a deficiency, and iron demonstrated an elevated trend. While for copper, both an elevation and deficiency were observed from existing literature. More importantly, we also highlight several challenges in terms of low sample size, study design discrepancies, sample heterogeneity across studies, and the use of machine learning approaches.","Wu, Meng","https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v26.i31.4567","20200905","Alcoholic liver disease; Malnutrition; Metabolism; Oxidative stress; Trace elements; Vitamins","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16232,""

"Identification of most influential co-occurring gene suites for gastrointestinal cancer using biomedical literature mining and graph-based influence maximization","Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc., are among the most frequent malignancies diagnosed annually and represent a major public health problem worldwide. This paper reports an aided curation pipeline to identify potential influential genes for gastrointestinal cancer. The curation pipeline integrates biomedical literature to identify named entities by Bi-LSTM-CNN-CRF methods. The entities and their associations can be used to construct a graph, and from which we can compute the sets of co-occurring genes that are the most influential based on an influence maximization algorithm. The sets of co-occurring genes that are the most influential that we discover include RARA - CRBP1, CASP3 - BCL2, BCL2 - CASP3 - CRBP1, RARA - CASP3 - CRBP1, FOXJ1 - RASSF3 - ESR1, FOXJ1 - RASSF1A - ESR1, FOXJ1 - RASSF1A - TNFAIP8 - ESR1. With TCGA and functional and pathway enrichment analysis, we prove the proposed approach works well in the context of gastrointestinal cancer.

"On How Chronic Conditions Affect the Patient-AI Interaction: A Literature Review","<i>Background</i>: Across the globe, managing chronic diseases has been recognized as a challenge for patients and healthcare providers. The state of the art in managing chronic conditions requires not only responding to the clinical needs of the patient, but also guaranteeing a comfortable state of wellbeing for them, despite living with the disease. This demands mutual effort between the patient and the physician in constantly collecting data, monitoring, and understanding the disease. The advent of artificial intelligence has made this process easier. However, studies have rarely attempted to analyze how the different artificial intelligence based health coaching systems are used to manage different types of chronic conditions. <i>Objective</i>: Throughout this grounded theory literature review, we aim to provide an overview for the features that characterize artificial intelligence based health coaching systems used by patients with chronic diseases. <i>Methods</i>: During our search and paper selection process process, we use three bibliographic libraries (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library). Using the grounded theory, we extract overarching themes for the artificial intelligence based health coaching systems. These systems are then classified according to their role, platform, type of interaction with the patient, as well as targeted chronic conditions. Of 869 citations retrieved, 31 unique studies are included in this review. <i>Results</i>: The included studies assess 14 different chronic conditions. Common roles for AI-based health coaching systems are: developing adherence, informing, motivating, reminding, preventing, building a care network, and entertaining. Health coaching systems combine the aforementioned roles to cater to the needs of the patients. The combinations of these roles differ between multilateral, unilateral, opposing bilateral, complementing bilateral, one-role-missing, and the blurred role combinations. <i>Conclusion:</i> Clinical solutions and research related to artificial intelligence based health coaching systems are very limited. Clear guidelines to help develop artificial intelligence-based health coaching systems are still blurred.

"Applications of neural networks in urology: a systematic review","Over the last decade, major advancements in artificial intelligence technology have emerged and revolutionized the extent to which physicians are able to personalize treatment modalities and care for their patients. Artificial intelligence technology aimed at mimicking/simulating human mental processes, such as deep learning artificial neural networks (ANNs), are composed of a collection of individual units known as 'artificial neurons'. These 'neurons', when arranged and interconnected in complex architectural layers, are capable of analyzing the most complex patterns. The aim of this systematic review is to give a comprehensive summary of the contemporary applications of deep learning ANNs in urological medicine. Fifty-five articles were included in this systematic review and each article was assigned an 'intermediate' score based on its overall quality. Of these 55 articles, nine studies were prospective, but no nonrandomized control trials were identified. In urological medicine, the application of novel artificial intelligence technologies, particularly ANNs, have been considered to be a promising step in improving physicians' diagnostic capabilities, especially with regards to predicting the aggressiveness and recurrence of various disorders. For benign urological disorders, for example, the use of highly predictive and reliable algorithms could be helpful for the improving diagnoses of male infertility, urinary tract infections, and pediatric malformations. In addition, articles with anecdotal experiences shed light on the potential of artificial intelligence-assisted surgeries, such as with the aid of virtual reality or augmented reality.","Checcucci, De Cillis, Granato, Chang, Afyouni, Okhunov","https://doi.org/10.1097/MOU.0000000000000814","20201005","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16236,""
"ISAC Probe Tag Dictionary: Standardized Nomenclature for Detection and Visualization Labels Used in Cytometry and Microscopy Imaging","Since the advent of microscopy imaging and flow cytometry, there has been an explosion in the number of probes, consisting of a component binding to an analyte and a detectable tag, to mark areas of interest in or on cells and tissue. Probe tags have been created to detect and/or visualize probes. Over time, these probe tags have increased in number. The expansion has resulted in arbitrarily created synonyms of probe tags used in publications and software. The synonyms are problematic for readability of publications, accuracy of text/data mining, and bridging data from multiple platforms, protocols, and databases for Big Data analysis. Development and implementation of a universal language for probe tags will ensure equivalent quality and level of data being reported or extracted for clinical/scientific evaluation as well as help connect data from many platforms. The International Society for Advancement of Cytometry Data Standards Task Force composed of academic scientists and industry hardware/software/reagent manufactures have developed recommendations for a standardized nomenclature for probe tags used in cytometry and microscopy imaging. These recommendations are shared in this technical note in the form of a Probe Tag Dictionary.

"A systematic review of radiomics in osteosarcoma: utilizing radiomics quality score as a tool promoting clinical translation","To assess the methodological quality and risk of bias in radiomics studies investigating diagnosis, therapy response, and survival of patients with osteosarcoma. In this systematic review, literatures on radiomics in osteosarcoma were included and assessed for methodological quality through the radiomics quality score (RQS). The risk of bias and concern of application was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. A meta-analysis of studies focusing on predicting osteosarcoma response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed. Twelve radiomics studies exploring osteosarcoma were identified, and five were included in meta-analysis. The RQS reached an average of 20.4% (6.92 of 36) with good inter-rater agreement (ICC 0.95, 95% CI 0.85-0.99). Four studies validated results with an internal dataset, none of which used external dataset; one study was prospectively designed, and another one shared part of the dataset. The risk of bias and concern of application were mainly related to index test aspect. The meta-analysis showed a diagnostic odds ratio of 43.68 (95%CI 13.5-141.31) for predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with high heterogeneity and low methodological quality. The overall scientific quality of included studies is insufficient; however, radiomics remains a promising technology for predicting treatment response, which might guide therapeutic decision-making and related to prognosis. Improvements in study design, validation, and open science needs to be made to demonstrate the generalizability of findings and to achieve clinical applications. Widespread application of RQS, pre-trained RQS scoring procedure, and modification of RQS in response to clinical needs are necessary. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Limited radiomics studies were established in osteosarcoma with mean RQS of 20.4%, commonly due to unvalidated results, retrospective study design, and absence of open science. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Meta-analysis of radiomics studies predicting osteosarcoma response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed high diagnostic odds ratio 43.68, while high heterogeneity and low methodological quality were the main concerns. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ A previously trained data extraction instrument allowed reaching moderate inter-rater agreement in RQS applications, while RQS still needs improvement to become a wide adaptive tool in reviews of radiomics studies, in routine self-check before manuscript submitting and in study design.","Zhong, Hu, Si, Jia, Xing, Zhang, Yao","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07221-w","20200902","Machine learning; Neoadjuvant therapy; Osteosarcoma; Quality improvement; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16238,""
"Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in Spine Surgery","Narrative review. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as disruptive technologies with the potential to drastically affect clinical decision making in spine surgery. AI can enhance the delivery of spine care in several arenas: (1) preoperative patient workup, patient selection, and outcome prediction; (2) quality and reproducibility of spine research; (3) perioperative surgical assistance and data tracking optimization; and (4) intraoperative surgical performance. The purpose of this narrative review is to concisely assemble, analyze, and discuss current trends and applications of AI and ML in conventional and robotic-assisted spine surgery. We conducted a comprehensive PubMed search of peer-reviewed articles that were published between 2006 and 2019 examining AI, ML, and robotics in spine surgery. Key findings were then compiled and summarized in this review. The majority of the published AI literature in spine surgery has focused on predictive analytics and supervised image recognition for radiographic diagnosis. Several investigators have studied the use of AI/ML in the perioperative setting in small patient cohorts; pivotal trials are still pending. Artificial intelligence has tremendous potential in revolutionizing comprehensive spine care. Evidence-based, predictive analytics can help surgeons improve preoperative patient selection, surgical indications, and individualized postoperative care. Robotic-assisted surgery, while still in early stages of development, has the potential to reduce surgeon fatigue and improve technical precision.","Rasouli, Shao, Neifert, Gibbs, Habboub, Steinmetz, Benzel, Mroz","https://doi.org/10.1177/2192568220915718","20200928","artificial intelligence; machine learning; radiology; review; robotic spine surgery; spine surgery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16239,""
"Artificial intelligence in cyber physical systems","This article conducts a literature review of current and future challenges in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in cyber physical systems. The literature review is focused on identifying a conceptual framework for increasing resilience with AI through automation supporting both, a technical and human level. The methodology applied resembled a literature review and taxonomic analysis of complex internet of things (IoT) interconnected and coupled cyber physical systems. There is an increased attention on propositions on models, infrastructures and frameworks of IoT in both academic and technical papers. These reports and publications frequently represent a juxtaposition of other related systems and technologies (e.g. Industrial Internet of Things, Cyber Physical Systems, Industry 4.0 etc.). We review academic and industry papers published between 2010 and 2020. The results determine a new hierarchical cascading conceptual framework for analysing the evolution of AI decision-making in cyber physical systems. We argue that such evolution is <i>inevitable and autonomous</i> because of the increased integration of connected devices (IoT) in cyber physical systems. To support this argument, taxonomic methodology is adapted and applied for transparency and justifications of concepts selection decisions through building summary maps that are applied for designing the hierarchical cascading conceptual framework.","Radanliev, De Roure, Van Kleek, Santos, Ani","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-020-01049-0","20200928","Anomaly detection; Artificial cognition; Artificial intelligence; Cyber physical systems; Industrial internet of things; Industry 4.0","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16240,""
"Proteomics and Metabolomics Approaches towards a Functional Insight onto AUTISM Spectrum Disorders: Phenotype Stratification and Biomarker Discovery","Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by behavioral alterations and currently affect about 1% of children. Significant genetic factors and mechanisms underline the causation of ASD. Indeed, many affected individuals are diagnosed with chromosomal abnormalities, submicroscopic deletions or duplications, single-gene disorders or variants. However, a range of metabolic abnormalities has been highlighted in many patients, by identifying biofluid metabolome and proteome profiles potentially usable as ASD biomarkers. Indeed, next-generation sequencing and other omics platforms, including proteomics and metabolomics, have uncovered early age disease biomarkers which may lead to novel diagnostic tools and treatment targets that may vary from patient to patient depending on the specific genomic and other omics findings. The progressive identification of new proteins and metabolites acting as biomarker candidates, combined with patient genetic and clinical data and environmental factors, including microbiota, would bring us towards advanced clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) assisted by machine learning models for advanced ASD-personalized medicine. Herein, we will discuss novel computational solutions to evaluate new proteome and metabolome ASD biomarker candidates, in terms of their recurrence in the reviewed literature and laboratory medicine feasibility. Moreover, the way to exploit CDSS, performed by artificial intelligence, is presented as an effective tool to integrate omics data to electronic health/medical records (EHR/EMR), hopefully acting as added value in the near future for the clinical management of ASD.","Ristori, Mortera, Marzano, Guerrera, Vernocchi, Ianiro, Gardini, Torre, Valeri, Vicari, Gasbarrini, Putignani","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176274","20201001","autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); clinical decision support systems (CDSSs); disease biomarkers; interactomics; metabolomics; proteomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16241,""
"Literature-Wide Association Studies (LWAS) for a Rare Disease: Drug Repurposing for Inflammatory Breast Cancer","Drug repurposing is an effective means for rapid drug discovery. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a computational methodology based on Literature-Wide Association Studies (LWAS) of PubMed to repurpose existing drugs for a rare inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). We have developed a methodology that conducted LWAS based on the text mining technology Word2Vec. 3.80 million &quot;cancer&quot;-related PubMed abstracts were processed as the corpus for Word2Vec to derive vector representation of biological concepts. These vectors for drugs and diseases served as the foundation for creating similarity maps of drugs and diseases, respectively, which were then employed to find potential therapy for IBC. Three hundred and thirty-six (336) known drugs and three hundred and seventy (370) diseases were expressed as vectors in this study. Nine hundred and seventy (970) previously known drug-disease association pairs among these drugs and diseases were used as the reference set. Based on the hypothesis that similar drugs can be used against similar diseases, we have identified 18 diseases similar to IBC, with 24 corresponding known drugs proposed to be the repurposing therapy for IBC. The literature search confirmed most known drugs tested for IBC, with four of them being novel candidates. We conclude that LWAS based on the Word2Vec technology is a novel approach to drug repurposing especially useful for rare diseases.","Ji, Jin, Dong, Dixon, Williams, Zheng","https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25173933","20201001","IBC; Word2Vec; drug repurposing; inflammatory breast cancer; rare diseases; text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16242,""
"Economic evaluations of non-pharmacological interventions and cost-of-illness studies in bipolar disorder: A systematic review","Background Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with substantial societal burden. Therefore, economic studies in BD are becoming increasingly important. The goal of the current study is three-fold: (1) summarize the evidence regarding economic evaluations (EEs) of non-pharmacological interventions for BD, (2) summarize cost-of-illness studies (COIs) for BD published 2012 or later and (3) assess the quality of the identified studies. Methods A systematic search was conducted in MedLine, EMBASE and PsycINFO. For both EEs and COIs, quality assessments were conducted and general and methodological characteristics of the studies were extracted. Outcomes included incremental-cost-effectiveness ratios for EEs and direct and indirect costs for COIs. Results Eight EEs and ten COIs were identified. The included studies revealed high heterogeneity in general and methodological characteristics and study quality. All interventions resulted in improved clinical outcomes. Five studies additionally concluded decreased total costs. For COIs, we found a wide range of direct ($881-$27,617) and indirect cost estimates per capita per year ($1,568-$116,062). Limitations High heterogeneity in terms of interventions, study design and outcomes made it difficult to compare results across studies. Conclusions Interventions improved clinical outcomes in all studies and led to cost-savings in five studies. Findings suggest that non-pharmacological intervention for BD might be cost-effective. Studies on the costs of BD revealed that BD has a substantial economic burden. However, we also found that the number of EEs was relatively low and methodology was heterogenous and therefore encourage future research to widen the body of knowledge in this research field and use standardized methodology.","Kraiss, Wijnen, Kupka, Bohlmeijer, Lokkerbol","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.064","20200902","Bipolar disorder; Cost-benefit; Cost-effectiveness; Cost-of-illness; Economic evaluation; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16243,""
"A Review of Obesity, Physical Activity, and Cardiovascular Disease","The focus of this review is to discuss obesity, physical activity (and physical inactivity/sedentary behavior), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and their often interrelated health implications. The authors summarize the pathophysiological changes associated with obesity, which lead to the development of CVD, recommendations for interventions such as diet, increased physical activity, and weight loss according to current literature and guidelines, and the critical importance of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Clinical trials continue to demonstrate improved outcomes among overweight or obese individuals who achieve a healthy weight using various methods. Increasing CRF levels appears to demonstrate the largest health improvements, regardless of underlying comorbidities or achieving weight loss. CRF, which is perhaps the single most important predictor of overall health, seems more important than weight loss alone regarding improved CVD outcomes in the obese population. These findings are reproduced in studies involving patients with various forms of CVD and CVD risk factors. The importance of CRF is well established; future endeavors to establish specific CRF targets for various patient cohorts are needed.","Elagizi, Kachur, Carbone, Lavie, Blair","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-020-00403-z","20200901","Atrial fibrillation; Cardiorespiratory fitness; Cardiovascular disease; Coronary artery disease; Heart failure; Obesity; Physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16244,""
"Using a digital patient powered research network to identify outcomes of importance to patients with multiple myeloma","Social media platforms give patients a voice by allowing them to discuss their health and connect with others. These unfiltered and genuine reports offer direct access to what matters most to patients. Exploring the patient-reported outcomes discussed in these platforms reveal clinical insights and behavioral patterns of the real-world patient journey. This research study reviewed health-related quality of life (HRQoL) concepts reported by patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Data were obtained using the Belong.life patient-powered research network (PPRN) using social media listening methods. The analysis cohort consisted of adults diagnosed with MM who signed into the Belong.life platform by June 2018. Natural language processing and medical neural networks were utilized to extract text data to mine and scan for concepts using programmed algorithms. The textual review of the data was conducted on two levels: the over-arching concept of interest (broad symptom and impact classification) and the more specific symptom and impacts report. Concepts were analyzed descriptively and summarized by age, gender, context of report, and stage of disease/treatment journey. Two hundred thirty patients with MM from the United States (52%), Israel (42%), Canada (3%), and 3% from Egypt, France, Greece, India, United Kingdom, and Australia were identified. A total of 57% were female and at account registration the median age was 57Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. A total of 126 patients had evaluable text data to search concepts being discussed. The PPRN platform identified 93% of the concepts from the conceptual model developed based on prior literature review. The most commonly reported symptoms were neuropathy, tiredness, nausea, back pain, fatigue, and bone pain. Back pain appeared as the most prominent symptom early in the disease and sometimes occurred prior to MM diagnosis. Tiredness, nausea, fatigue, and bone pain were frequently reported after MM diagnosis, with the start of treatment. Patient-oriented social media platforms, such as Belong.life, can capture and contribute to a holistic vision of concepts surrounding patients' HRQoL. The ability to understand when a certain debilitating symptom appeared and to which sub-population of patients may allow for a personalized approach to treatment, improving adherence and quality of care as well as increasing patient well-being.","Gries, Fastenau","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41687-020-00242-5","20200928","Oncology; Patient outcomes; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16245,""
"Association of Cardiorespiratory Fitness Levels During Youth With Health Risk Later in Life: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Although the associations between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and health in adults are well understood, to date, no systematic review has quantitatively examined the association between CRF during youth and health parameters later in life. To examine the prospective association between CRF in childhood and adolescence and future health status and to assess whether changes in CRF are associated with future health status at least 1 year later. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, and SPORTDiscus electronic databases were searched for relevant articles published from database inception to January 30, 2020. The following inclusion criteria were used: CRF measured using a validated test and assessed at baseline and/or its change from baseline to the end of follow-up, healthy population with a mean age of 3 to 18 years at baseline, and prospective cohort design with a follow-up period of at least 1 year. Data were processed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled effect size. Anthropometric and adiposity measurements and cardiometabolic health parameters. Fifty-five studies were included with a total of 37Ã¢â‚¬Â¯563 youths (46% female).

"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) detection in Chest X-Ray images using majority voting based classifier ensemble","Novel coronavirus disease (nCOVID-19) is the most challenging problem for the world. The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2), leading to high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The study reveals that infected patients exhibit distinct radiographic visual characteristics along with fever, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, etc. Chest X-Ray (CXR) is one of the important, non-invasive clinical adjuncts that play an essential role in the detection of such visual responses associated with SARS-COV-2 infection. However, the limited availability of expert radiologists to interpret the CXR images and subtle appearance of disease radiographic responses remains the biggest bottlenecks in manual diagnosis. In this study, we present an automatic COVID screening (ACoS) system that uses radiomic texture descriptors extracted from CXR images to identify the normal, suspected, and nCOVID-19 infected patients. The proposed system uses two-phase classification approach (normal vs. abnormal and nCOVID-19 vs. pneumonia) using majority vote based classifier ensemble of five benchmark supervised classification algorithms. The training-testing and validation of the ACoS system are performed using 2088 (696 normal, 696 pneumonia and 696 nCOVID-19) and 258 (86 images of each category) CXR images, respectively. The obtained validation results for phase-I (accuracy (ACC)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 98.062%, area under curve (AUC)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.956) and phase-II (ACCÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 91.329% and AUCÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.831) show the promising performance of the proposed system. Further, the Friedman post-hoc multiple comparisons and z-test statistics reveals that the results of ACoS system are statistically significant.

"Machine learning techniques for detecting electrode misplacement and interchanges when recording ECGs: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Electrode misplacement and interchange errors are known problems when recording the 12Ã¢â‚¬â€˜lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Automatic detection of these errors could play an important role for improving clinical decision making and outcomes in cardiac care. The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to 1) study the impact of electrode misplacement on ECG signals and ECG interpretation, 2) to determine the most challenging electrode misplacements to detect using machine learning (ML), 3) to analyse the ML performance of algorithms that detect electrode misplacement or interchange according to sensitivity and specificity and 4) to identify the most commonly used ML technique for detecting electrode misplacement/interchange. This review analysed the current literature regarding electrode misplacement/interchange recognition accuracy using machine learning techniques. A search of three online databases including IEEE, PubMed and ScienceDirect identified 228 articles, while 3 articles were included from additional sources from co-authors. According to the eligibility criteria, 14 articles were selected. The selected articles were considered for qualitative analysis and meta-analysis. The articles showed the effect of lead interchange on ECG morphology and as a consequence on patient diagnoses.

"Periodontitis, Edentulism, and Risk of Mortality: A Systematic Review with Meta-analyses","Periodontitis has been independently associated with the chronic noncommunicable diseases that most frequently lead to death worldwide. The aim of the present systematic review was to study whether people with periodontitis/edentulism are at increased risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality as compared with those without periodontitis/edentulism. Cohort studies were included that 1) evaluated periodontitis or edentulism as exposures in relation to all-cause or cause-specific mortality as an outcome and 2) reported effect estimates as hazard ratios, risk ratios, or odds ratios with 95% CIs or crude numbers. Two review authors independently searched for eligible studies, screened the titles and abstracts, did full-text analysis, extracted the data from the published reports, and performed the risk-of-bias assessment. In case of disagreement, a third review author was consulted. Study results were summarized through random effects meta-analyses. A total of 57 studies were included, involving 48 cohorts and 5.71Ã¢â‚¬â€°million participants. Periodontitis was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.15 to 1.85]) and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (1.47 [1.14 to 1.90]), cancer (1.38 [1.24 to 1.53]), coronary heart disease (2.58 [2.20 to 3.03]), cerebrovascular diseases (3.11 [2.42 to 3.98]), but not pneumonia (0.98 [0.69 to 1.38]). Edentulism (all types) was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (1.66 [1.46 to 1.88]) and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (2.03 [1.50 to 2.74]), cancer (1.55 [1.24 to 1.94]), pneumonia (1.72 [1.07 to 2.78]), coronary heart disease (2.98 [2.43 to 3.65]), and cerebrovascular diseases (3.18 [2.24 to 4.51]).

"Development of Professional Care Program for Nurses in Dementia Wards and Its Educational Effects","To develop an education program for nurses specializing in dementia care, and to investigate its effects. An intervention study of nurses was conducted using a quasi-experiment with 3 randomly assigned groups. Participants were 51 nurses from a psychiatric hospital dementia ward, divided into an intervention program group (17 nurses), a knowledge-acquisition-only group (16 nurses), and a usual-care group (18 nurses) as controls. The program group intervention comprised 3 frameworks: motivation for achieving the task, acquisition of professional knowledge required for dementia care, and sharing of successful experiences based on professional knowledge. The knowledge-acquisition-only group received only the acquisition of professional knowledge framework, and the usual-care group received only the usual-care framework. The intervention period was 3 months. Post-intervention, the program group had a significantly greater sense of self-efficacy associated with professional knowledge and significantly greater self-efficacy associated with practice compared with the knowledge-acquisition-only and the usual-care groups. Professional knowledge was acquired by 80% of the program group, compared with 70% of the knowledge-acquisition-only group. A co-occurrence network diagram of the multivariate analysis results produced by text mining of the descriptive data indicated that nurses provided care for symptoms specific to different diseases based on their pathological mechanisms. Program implementation led to the acquisition of deeper knowledge and greater self-efficacy by sharing expertise-based practices and successful experiences, compared with desk-based learning in a single workshop lecture, suggesting the program's usefulness in clinical practice.","Takeuchi, Kato, Kitamura, Toda, Taniguchi, Shogenji, Tsujiguchi","https://doi.org/10.1177/1533317520950925","20201020","dementia care; nursing education; professional knowledge; self-efficacy; text mining; two-way ANOVA","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16251,""
"Determining grasp selection from arm trajectories via deep learning to enable functional hand movement in tetraplegia","Cervical spinal cord injury severely affects grasping ability of its survivors. Fortunately, many individuals with tetraplegia retain residual arm movements that allow them to reach for objects. We propose a wearable technology that utilizes arm movement trajectory information and deep learning methods to determine grasp selection. Furthermore, we combined this approach with neuromuscular stimulation to determine if self-driven functional hand movement could be enabled in spinal cord injury participants. Two cervical SCI participants performed arbitrary and natural reaching movements toward target objects in three-dimensional space, which were recorded using an inertial sensor worn on their wrist. Time series classifiers were trained to recognize the trajectories using either a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm or a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network<b>.</b> As an initial proof-of-concept, we demonstrate real-time classification of the arbitrary movements using DTW only (due to its implementation simplicity), which when used in combination with a high density neuromuscular stimulation sleeve with textile electrodes, enabled participants to perform functional grasping. Participants were able to consistently perform arbitrary two-dimensional and three-dimensional arm movements which could be classified with high accuracy. Furthermore, it was found that natural reaching trajectories for two different target objects (requiring two different grasp types) were distinct and also discriminable with high accuracy. In offline comparisons, LSTM (mean accuracies 99%) performed significantly better than DTW (mean accuracies 86 and 83%) for both arbitrary and natural reaching movements, respectively. Type I and II errors occurred more frequently for DTW (up to 60 and 15%, respectively), whereas it stayed under 5% for LSTM. Also, DTW achieved online accuracy of 79%. We demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing arm trajectory information to determine grasp selection using a wearable inertial sensor along with DTW and deep learning methods. Importantly, this technology can be successfully used to control neuromuscular stimulation and restore functional independence to individuals living with paralysis. NCT, NCT03385005.

"A scoping review of machine learning in psychotherapy research","Machine learning (ML) offers robust statistical and probabilistic techniques that can help to make sense of large amounts of data. This scoping review paper aims to broadly explore the nature of research activity using ML in the context of psychological talk therapies, highlighting the scope of current methods and considerations for clinical practice and directions for future research. Using a systematic search methodology, fifty-one studies were identified. A narrative synthesis indicates two types of studies, those who developed and tested an ML model (<i>k</i>=44), and those who reported on the feasibility of a particular treatment tool that uses an ML algorithm (<i>k</i>=7). Most model development studies used supervised learning techniques to classify or predict labeled treatment process or outcome data, whereas others used unsupervised techniques to identify clusters in the unlabeled patient or treatment data. Overall, the current applications of ML in psychotherapy research demonstrated a range of possible benefits for indications of treatment process, adherence, therapist skills and treatment response prediction, as well as ways to accelerate research through automated behavioral or linguistic process coding. Given the novelty and potential of this research field, these proof-of-concept studies are encouraging, however, do not necessarily translate to improved clinical practice (yet).","Aafjes-van Doorn, Kamsteeg, Bate, Aafjes","https://doi.org/10.1080/10503307.2020.1808729","20200831","artificial intelligence; big data; machine learning; psychotherapy; scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16253,""
"Deep Learning in Radiation Oncology Treatment Planning for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review","Radiation oncology for prostate cancer is important as it can decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Planning for this modality of treatment is both fundamental, time-consuming and prone to human-errors, leading to potentially avoidable delays in start of treatment. A fundamental step in radiotherapy planning is contouring of radiation targets, where medical specialists contouring, i.e., segment, the boundaries of the structures to be irradiated. Automating this step can potentially lead to faster treatment planning without a decrease in quality, while increasing time available to physicians and also more consistent treatment results. This can be framed as an image segmentation task, which has been studied for many decades in the fields of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. With the advent of Deep Learning, there have been many proposals for different network architectures achieving high performance levels. In this review, we searched the literature for those methods and describe them briefly, grouping those based on Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This is a booming field, evidenced by the date of the publications found. However, most publications use data from a very limited number of patients, which presents an obstacle to deep learning models training. Although the performance of the models has achieved very satisfactory results, there is still room for improvement, and there is arguably a long way before these models can be used safely and effectively in clinical practice.","Almeida, Tavares","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-020-01641-3","20200830","Computer vision; Machine learning; Medical imaging; Radiotherapy; Segmentation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16254,""
"Myocardial Infarction Associates With a Distinct Pericoronary Adipose Tissue Radiomic Phenotype: A Prospective Case-Control Study","This study sought to determine whether coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)-based radiomic analysis of pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) could distinguish patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) from patients with stable or no coronary artery disease (CAD). Imaging of PCAT with CCTA enables detection of coronary inflammation. Radiomics involves extracting quantitative features from medical images to create big data and identify novel imaging biomarkers. In a prospective case-control study, 60 patients with acute MI underwent CCTA within 48Ã‚Â h of admission, before invasive angiography. These subjects were matched to patients with stable CAD (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 60) and controls with no CAD (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 60) by age, sex, risk factors, medications, and CT tube voltage. PCAT was segmented around the proximal right coronary artery (RCA) in all patients and around culprit and nonculprit lesions in patients with MI. PCAT segmentations were analyzed using Radiomics Image Analysis software. Of 1,103 calculated radiomic parameters, 20.3% differed significantly between MI patients and controls, and 16.5% differed between patients with MI and stable CAD (critical pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.0006); whereas none differed between patients with stable CAD and controls. On cluster analysis, the most significant radiomic parameters were texture or geometry based. At 6Ã‚Â months post-MI, there was no significant change in the PCAT radiomic profile around the proximal RCA or nonculprit lesions. Using machine learning (XGBoost), a model integrating clinical features (risk factors, serum lipids, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), PCAT attenuation, and radiomic parameters provided superior discrimination of acute MI (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.87) compared with a model with clinical features and PCAT attenuation (AUC: 0.77; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001) or clinical features alone (AUC: 0.76; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Patients with acute MI have a distinct PCAT radiomic phenotype compared with patients with stable or no CAD. Using machine learning, a radiomics-based model outperforms a PCAT attenuation-based model in accurately identifying patients with MI.","Lin, KolossvÃƒÂ¡ry, Yuvaraj, Cadet, McElhinney, Jiang, Nerlekar, Nicholls, Slomka, Maurovich-Horvat, Wong, Dey","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmg.2020.06.033","20200830","coronary computed tomography angiography; machine learning; myocardial infarction; pericoronary adipose tissue; radiomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16255,""
"Universal Shelter-in-Place Versus Advanced Automated Contact Tracing and Targeted Isolation: A Case for 21st-Century Technologies for SARS-CoV-2 and Future Pandemics","To model and compare effect of digital contact tracing versus shelter-in-place on severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread. Using a classical epidemiologic framework and parameters estimated from literature published between February 1, 2020, and May 25, 2020, we modeled two non-pharmacologic interventions - shelter-in-place and digital contact tracing - to curb spread of SARS-CoV-2. For contact tracing, we assumed an advanced automated contact tracing (AACT) application that sends alerts to individuals advising self-isolation based on individual exposure profile. Model parameters included percentage population ordered to shelter-in-place, adoption rate of AACT, and percentage individuals who appropriately follow recommendations. Under influence of these variables, the number of individuals infected, exposed, and isolated were estimated. Without any intervention, a high rate of infection (&gt;10 million) with early peak is predicted. Shelter-in-place results in rapid decline in infection rate at the expense of impacting a large population segment. The AACT model achieves reduction in infected and exposed individuals similar to shelter-in-place without impacting a large number of individuals. For example, a 50% AACT adoption rate mimics a shelter-in-place order for 40% of the population and results in a greater than 90% decrease in peak number of infections. However, as compared to shelter-in-place, with AACT significantly fewer individuals would be isolated. Wide adoption of digital contact tracing can mitigate infection spread similar to universal shelter-in-place, but with considerably fewer individuals isolated.","Nuzzo, Tan, Raskar, DeSimone, Kapa, Gupta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.06.027","20200903","Automation; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Disease Control; Contact Tracing; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Isolation; Software","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16256,""
"Use of radiomics in the radiation oncology setting: Where do we stand and what do we need?","Radiomics is a field that has been growing rapidly for the past ten years in medical imaging and more particularly in oncology where the primary objective is to contribute to personalised and predictive medicine. This short review aimed at providing some insights regarding the potential value of radiomics for cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. Radiomics may contribute to each stage of the patients' management: diagnosis, planning, treatment monitoring and post-treatment follow-up (toxicity and response). However, its applicability in clinical routine is currently hindered by several factors, including lack of automation, standardisation and harmonisation. A major effort must be carried out to automate the workflow, standardise radiomics good practices and carry out large-scale studies before any transfer to daily clinical practice.","Schick, Lucia, Bourbonne, Dissaux, Pradier, Jaouen, Tixier, Visvikis, Hatt","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canrad.2020.07.005","20201008","Radiomics; Radiomique; Radiotherapy; RadiothÃƒÂ©rapie; Texture; Humans; Neoplasms; Radiation Oncology; Radiotherapy; Radiotherapy, Computer-Assisted","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16257,""
"PASCAL: a pseudo cascade learning framework for breast cancer treatment entity normalization in Chinese clinical text","Knowledge discovery from breast cancer treatment records has promoted downstream clinical studies such as careflow mining and therapy analysis. However, the clinical treatment text from electronic health data might be recorded by different doctors under their hospital guidelines, making the final data rich in author- and domain-specific idiosyncrasies. Therefore, breast cancer treatment entity normalization becomes an essential task for the above downstream clinical studies. The latest studies have demonstrated the superiority of deep learning methods in named entity normalization tasks. Fundamentally, most existing approaches adopt pipeline implementations that treat it as an independent process after named entity recognition, which can propagate errors to later tasks. In addition, despite its importance in clinical and translational research, few studies directly deal with the normalization task in Chinese clinical text due to the complexity of composition forms. To address these issues, we propose PASCAL, an end-to-end and accurate framework for breast cancer treatment entity normalization (TEN). PASCAL leverages a gated convolutional neural network to obtain a representation vector that can capture contextual features and long-term dependencies. Additionally, it treats treatment entity recognition (TER) as an auxiliary task that can provide meaningful information to the primary TEN task and as a particular regularization to further optimize the shared parameters. Finally, by concatenating the context-aware vector and probabilistic distribution vector from TEN, we utilize the conditional random field layer (CRF) to model the normalization sequence and predict the TEN sequential results. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we employ the three latest sequential models as baselines and build the model in single- and multitask on a real-world database. Experimental results show that our method achieves better accuracy and efficiency than state-of-the-art approaches. The effectiveness and efficiency of the presented pseudo cascade learning framework were validated for breast cancer treatment normalization in clinical text. We believe the predominant performance lies in its ability to extract valuable information from unstructured text data, which will significantly contribute to downstream tasks, such as treatment recommendations, breast cancer staging and careflow mining.","An, Wang, Zhang, Zhao, Gao, Huang, Du, Jiao, Yan, Wei, Jin","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-01216-9","20200901","Breast cancer; Cascade learning; Chinese clinical text mining; Treatment entity normalization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16258,""
"Citizen-Patient Involvement in the Development of mHealth Technology: Protocol for a Systematic Scoping Review","The development of mobile technology for information retrieval and communication, both at individual and health organizational levels, has been extensive over the last decade.

The overall aim of this scoping review is to explore the role of citizen-patient involvement in the development of mHealth technology in order to inform future interventions. By identifying key characteristics of citizen-patient involvement in system development, we aim to improve digital communication and collaboration between health care providers and citizen-patients, including sharing of health care data. The systematic scoping review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews by searching literature in 3 steps. We will include literature reporting on the public, citizens, and patients participating in the development of mobile technology for health care purposes in MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, EMBASE, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. A preliminary search was completed in MEDLINE and Scopus. The screening process will be conducted by 2 of the authors. Data will be extracted using a data extraction tool prepared for the study. The study is expected to identify research gaps that will inform and motivate the development of mHealth technology. The final report is planned for submission to an indexed journal in November 2020.

"Atopic phenotypes and their implication in the atopic march","Eczema, allergic rhinitis, and asthma are traditionally considered atopic (or allergic) diseases. They are complex, multifactorial, and are caused by a variety of different mechanisms, which result in multiple heterogeneous clinical phenotypes. Atopic march is usually interpreted as the sequential development of symptoms from eczema in infancy, to asthma, and then allergic rhinitis. <b>Areas covered</b>: The authors reviewed the evidence on the multimorbidity of eczema, asthma, and rhinitis, and the implication of results of data-driven analyses on the concept framework of atopic march. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles published until July 2020. Application of Bayesian machine learning framework to rich phenotypic data from birth cohorts demonstrated that the postulated linear progression of symptoms (atopic march) does not capture the heterogeneity of allergic phenotypes. <b>Expert opinion</b>: Eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis co-exist more often than would be expected by chance, but their relationship can be best understood in a multimorbidity framework, rather than through atopic march sequence. The observation of their co-occurrence does not imply any specific relationship between them, and certainly not a progressive or causal one. It is unlikely that a sngle mechanism such as allergic sensitization underpins different multimorbidity manifestations.","Custovic, Custovic, KljaiÃ„â€¡ BukviÃ„â€¡, Fontanella, Haider","https://doi.org/10.1080/1744666X.2020.1816825","20200916","allergic rhinitis; allergic sensitization; asthma; atopic march; eczema; machine learning; personalized medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16260,""

"Relation Extraction from Biomedical and Clinical Text: Unified Multitask Learning Framework","To minimize the accelerating amount of time invested on the biomedical literature search, numerous approaches for automated knowledge extraction have been proposed. Relation extraction is one such task where semantic relations between the entities are identified from the free text. In the biomedical domain, extraction of regulatory pathways, metabolic processes, adverse drug reaction or disease models necessitates knowledge from the individual relations, for example, physical or regulatory interactions between proteins, drugs, disease or phenotype. We study the relation extraction from three major biomedical and clinical tasks, namely drug-drug interactions, protein-protein interaction, and medical concept relation extraction. Towards this, we model the relation extraction problem in a multi-task learning (MTL) framework, and introduce for the first time the concept of structured self-attentive network complemented with the adversarial learning approach in the prediction of relationships from the biomedical and clinical text. Additionally, we also generate the highly efficient single task model which exploits the shortest dependency path embedding learned over the attentive gated recurrent unit to compare our proposed MTL models. The framework we propose significantly improves over all the baselines (deep learning techniques) and single-task models for predicting the relationships, without compromising on the performance of all the tasks.","Yadav, Ramesh, Saha, Ekbal","https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2020.3020016","20200911","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16262,""
"Clinical Decision Support for the Diagnosis and Management of Adult and Pediatric Hypertension","To review literature from 2016 to 2019 on clinical decision support (CDS) for diagnosis and management of hypertension in children and adults. Ten studies described hypertension CDS systems. Novel advances included the integration of patient-collected blood pressure data, automated information retrieval and management support, and use of CDS in low-resource/developing-world settings and in pediatrics. Findings suggest that CDS increases hypertension detection/control, yet many children and adults with hypertension remain undetected or undercontrolled. CDS challenges included poor usability (from lack of health record integration, excessive data entry requests, and wireless connectivity challenges) and lack of clinician trust in blood pressure measures. Hypertension CDS has improved but not closed gaps in the detection and control of hypertension in children and adults. The studies reviewed indicate that the usability of CDS and the system where CDS is deployed (e.g., commitment to high-quality blood pressure measurement/infrastructure) may impact CDS's ability to increase hypertension detection and control.","Vuppala, Turer","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11906-020-01083-9","20200905","Clinical decision support; Electronic health record; High blood pressure; Hypertension; Pediatric hypertension","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16263,""
"Home Healthcare Clinical Notes Predict Patient Hospitalization and Emergency Department Visits","About 30% of home health care patients are hospitalized or visit an emergency department (ED) during a home health care (HHC) episode.

To identify patients at heightened risk hospitalization or ED visits using HHC narrative data (clinical notes). This study used a large database of HHC visit notes (n = 727,676) documented for 112,237 HHC episodes (89,459 unique patients) by clinicians of the largest nonprofit home health care agency in the United States. Text mining and machine learning algorithms (NaÃƒÂ¯ve Bayes, decision tree, random forest) were implemented to predict patient hospitalization or ED visits using the content of clinical notes. Risk factors associated with hospitalization or ED visits were identified using a feature selection technique (gain ratio attribute evaluation). Best performing text mining method (random forest) achieved good predictive performance. Seven risk factors categories were identified, with clinical factors, coordination/communication, and service use being the most frequent categories. This study was the first to explore the potential contribution of HHC clinical notes to identifying patients at risk for hospitalization or an ED visit. Our results suggest that HHC visit notes are highly informative and can contribute significantly to identification of patients at risk. Further studies are needed to explore ways to improve risk prediction by adding more data elements from additional data sources.","Topaz, Woo, Ryvicker, Zolnoori, Cato","https://doi.org/10.1097/NNR.0000000000000470","20201023","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16264,""
"Radiomics Based on CECT in Differentiating Kimura Disease From Lymph Node Metastases in Head and Neck: A Non-Invasive and Reliable Method","<b>Background:</b> Kimura disease may be easily misdiagnosed as malignant tumors such as lymph node metastases based on imaging and clinical symptoms. The aim of this article is to investigate whether the radiomic features and the model based on the features on venous-phase contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) images can distinguish Kimura disease from lymph node metastases in the head and neck. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis of 14 patients of head and neck Kimura disease (a total of 38 enlarged lymph nodes) and 39 patients with head and neck lymph node metastases (a total of 39 enlarged lymph nodes), confirmed by biopsy or surgery resection, was conducted. All patients accepted CECT within 10 days before biopsy or surgery resection. Radiomic features based on venous-phase CECT were generated automatically from Artificial-Intelligence Kit (AK) software. All lymph nodes were randomly divided into the training set (<i>n</i> = 54) and testing set (<i>n</i> = 23) in a ratio of 7:3. ANOVA + Mann-Whitney, Spearman correlation, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and Gradient Descent were introduced for the reduction of the highly redundant features. Binary logistic regression model was constructed based on the selected features. Receiver operating characteristic was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the features and the model. Finally, a nomogram was established for model application. <b>Results</b>: Seven features were screened out at the end. Significant difference was found between the two groups for all the features with area under the curves (AUCs) ranging from 0.759 to 0.915.

"Deep learning and feature based medication classifications from EEG in a large clinical data set","The amount of freely available human phenotypic data is increasing daily, and yet little is known about the types of inferences or identifying characteristics that could reasonably be drawn from that data using new statistical methods. One data type of particular interest is electroencephalographical (EEG) data, collected noninvasively from humans in various behavioral contexts. The Temple University EEG corpus associates thousands of hours of de-identified EEG records with contemporaneous physician reports that include metadata that might be expected to show a measurable correlation with characteristics of the recorded signal. Given that machine learning methods applied to neurological signals are being used in emerging diagnostic applications, we leveraged this data source to test the confidence with which algorithms could predict, using a patient's EEG record(s) as input, which medications were noted on the matching physician report. We comparatively assessed deep learning and feature-based approaches on their ability to distinguish between the assumed presence of Dilantin (phenytoin), Keppra (levetiracetam), or neither. Our methods could successfully distinguish between patients taking either anticonvulsant and those taking no medications; as well as between the two anticonvulsants. Further, we found different approaches to be most effective for different groups of classifications.","Nahmias, Civillico, Kontson","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70569-y","20200902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16266,""
"Searching for Programme theories for a realist evaluation: a case study comparing an academic database search and a simple Google search","Realist methodologies are increasingly being used to evaluate complex interventions in health and social care. Programme theory (ideas and assumptions of how a particular intervention works) development is the first step in a realist evaluation or a realist synthesis, with literature reviews providing important evidence to support this. Deciding how to search for programme theories is challenging and there is limited guidance available. Using an example of identifying programme theories for a realist evaluation of Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment Instruments in clinical practice, the authors explore and compare several different approaches to literature searching and highlight important methodological considerations for those embarking on a programme theory review. We compared the performance of an academic database search with a simple Google search and developed an optimised search strategy for the identification primary references (i.e. documents providing the clearest examples of programme theories) associated with the use of Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment Instruments (PU-RAIs). We identified the number of primary references and the total number of references retrieved per source. We then calculated the number needed to read (NNR) expressed as the total number of titles and abstracts screened to identify one relevant reference from each source. The academic database search (comprising CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, HMIC, Medline) identified 2 /10 primary references with a NNR of 1395.The Google search identified 7/10 primary references with a NNR of 10.1. The combined NNR was 286.3. The optimised search combining Google and CINAHL identified 10/10 primary references with a NNR of 40.2. The striking difference between the efficiency of the review's academic database and Google searches in finding relevant references prompted an in-depth comparison of the two types of search. The findings indicate the importance of including grey literature sources such as Google in this particular programme theory search, while acknowledging the need for transparency of methods. Further research is needed to facilitate improved guidance for programme theory searches to enhance practice in the realist field and to save researcher time and therefore resource.","Coleman, Wright, Nixon, Schoonhoven, Twiddy, Greenhalgh","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01084-x","20200829","Information retrieval; Internet; Literature searching; Programme theory; Realist evaluation; Scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16267,""
"Wearable Sensor-Based Sign Language Recognition: A Comprehensive Review","Sign language is used as a primary form of communication by many people who are Deaf, deafened, hard of hearing, and non-verbal. Communication barriers exist for members of these populations during daily interactions with those who are unable to understand or use sign language. Advancements in technology and machine learning techniques have led to the development of innovative approaches for gesture recognition. This literature review focuses on analyzing studies that use wearable sensor-based systems to classify sign language gestures. A review of 72 studies from 1991 to 2019 was performed to identify trends, best practices, and common challenges. Attributes including sign language variation, sensor configuration, classification method, study design, and performance metrics were analyzed and compared. Results from this literature review could aid in the development of user-centred and robust wearable sensor-based systems for sign language recognition.","Kudrinko, Flavin, Zhu, Li","https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2020.3019769","20200831","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16268,""

"A systematic review on recent trends in transmission, diagnosis, prevention and imaging features of COVID-19","As the new cases of COVID-19 are growing every daysince January 2020, the major way to control the spread wasthrough early diagnosis. Prevention and early diagnosis are the key strategies followed by most countries. This study presents the perspective of different modes of transmission of coronavirus,especially during clinical practices and among the pediatrics. Further, the diagnostic methods and the advancement of the computerized tomography have been discussed. Droplets, aerosol, and close contact are thesignificantfactors to transfer the infection to the suspect. This study predicts the possible transmission of the virus through medical practices such as ophthalmology, dental, and endoscopy procedures. With regard to pediatric transmission, as of now, only afew child fatalities had been reported. Childrenusually respond to the respiratory virus; however, COVID-19 response ison the contrary. The possibility of getting infected is minimal for the newborn. There has been no asymptomatic spread in children until now. Moreover, breastfeedingwould not transmit COVID-19, which is encouraging hygiene news for the pediatric. In addition, the current diagnostic methods for COVID-19 including Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)and chest computed topography(CT) scan, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) andimmunochromatographic fluorescence assay, are also discussed in detail. The introduction of artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithmhas the ability to diagnose COVID-19 in precise. However, the developments of a potential technology for the identification of the infection, such as a drone with thermal screening without human intervention, need to be encouraged.","Manigandan, Wu, Ponnusamy, Raghavendra, Pugazhendhi, Brindhadevi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2020.08.016","20200928","COVID-19; Coronaviruses; Pathogenesis; Reproduction number; SARS-CoV-2; Transmission","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16270,""
"Diagnosis of heart diseases by a secure Internet of Health Things system based on Autoencoder Deep Neural Network","Objective of this study is to introduce a secure IoHT system, which acts as a clinical decision support system with the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. In this sense, it was emphasized that the accuracy rate of diagnosis (classification) can be improved via deep learning algorithms, by needing no hybrid-complex models, and a secure data processing can be achieved with a multi-authentication and Tangle based approach. In detail, heart sounds were classified with Autoencoder Neural Networks (AEN) and the IoHT system was built for supporting doctors in real-time. For developing the diagnosis infrastructure by the AEN, PASCAL B-Training and Physiobank-PhysioNet A-Training heart sound datasets were used accordingly. For the PASCAL dataset, the AEN provided a diagnosis-classification performance with the accuracy of 100%, sensitivity of 100%, and the specificity of 100% whereas the rates were respectively 99.8%, 99.65%, and 99.13% for the PhysioNet dataset. It was seen that the findings by the developed AEN based solution were better than the alternative solutions from the literature. Additionally, usability of the whole IoHT system was found positive by the doctors, and according to the 479 real-case applications, the system was able to achieve accuracy rates of 96.03% for normal heart sounds, 91.91% for extrasystole, and 90.11% for murmur. In terms of security approach, the system was also robust against several attacking methods including synthetic data impute as well as trying to penetrating to the system via central system or mobile devices.","Deperlioglu, Kose, Gupta, Khanna, Sangaiah","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2020.08.011","20200928","Autoencoder neural networks; Deep learning; Heart diseases; Heart sounds classification; Secure internet of health things","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16271,""
"Comparing clotting factors attributes across different methods of preference elicitation in haemophilia patients","Emerging, systematic approaches for capturing patient input, such as preference elicitation, can provide valuable information for the benefit-risk assessment of medical products for treating bleeding disorders, such as haemophilia. This study aims to identify existing and develop new methods to capture, rank and summarize preference scores for clotting factor therapies. Haemophilia patient preference data were compiled from studies identified through literature review and publicly available US FDA patient-focused drug development meeting documents. Text mining was performed to identify major themes across studies. A standardized preference score was estimated and aggregated. Ten preference studies that employed qualitative (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3), and quantitative methods (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7) met the inclusion criteria. Text mining of qualitative and quantitative studies revealed similar themes as the standardized preference attribute importance. We found that seven quantitative studies employed discrete choice experiments (DCE)/conjoint analysis (CA) and examined a range of 5-12 attributes. For DCE/CA studies published prior to 2014 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4), safety attributes (inhibitor and viral safety) were among the most important attributes, accounting for ~46% of the total utility measured. DCE/CA studies published after 2014 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3) focused on frequency of infusion and reduction of bleeding risk, accounting for ~67% of the total utility. Interestingly, two studies that used different preference elicitation approaches (DCE and a monadic conjoint approach) both ranked infusion frequency as the most important attribute. Although there are few published patient preference studies for haemophilia, the results of this study can be viewed in the larger context of enhancing scientific methods of incorporating patient input in medical product development.","Tegenge, Belov, Moncur, Forshee, Irony","https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.14119","20200825","discrete choice experiments; patient preference; quantitative preference elicitation; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16272,""
"Imaging the &quot;social brain&quot; in schizophrenia: A systematic review of neuroimaging studies of social reward and punishment","Decreased social functioning and high levels of loneliness and social isolation are common in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD), contributing to reduced quality of life. One key contributor to social impairment is low social motivation, which may stem from aberrant neural processing of socially rewarding or punishing stimuli. To summarize research on the neurobiology of social motivation in SSD, we performed a systematic literature review of neuroimaging studies involving the presentation of social stimuli intended to elicit feelings of reward and/or punishment. Across 11 studies meeting criteria, people with SSD demonstrated weaker modulation of brain activity in regions within a proposed social interaction network, including prefrontal, cingulate, and striatal regions, as well as the amygdala and insula. Firm conclusions regarding neural differences in SSD in these regions, as well as connections within networks, are limited due to conceptual and methodological inconsistencies across the available studies. We conclude by making recommendations for the study of social reward and punishment processing in SSD in future research.","Mow, Gandhi, Fulford","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.08.005","20201012","Neuroimaging; Schizophrenia; Social punishment; Social reward; fMRI","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16273,""
"Point-of-care creatinine tests to assess kidney function for outpatients requiring contrast-enhanced CT imaging: systematic reviews and economic evaluation","Patients with low estimated glomerular filtration rates may be at higher risk of post-contrast acute kidney injury following contrast-enhanced computed tomography imaging. Point-of-care devices allow rapid measurement of estimated glomerular filtration rates for patients referred without a recent estimated glomerular filtration rate result. To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of point-of-care creatinine tests for outpatients without a recent estimated glomerular filtration rate measurement who need contrast-enhanced computed tomography imaging. Three systematic reviews of test accuracy, implementation and clinical outcomes, and economic analyses were carried out. Bibliographic databases were searched from inception to November 2018. Studies comparing the accuracy of point-of-care creatinine tests with laboratory reference tests to assess kidney function in adults in a non-emergency setting and studies reporting implementation and clinical outcomes were included. Risk of bias of diagnostic accuracy studies was assessed using a modified version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Probabilities of individuals having their estimated glomerular filtration rates correctly classified were estimated within a Bayesian framework and pooled using a fixed-effects model. A de novo probabilistic decision tree cohort model was developed to characterise the decision problem from an NHS and a Personal Social Services perspective. A range of alternative point-of-care testing approaches were considered. Scenario analyses were conducted. Fifty-four studies were included in the clinical reviews. Twelve studies reported diagnostic accuracy for estimated glomerular filtration rates; half were rated as being at low risk of bias, but there were applicability concerns for most. i-STAT (Abbott Point of Care, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA) and ABL (Radiometer Ltd, Crawley, UK) devices had higher probabilities of correctly classifying individuals in the same estimated glomerular filtration rate categories as the reference laboratory test than StatSensor<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> devices (Nova Biomedical, Runcorn, UK). There was limited evidence for epoc<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> (Siemens Healthineers AG, Erlangen, Germany) and Piccolo Xpress<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> (Abaxis, Inc., Union City, CA, USA) devices and no studies of DRI-CHEM NX 500 (Fujifilm Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The review of implementation and clinical outcomes included six studies showing practice variation in the management decisions when a point-of-care device indicated an abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate. The review of cost-effectiveness evidence identified no relevant studies. The de novo decision model that was developed included a total of 14 strategies. Owing to limited data, the model included only i-STAT, ABL800 FLEX and StatSensor. In the base-case analysis, the cost-effective strategy appeared to be a three-step testing sequence involving initially screening all individuals for risk factors, point-of-care testing for those individuals with at least one risk factor, and including a final confirmatory laboratory test for individuals with a point-of-care-positive test result. Within this testing approach, the specific point-of-care device with the highest net benefit was i-STAT, although differences in net benefit with StatSensor were very small. There was insufficient evidence for patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°30Ã¢â‚¬â€°ml/minute/1.73Ã¢â‚¬â€°m<sup>2</sup>, and on the full potential health impact of delayed or rescheduled computed tomography scans or the use of alternative imaging modalities. A three-step testing sequence combining a risk factor questionnaire with a point-of-care test and confirmatory laboratory testing appears to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources compared with current practice. The risk of contrast causing acute kidney injury to patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°30Ã¢â‚¬â€°ml/minute/1.73Ã¢â‚¬â€°m<sup>2</sup> is uncertain. Cost-effectiveness of point-of-care testing appears largely driven by the potential of point-of-care tests to minimise delays within the current computed tomography pathway. Studies evaluating the impact of risk-stratifying questionnaires on workflow outcomes in computed tomography patients without recent estimated glomerular filtration rate results are needed. This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42018115818. This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in <i>Health Technology Assessment</i>; Vol. 24, No. 39. See the NIHR Journals Library website for further project information. Before computed tomography scans are done, a contrast agent is usually needed to improve the visibility of internal body structures. After receiving a contrast agent (through a vein), some patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ kidneys may be affected, especially if their kidneys already do not work well. A blood test can identify these patients before a computed tomography scan, to reduce the risk of kidney harm. The blood test measures creatinine, which is a marker of how well the kidneys work. Before a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan, some patients have a recent creatinine result from an earlier blood test. Blood tests are normally done in a central laboratory, and usually take at least 1 hour. Other patients do not have a recent creatinine result, so their computed tomography scan may be delayed or rearranged. Sometimes, to avoid risking kidney harm, patients may have scans without contrast. Ã¢â‚¬ËœPoint-of-careÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (handheld, tabletop or portable) devices can quickly measure creatinine (usually in patients with risk factors), often from a finger-prick blood sample. Many point-of-care devices are available but they may not be as exact as laboratory tests, so their benefit is unclear. This study reviewed all available evidence on the benefits and harms of point-of-care creatinine tests before computed tomography scans and assessed whether or not they are a cost-effective use of NHS resources. The study found that some devices [i.e. i-STAT (Abbott Point of Care, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA) and ABL (Radiometer Ltd, Crawley, UK)] were more accurate than others [i.e. StatSensor<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> (Nova Biomedical, Runcorn, UK)]. There was insufficient evidence for other devices. The study found that, for outpatients, doing a point-of-care test in patients who are at a higher risk of kidney harm (according to a questionnaire) and then confirming this with a laboratory test appeared to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources. The study found that the risk of kidney harm as a result of contrast agents appears very low. The main benefit of point-of-care testing may be to reduce needless delays or rearranged computed tomography scan appointments.","Corbett, Duarte, Llewellyn, Altunkaya, Harden, Harris, Walker, Palmer, Dias, Soares","https://doi.org/10.3310/hta24390","20200908","ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY; CREATININE; GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE; OUTPATIENTS; POINT-OF-CARE TESTING; TOMOGRAPHY X-RAY COMPUTED","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16274,""

We screened articles for eligibility, assessed quality, extracted, and summarized the data from included articles. We formulated recommendations based on the evidence and clinical judgment. Of 3647 articles identified, 70 articles from 14 countries were included. The prevalence of CRF in CAYA cancer survivors ranged from 10-85%. We recommend that healthcare providers are aware of the risk of CRF, implement regular screening with validated measures, and recommend effective interventions to fatigued survivors. A considerable proportion of CAYA cancer survivors suffers from CRF even years after the end of treatment. We recommend that healthcare providers adopt regular screening to detect and treat CRF early and positively influence survivors' health and quality of life.","Christen, Roser, Mulder, Ilic, Lie, Loonen, Mellblom, Kremer, Hudson, Constine, Skinner, Scheinemann, Gilleland Marchak, Michel","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11764-020-00904-9","20201022","Cancer-related fatigue; Childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer; Evidence-based guidelines; Late effects; Surveillance; Survivors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16275,""
"Automated and partly automated contact tracing: a systematic review to inform the control of COVID-19","Evidence for the use of automated or partly automated contact-tracing tools to contain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is scarce. We did a systematic review of automated or partly automated contact tracing. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, OVID Global Health, EBSCO Medical COVID Information Portal, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, and Google Advanced for articles relevant to COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, influenza, or Ebola virus, published from Jan 1, 2000, to April 14, 2020. We also included studies identified through professional networks up to April 30, 2020. We reviewed all full-text manuscripts. Primary outcomes were the number or proportion of contacts (or subsequent cases) identified. Secondary outcomes were indicators of outbreak control, uptake, resource use, cost-effectiveness, and lessons learnt. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020179822). Of the 4036 studies identified, 110 full-text studies were reviewed and 15 studies were included in the final analysis and quality assessment. No empirical evidence of the effectiveness of automated contact tracing (regarding contacts identified or transmission reduction) was identified. Four of seven included modelling studies that suggested that controlling COVID-19 requires a high population uptake of automated contact-tracing apps (estimates from 56% to 95%), typically alongside other control measures. Studies of partly automated contact tracing generally reported more complete contact identification and follow-up compared with manual systems. Automated contact tracing could potentially reduce transmission with sufficient population uptake. However, concerns regarding privacy and equity should be considered. Well designed prospective studies are needed given gaps in evidence of effectiveness, and to investigate the integration and relative effects of manual and automated systems. Large-scale manual contact tracing is therefore still key in most contexts.","Braithwaite, Callender, Bullock, Aldridge","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30184-9","20201022","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16276,""
"Artificial intelligence for decision support in acute stroke - current roles and potential","The identification and treatment of patients with stroke is becoming increasingly complex as more treatment options become available and new relationships between disease features and treatment response are continually discovered. Consequently, clinicians must constantly learn new skills (such as clinical evaluations or image interpretation), stay up to date with the literature and incorporate advances into everyday practice. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to support clinical decision making could reduce inter-rater variation in routine clinical practice and facilitate the extraction of vital information that could improve identification of patients with stroke, prediction of treatment responses and patient outcomes. Such support systems would be ideal for centres that deal with few patients with stroke or for regional hubs, and could assist informed discussions with the patients and their families. Moreover, the use of AI for image processing and interpretation in stroke could provide any clinician with an imaging assessment equivalent to that of an expert. However, any AI-based decision support system should allow for expert clinician interaction to enable identification of errors (for example, in automated image processing). In this Review, we discuss the increasing importance of imaging in stroke management before exploring the potential and pitfalls of AI-assisted treatment decision support in acute stroke.","Bivard, Churilov, Parsons","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-020-0390-y","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16277,""
"Safety, time and cost evaluation of automated and semi-automated drug distribution systems in hospitals: a systematic review","To systematically review automated and semi-automated drug distribution systems (DDSs) in hospitals and to evaluate their effectiveness on medication safety, time and costs of medication care. A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE Ovid, Scopus, CINAHL and EMB Reviews covering the period 2005 to May 2016. Studies were included if they (1) concerned technologies used in the drug distribution and administration process in acute care hospitals and (2) reported medication safety, time and cost-related outcomes. Key outcomes, conclusions and recommendations of the included studies (n=30) were categorised according to the dispensing method: decentralised (n=19 studies), centralised (n=6) or hybrid system (n=5). Patient safety improved (n=27) with automation, and reduction in medication errors was found in all three systems. Centralised and decentralised systems were reported to support clinical pharmacy practice in hospitals. The impact of the medication distribution system on time allocation such as labour time, staffing workload or changes in work process was explored in the majority of studies (n=24). Six studies explored economic outcomes. No medication distribution system was found to be better than another in terms of outcomes assessed in the studies included in the systematic review. All DDSs improved medication safety and quality of care, mainly by decreasing medication errors. However, many error types still remained-for example, prescribing errors. Centralised and hybrid systems saved more time than a decentralised system. Costs of medication care were reduced in decentralised systems mainly in high-expense units. However, no evidence was shown that implementation of decentralised systems in small units would save costs. More comparable evidence on the benefits and costs of decentralised and hybrid systems should be available. Changes in processes due to a new DDS may create new medication safety risks; to minimise these risks, training and reallocation of staff resources are needed.","Ahtiainen, Kallio, Airaksinen, HolmstrÃƒÂ¶m","https://doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2018-001791","20200902","Health &amp; safety; clinical pharmacy; dispensing robots; drug storage and distribution; hospital pharmacy automation; medical errors; systematic review; uni dose system","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16278,""
"LAITOR4HPC: A text mining pipeline based on HPC for building interaction networks","The amount of published full-text articles has increased dramatically. Text mining tools configure an essential approach to building biological networks, updating databases and providing annotation for new pathways. PESCADOR is an online web server based on LAITOR and NLProt text mining tools, which retrieves protein-protein co-occurrences in a tabular-based format, adding a network schema. Here we present an HPC-oriented version of PESCADOR's native text mining tool, renamed to LAITOR4HPC, aiming to access an unlimited abstract amount in a short time to enrich available networks, build new ones and possibly highlight whether fields of research have been exhaustively studied. By taking advantage of parallel computing HPC infrastructure, the full collection of MEDLINE abstracts available until June 2017 was analyzed in a shorter period (6 days) when compared to the original online implementation (with an estimated 2 years to run the same data). Additionally, three case studies were presented to illustrate LAITOR4HPC usage possibilities. The first case study targeted soybean and was used to retrieve an overview of published co-occurrences in a single organism, retrieving 15,788 proteins in 7894 co-occurrences. In the second case study, a target gene family was searched in many organisms, by analyzing 15 species under biotic stress. Most co-occurrences regarded Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays. The third case study concerned the construction and enrichment of an available pathway. Choosing A. thaliana for further analysis, the defensin pathway was enriched, showing additional signaling and regulation molecules, and how they respond to each other in the modulation of this complex plant defense response. LAITOR4HPC can be used for an efficient text mining based construction of biological networks derived from big data sources, such as MEDLINE abstracts. Time consumption and data input limitations will depend on the available resources at the HPC facility.

"Evidence-Based Medicine in Otolaryngology, Part XI: Modeling and Analysis to Support Decisions","To provide a resource to educate clinical decision makers about the analyses and models that can be employed to support data-driven choices. Published studies and literature regarding decision analysis, decision trees, and models used to support clinical decisions. Decision models provide insights into the evidence and its implications for those who make choices about clinical care and resource allocation. Decision models are designed to further our understanding and allow exploration of the common problems that we face, with parameters derived from the best available evidence. Analysis of these models demonstrates critical insights and uncertainties surrounding key problems via a readily interpretable yet quantitative format. This 11th installment of the Evidence-Based Medicine in Otolaryngology series thus provides a step-by-step introduction to decision models, their typical framework, and favored approaches to inform data-driven practice for patient-level decisions, as well as comparative assessments of proposed health interventions for larger populations. Information to support decisions may arise from tools such as decision trees, Markov models, microsimulation models, and dynamic transmission models. These data can help guide choices about competing or alternative approaches to health care. Methods have been developed to support decisions based on data. Understanding the related techniques may help promote an evidence-based approach to clinical management and policy.","Caulley, Hunink, Randolph, Shin","https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820948827","20200825","Markov model; comparative effectiveness; decision analysis; decision sciences; decision tree; dynamic transmission model; evidence-based medicine; microsimulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16280,""
"Machine learning based approaches for detecting COVID-19 using clinical text data","Technology advancements have a rapid effect on every field of life, be it medical field or any other field. Artificial intelligence has shown the promising results in health care through its decision making by analysing the data. COVID-19 has affected more than 100 countries in a matter of no time. People all over the world are vulnerable to its consequences in future. It is imperative to develop a control system that will detect the coronavirus. One of the solution to control the current havoc can be the diagnosis of disease with the help of various AI tools. In this paper, we classified textual clinical reports into four classes by using classical and ensemble machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering was performed using techniques like Term frequency/inverse document frequency (TF/IDF), Bag of words (BOW) and report length. These features were supplied to traditional and ensemble machine learning classifiers. Logistic regression and Multinomial NaÃƒÂ¯ve Bayes showed better results than other ML algorithms by having 96.2% testing accuracy. In future recurrent neural network can be used for better accuracy.","Khanday, Rabani, Khan, Rouf, Mohi Ud Din","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41870-020-00495-9","20200928","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Ensemble; Imperative; Machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16281,""

"Pathological lung segmentation based on random forest combined with deep model and multi-scale superpixels","Accurate segmentation of lungs in pathological thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans plays an important role in pulmonary disease diagnosis. However, it is still a challenging task due to the variability of pathological lung appearances and shapes. In this paper, we proposed a novel segmentation algorithm based on random forest (RF), deep convolutional network, and multi-scale superpixels for segmenting pathological lungs from thoracic CT images accurately. A pathological thoracic CT image is first segmented based on multi-scale superpixels, and deep features, texture, and intensity features extracted from superpixels are taken as inputs of a group of RF classifiers. With the fusion of classification results of RFs by a fractional-order gray correlation approach, we capture an initial segmentation of pathological lungs. We finally utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy to deal with segmentation refinement combining contour correction of left lungs and region repairing of right lungs. Our algorithm is tested on a group of thoracic CT images affected with interstitial lung diseases. Experiments show that our algorithm can achieve a high segmentation accuracy with an average DSC of 96.45% and PPV of 95.07%. Compared with several existing lung segmentation methods, our algorithm exhibits a robust performance on pathological lung segmentation. Our algorithm can be employed reliably for lung field segmentation of pathologic thoracic CT images with a high accuracy, which is helpful to assist radiologists to detect the presence of pulmonary diseases and quantify its shape and size in regular clinical practices.","Liu, Zhao, Xie, Pang","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11063-020-10330-8","20200928","Convolutional neural network; Divide-and-conquer strategy; Pathological lung segmentation; Random forest","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16283,""
"Feature-Based Learning in Drug Prescription System for Medical Clinics","Rapid increases in data volume and variety pose a challenge to safe drug prescription for health professionals like doctors and dentists. This is addressed by our study, which presents innovative approaches in mining data from drug corpus and extracting feature vectors to combine this knowledge with individual patient medical profiles. Within our three-tiered framework-the prediction layer, the knowledge layer and the presentation layer-we describe multiple approaches in computing similarity ratios from the feature vectors, illustrated with an example of applying the framework in a typical medical clinic. Experimental evaluation shows that the word embedding model performs better than the adverse network model, with a <i>F</i> score of 0.75. The <i>F</i> score is a common metrics used for evaluating the performance of classification algorithms. Similarity to a drug the patient is allergic to or is taking are important considerations for the suitability of a drug for prescription.

"ADDI: Recommending alternatives for drug-drug interactions with negative health effects","Investigating the interactions among various drugs is an indispensable issue in the field of computational biology. Scientific literature represents a rich source for the retrieval of knowledge about the interactions between drugs. Predicting drug-drug interaction (DDI) types will help biologists to evade hazardous drug interactions and support them in discovering potential alternatives that increase therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity. In this paper, we propose a general-purpose method called ADDI (standing for Alternative Drug-Drug Interaction) that applies deep learning on PubMed abstracts to predict interaction types among drugs. As an application, ADDI recommends alternatives for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) which have Negative Health Effects Types (NHETs). ADDI clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, on average by 13%, with respect to accuracy by using only the textual content of the online PubMed papers. Additionally, manual evaluation of ADDI indicates high precision in recommending alternatives for DDIs with NHETs.","Allahgholi, Rahmani, Javdani, Weiss, MÃƒÂ³dos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103969","20201027","Alternative drug recommendation; Deep learning; DrugÃ¢â‚¬â€œdrug interactions; Negative health effects; Text mining; Word embedding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16285,""
"Preventive healthcare policies in the US: solutions for disease management using Big Data Analytics","Data-driven healthcare policy discussions are gaining traction after the Covid-19 outbreak and ahead of the 2020 US presidential elections. The US has a hybrid healthcare structure; it is a system that does not provide universal coverage, albeit few years ago enacted a mandate (Affordable Care Act-ACA) that provides coverage for the majority of Americans. The US has the highest health expenditure per capita of all western and developed countries; however, most Americans don't tap into the benefits of preventive healthcare. It is estimated that only 8% of Americans undergo routine preventive screenings. On a national level, very few states (15 out of the 50) have above-average preventive healthcare metrics. In literature, many studies focus on the cure of diseases (research areas such as drug discovery and disease prediction); whilst a minority have examined data-driven preventive measures-a matter that Americans and policy makers ought to place at the forefront of national issues. In this work, we present solutions for preventive practices and policies through Machine Learning (ML) methods. ML is morally neutral, it depends on the data that train the models; in this work, we make the case that Big Data is an imperative paradigm for healthcare. We examine disparities in clinical data for US patients by developing correlation and imputation methods for data completeness. Non-conventional patterns are identified. The data lifecycle followed is methodical and deliberate; 1000+Ã¢â‚¬â€°clinical, demographical, and laboratory variables are collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Multiple statistical models are deployed (Pearson correlations, Cramer'sÃ‚Â V, MICE, and ANOVA). Other unsupervised ML models are also examined (K-modes and K-prototypes for clustering). Through the results presented in the paper, pointers to preventive chronic disease tests are presented, and the models are tested and evaluated.","Batarseh, Ghassib, Chong, Su","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40537-020-00315-8","20200928","Big Data Analytics; Chronic diseases; Data incompleteness and imputation; PatientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ clustering; Preventive healthcare policy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16286,""
"Bayesian networks for supply chain risk, resilience and ripple effect analysis: A literature review","In the broad sense, the Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that possess unique methodical features to model dependencies in complex networks, such as forward and backward propagation (inference) of disruptions. BNs have transitioned from an emerging topic to a growing research area in supply chain (SC) resilience and risk analysis. As a result, there is an acute need to review existing literature to ascertain recent developments and uncover future areas of research. Despite the increasing number of publications on BNs in the domain of SC uncertainty, an extensive review on their application to SC risk and resilience is lacking. To address this gap, we analyzed research articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals from 2007 to 2019 using network analysis, visualization-based scientometric analysis, and clustering analysis. Through this study, we contribute to literature by discussing the challenges of current research, and, more importantly, identifying and proposing future research directions. The results of our survey show that further debate on the theory and application of BNs to SC resilience and risk management is a significant area of interest for both academics and practitioners. The applications of BNs, and their conjunction with machine learning algorithms to solve big data SC problems relating to uncertainty and risk, are also discussed.","Hosseini, Ivanov","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113649","20200928","BN, Bayesian Network; BP, Backward Propagation; Bayesian network; CPT, Conditional Probability Table; DAG, Directed Acyclic Graph; DBN, Dynamic Bayesian Network; EU, Expected Utility; FMEA, Failure Mode Effects &amp; Analysis; FP, Forward Propagation; JPD, Joint Probability Distribution; MCS, Monte Carlo Simulation; MF, Manufacturing Facility; Machine learning; OEM, Original Equipment Manufacturer; Ripple effect; SC, Supply Chain; SCRM, Supply Chain Risk Management; Supply chain management; Supply chain resilience; TEU, Total Expected Utility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16287,""
"Improving Intranasal Naloxone Prescribing Through EMR Modification and Automation","In 2017, approximately 11.4 million Americans used opioids inappropriately. Nearly 47,600 deaths in 2017 were attributable to overdose on opioids. Intranasal naloxone was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015 as a rescue medication for opioid overdose. New York State launched a prescription drug monitoring program in 2012, the Internet System for Tracking Over-Prescribing (I-STOP), that required completion before dispensing any controlled substance. Currently, prescribing naloxone at our institution requires 10 clicks and 2 free text boxes. The goal of this project was to increase the prescribing of intranasal naloxone by utilizing EMR automation and visualization tools. Our intervention embedded a section within the required I-STOP note, displaying the last date naloxone was prescribed and an option to &quot;prescribe intranasal naloxone.&quot; If checked, a prepopulated order dialog box was generated. Intranasal naloxone orders for the institution totaled 65 for 2 months before the intervention and 203 for 2 months after the intervention, with 112 (55%) coming directly from the I-STOP note modification. Ease of prescribing improved as total clicks were reduced from 10 to 2, and free text boxes from 2 to 0. Our findings suggest that a clinical decision support system can be an effective way to increase hospital-wide naloxone prescribing rates. We were able to increase prescribing rates by more than three-fold, significantly increasing the availability of a rescue medication to individuals at high-risk for overdose. Intranasal naloxone prescribing increased with the implementation of a visual reminder and a more intuitive ordering experience while preserving provider autonomy.","Crusco, Smith, Rajupet","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000724","20200824","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16288,""

"Predicting rate of cognitive decline at baseline using a deep neural network with multidata analysis","<b>Purpose:</b> Our study investigates whether a machine-learning-based system can predict the rate of cognitive decline in mildly cognitively impaired patients by processing only the clinical and imaging data collected at the initial visit. <b>Approach:</b> We built a predictive model based on a supervised hybrid neural network utilizing a three-dimensional convolutional neural network to perform volume analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and integration of nonimaging clinical data at the fully connected layer of the architecture. The experiments are conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. <b>Results:</b> Experimental results confirm that there is a correlation between cognitive decline and the data obtained at the first visit. The system achieved an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.70 for cognitive decline class prediction. <b>Conclusion:</b> To our knowledge, this is the first study that predicts &quot;slowly deteriorating/stable&quot; or &quot;rapidly deteriorating&quot; classes by processing routinely collected baseline clinical and demographic data [baseline MRI, baseline mini-mental state examination (MMSE), scalar volumetric data, age, gender, education, ethnicity, and race].

"Efficient Deep Learning Architecture for Detection and Recognition of Thyroid Nodules","Ultrasonography is widely used in the clinical diagnosis of thyroid nodules. Ultrasound images of thyroid nodules have different appearances, interior features, and blurred borders that are difficult for a physician to diagnose into malignant or benign types merely through visual recognition. The development of artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, has led to great advances in the field of medical image diagnosis. However, there are some challenges to achieve precision and efficiency in the recognition of thyroid nodules. In this work, we propose a deep learning architecture, you only look once v3 dense multireceptive fields convolutional neural network (YOLOv3-DMRF), based on YOLOv3. It comprises a DMRF-CNN and multiscale detection layers. In DMRF-CNN, we integrate dilated convolution with different dilation rates to continue passing the edge and the texture features to deeper layers. Two different scale detection layers are deployed to recognize the different sizes of the thyroid nodules. We used two datasets to train and evaluate the YOLOv3-DMRF during the experiments. One dataset includes 699 original ultrasound images of thyroid nodules collected from a local health physical center. We obtained 10,485 images after data augmentation. Another dataset is an open-access dataset that includes ultrasound images of 111 malignant and 41 benign thyroid nodules. Average precision (AP) and mean average precision (mAP) are used as the metrics for quantitative and qualitative evaluations. We compared the proposed YOLOv3-DMRF with some state-of-the-art deep learning networks. The experimental results show that YOLOv3-DMRF outperforms others on mAP and detection time on both the datasets. Specifically, the values of mAP and detection time were 90.05 and 95.23% and 3.7 and 2.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°s, respectively, on the two test datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed YOLOv3-DMRF is efficient for detection and recognition of thyroid nodules for ultrasound images.","Ma, Duan, Zhang, Wang, Wang, Li, Li, Zhang, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/1242781","20200825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16291,""
"Wound assessment, imaging and monitoring systems in diabetic foot ulcers: A systematic review","Patients with diabetes mellitus have a lifetime risk of 15% to 25% of developing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). DFU is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Wound imaging systems are useful adjuncts in monitoring of wound progress. Our study aims to review existing literature on the available wound assessment and monitoring systems for DFU. This is a systematic review of articles from PubMed and Embase (1974 - March 2020). All studies related to wound assessment or monitoring systems in DFUs were included. Articles on other types of wounds, review articles, and non-English texts were excluded. Outcomes include clinical use, wound measurement statistics, hospital system integration, and other advantages and challenges. The search identified 531 articles. Seventeen full-text studies were eligible for the final analysis. Five modalities were identified: (a) computer applications or hand-held devices (n = 5), (b) mobile applications (n = 2), (c) optical imaging (n = 2), (d) spectroscopy or hyperspectral imaging (n = 4), and (e) artificial intelligence (n = 4). Most studies (n = 16) reported on wound assessment or monitoring. Only one study reported on data capturing. Two studies on the use of computer applications reported low inter-observer variability in wound measurement (inter-rater reliability &gt;0.99, and inter-observer variability 15.9% respectively). Hand-held commercial devices demonstrated high accuracy (relative error of 2.1%-6.8%). Use of spectroscopy or hyperspectral imaging in prediction of wound healing has a sensitivity and specificity of 80% to 90% and 74%to 86%, respectively. Majority of the commercially available wound assessment systems have not been reviewed in the literature on measurement accuracy. In conclusion, most imaging systems are superior to traditional wound assessment. Wound imaging systems should be used as adjuncts in DFU monitoring.","Chan, Lo","https://doi.org/10.1111/iwj.13481","20200824","artificial intelligence; diabetic foot; mobile applications; wound healing; wounds and injuries","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16292,""
"Integrative blockwise sparse analysis for tissue characterization and classification","The topic of sparse representation of samples in high dimensional spaces has attracted growing interest during the past decade. In this work, we develop sparse representation-based methods for classification of clinical imaging patterns into healthy and diseased states. We propose a spatial block decomposition method to address irregularities of the approximation problem and to build an ensemble of classifiers that we expect to yield more accurate numerical solutions than conventional sparse analyses of the complete spatial domain of the images. We introduce two classification decision strategies based on maximum a posteriori probability (BBMAP), or a log likelihood function (BBLL) and an approach to adjusting the classification decision criteria. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach we used cross-validation techniques on imaging datasets with disease class labels. We first applied the proposed approach to diagnosis of osteoporosis using bone radiographs. In this problem we assume that changes in trabecular bone connectivity can be captured by intensity patterns. The second application domain is separation of breast lesions into benign and malignant categories in mammograms. The object classes in both of these applications are not linearly separable, and the classification accuracy may depend on the lesion size in the second application. Our results indicate that the proposed integrative sparse analysis addresses the ill-posedness of the approximation problem and produces very good class separation for trabecular bone characterization and for breast lesion characterization. Our approach yields higher classification rates than conventional sparse classification and previously published convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that we fine-tuned for our datasets, or utilized for feature extraction. The BBLL technique also produced higher classification rates than learners using hand-crafted texture features, and the Bag of Keypoints, which is a sophisticated patch-based method. Furthermore, our comparative experiments showed that the BBLL function may yield more accurate classification than BBMAP, because BBLL accounts for possible estimation bias.","Zheng, Harris, Jennane, Makrogiannis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101885","20201023","Computer-aided diagnosis; Ensemble classifiers; Sparse representation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16293,""
"Review of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) contamination in Chinese soils","Despite a ban on the production and use of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) after 1983, serious OCP pollution still exists in the soil in certain areas of China because OCPs degrade very slowly. Based on a systematic review, we identified 136 relevant papers focusing on soil contamination from hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in China (published from 2001 to 2019). We compiled scientific data, extracted and analyzed relevant information, and summarized the pollution characteristics of HCH and DDT in Chinese soils found in two land use types: agricultural land and land for construction. Related studies on HCH and DDT in Chinese soils focus on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas, where agricultural soils are predominant. The average concentrations of both HCH and DDT in agricultural soils were generally lower than the risk screening value (100Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼g/kg) in most provinces in China, except for DDT concentrations in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. However, in certain central and eastern regions, mean or maximum recorded DDT concentrations approaching or exceeding 100Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼g/kg were recorded. Regarding land for construction, soils with excessive concentrations of HCH and DDT were primarily observed at sites of operational or defunct pesticide factories. According to isomer and metabolite compositions, HCH and DDT at most sites originated from historical residues, but others may have been new inputs after 1983. Since 2015, the concentrations of HCH and DDT in agricultural soils in China have been decreasing, and those in the soils of land for construction (except for sites of operational or defunct pesticide factories) have not exceeded the standard after 2005. This indicates that the measures to prohibit the production and use of OCPs in China have been effective. However, the management of operational or defunct pesticide factories polluted by OCPs requires further improvement.","Ma, Yun, Ruan, Lu, Shi, Qin, Men, Zou, Du, Xing, Xie","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141212","20200826","Agricultural land; DDT; HCH; Land for construction; Literature review; Soil contamination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16294,""

"The Role of EEG in the Diagnosis, Prognosis and Clinical Correlations of Dementia with Lewy Bodies-A Systematic Review","Despite improvements in diagnostic criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the ability to discriminate DLB from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias remains suboptimal. Electroencephalography (EEG) is currently a supportive biomarker in the diagnosis of DLB. We performed a systematic review to better clarify the diagnostic and prognostic role of EEG in DLB and define the clinical correlates of various EEG features described in DLB. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched using search strategies for relevant articles up to 6 August 2020. We included 43 studies comparing EEG in DLB with other diagnoses, 42 of them included a comparison of DLB with AD, 10 studies compared DLB with Parkinson's disease dementia, and 6 studies compared DLB with other dementias. The studies were visual EEG assessment (6), quantitative EEG (35) and event-related potential studies (2). The most consistent observation was the slowing of the dominant EEG rhythm (&lt;8 Hz) assessed visually or through quantitative EEG, which was observed in ~90% of patients with DLB and only ~10% of patients with AD. Other findings based on qualitative rating, spectral power analyses, connectivity, microstate and machine learning algorithms were largely heterogenous due to differences in study design, EEG acquisition, preprocessing and analysis. EEG protocols should be standardized to allow replication and validation of promising EEG features as potential biomarkers in DLB.","Law, Todd, Mehraram, Schumacher, Baker, LeBeau, Yarnall, Onofrj, Bonanni, Thomas, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10090616","20201020","dementia with lewy bodies; electroencephalography; electrophysiology; lewy body disease; parkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease dementia; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16296,""
"Artificial Intelligence and Suicide Prevention: A Systematic Review of Machine Learning Investigations","Suicide is a leading cause of death that defies prediction and challenges prevention efforts worldwide. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as a means of investigating large datasets to enhance risk detection. A systematic review of ML investigations evaluating suicidal behaviors was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE, PsychInfo, Web-of-Science, and EMBASE, employing search strings and MeSH terms relevant to suicide and AI. Databases were supplemented by hand-search techniques and Google Scholar. Inclusion criteria: (1) journal article, available in English, (2) original investigation, (3) employment of AI/ML, (4) evaluation of a suicide risk outcome. N = 594 records were identified based on abstract search, and 25 hand-searched reports. N = 461 reports remained after duplicates were removed, n = 316 were excluded after abstract screening. Of n = 149 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, n = 87 were included for quantitative synthesis, grouped according to suicide behavior outcome. Reports varied widely in methodology and outcomes. Results suggest high levels of risk classification accuracy (&gt;90%) and Area Under the Curve (AUC) in the prediction of suicidal behaviors.

"From Patient Engagement to Precision Oncology: Leveraging Informatics to Advance Cancer Care","Conduct a survey of the literature for advancements in cancer informatics over the last three years in three specific areas where there has been unprecedented growth: 1) digital health; 2) machine learning; and 3) precision oncology. We also highlight the ethical implications and future opportunities within each area. A search was conducted over a three-year period in two electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar) to identify peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings. Search terms included variations of the following: neoplasms[MeSH], informatics[MeSH], cancer, oncology, clinical cancer informatics, medical cancer informatics. The search returned too many articles for practical review (23,994 from PubMed and 23,100 from Google Scholar). Thus, we conducted searches of key PubMed-indexed informatics journals and proceedings. We further limited our search to manuscripts that demonstrated a clear focus on clinical or translational cancer informatics. Manuscripts were then selected based on their methodological rigor, scientific impact, innovation, and contribution towards cancer informatics as a field or on their impact on cancer care and research. Key developments and opportunities in cancer informatics research in the areas of digital health, machine learning, and precision oncology were summarized. While there are numerous innovations in the field of cancer informatics to advance prevention and clinical care, considerable challenges remain related to data sharing and privacy, digital accessibility, and algorithm biases and interpretation. The implementation and application of these findings in cancer care necessitates further consideration and research.","Griffin, Topaloglu, Davis, Chung","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1701983","20200825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16298,""
"Precision, Equity, and Public Health and Epidemiology Informatics - A Scoping Review","This scoping review synthesizes the recent literature on precision public health and the influence of predictive models on health equity with the intent to highlight central concepts for each topic and identify research opportunities for the biomedical informatics community. Searches were conducted using PubMed for publications between 2017-01-01 and 2019-12-31. Precision public health is defined as the use of data and evidence to tailor interventions to the characteristics of a single population. It differs from precision medicine in terms of its focus on populations and the limited role of human genomics. High-resolution spatial analysis in a global health context and application of genomics to infectious organisms are areas of progress. Opportunities for informatics research include (i) the development of frameworks for measuring non-clinical concepts, such as social position, (ii) the development of methods for learning from similar populations, and (iii) the evaluation of precision public health implementations. Just as the effects of interventions can differ across populations, predictive models can perform systematically differently across subpopulations due to information bias, sampling bias, random error, and the choice of the output. Algorithm developers, professional societies, and governments can take steps to prevent and mitigate these biases. However, even if the steps to avoid bias are clear in theory, they can be very challenging to accomplish in practice. Both precision public health and predictive modelling require careful consideration in how subpopulations are defined and access to data on subpopulations can be challenging. While the theory for both topics has advanced considerably, there is much work to be done in understanding how to implement and evaluate these approaches in practice.","Buckeridge","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1701989","20200825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16299,""
"Clinical Research Informatics","To summarize key contributions to current research in the field of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) and to select best papers published in 2019. A bibliographic search using a combination of MeSH descriptors and free-text terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus meeting between the two section editors and the editorial team was organized to finally conclude on the selected three best papers. Among the 517 papers, published in 2019, returned by the search, that were in the scope of the various areas of CRI, the full review process selected three best papers. The first best paper describes the use of a homomorphic encryption technique to enable federated analysis of real-world data while complying more easily with data protection requirements. The authors of the second best paper demonstrate the evidence value of federated data networks reporting a large real world data study related to the first line treatment for hypertension. The third best paper reports the migration of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system database to the OMOP common data model. This work opens the combined analysis of both spontaneous reporting system and electronic health record (EHR) data for pharmacovigilance. The most significant research efforts in the CRI field are currently focusing on real world evidence generation and especially the reuse of EHR data. With the progress achieved this year in the areas of phenotyping, data integration, semantic interoperability, and data quality assessment, real world data is becoming more accessible and reusable. High quality data sets are key assets not only for large scale observational studies or for changing the way clinical trials are conducted but also for developing or evaluating artificial intelligence algorithms guiding clinical decision for more personalized care. And lastly, security and confidentiality, ethical and regulatory issues, and more generally speaking data governance are still active research areas this year.","Daniel, Kalra","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1702007","20200825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16300,""
"Review of Clinical Research Informatics","Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) declares its scope in its name, but its content, both in terms of the clinical research it supports-and sometimes initiates-and the methods it has developed over time, reach much further than the name suggests. The goal of this review is to celebrate the extraordinary diversity of activity and of results, not as a prize-giving pageant, but in recognition of the field, the community that both serves and is sustained by it, and of its interdisciplinarity and its international dimension. Beyond personal awareness of a range of work commensurate with the author's own research, it is clear that, even with a thorough literature search, a comprehensive review is impossible. Moreover, the field has grown and subdivided to an extent that makes it very hard for one individual to be familiar with every branch or with more than a few branches in any depth. A literature survey was conducted that focused on informatics-related terms in the general biomedical and healthcare literature, and specific concerns (&quot;artificial intelligence&quot;, &quot;data models&quot;, &quot;analytics&quot;, etc.) in the biomedical informatics (BMI) literature. In addition to a selection from the results from these searches, suggestive references within them were also considered. The substantive sections of the paper-Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and &quot;Big Data&quot; Analytics; Common Data Models, Data Quality, and Standards; Phenotyping and Cohort Discovery; Privacy: Deidentification, Distributed Computation, Blockchain; Causal Inference and Real-World Evidence-provide broad coverage of these active research areas, with, no doubt, a bias towards this reviewer's interests and preferences, landing on a number of papers that stood out in one way or another, or, alternatively, exemplified a particular line of work. CRI is thriving, not only in the familiar major centers of research, but more widely, throughout the world. This is not to pretend that the distribution is uniform, but to highlight the potential for this domain to play a prominent role in supporting progress in medicine, healthcare, and wellbeing everywhere. We conclude with the observation that CRI and its practitioners would make apt stewards of the new medical knowledge that their methods will bring forward.","Solomonides","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1701988","20200825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16301,""
"Contributions from the 2019 Literature on Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics","Summarize recent research and select the best papers published in 2019 in the field of Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics (BTI) for the corresponding section of the International Medical Informatics Association Yearbook. A literature review was performed for retrieving from PubMed papers indexed with keywords and free terms related to BTI. Independent review allowed the section editors to select a list of 15 candidate best papers which were subsequently peer-reviewed. A final consensus meeting gathering the whole Yearbook editorial committee was organized to finally decide on the selection of the best papers. Among the 931 retrieved papers covering the various subareas of BTI, the review process selected four best papers. The first paper presents a logical modeling of cancer pathways. Using their tools, the authors are able to identify two known behaviours of tumors. The second paper describes a deep-learning approach to predicting resistance to antibiotics in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The authors of the third paper introduce a Genomic Global Positioning System (GPS) enabling comparison of genomic data with other individuals or genomics databases while preserving privacy. The fourth paper presents a multi-omics and temporal sequence-based approach to provide a better understanding of the sequence of events leading to Alzheimer's Disease. Thanks to the normalization of open data and open science practices, research in BTI continues to develop and mature. Noteworthy achievements are sophisticated applications of leading edge machine-learning methods dedicated to personalized medicine.","SmaÃƒÂ¯l-Tabbone, Rance","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1702002","20200825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16302,""
"Ontologies, Knowledge Representation, and Machine Learning for Translational Research: Recent Contributions","To select, present, and summarize the most relevant papers published in 2018 and 2019 in the field of Ontologies and Knowledge Representation, with a particular focus on the intersection between Ontologies and Machine Learning. A comprehensive review of the medical informatics literature was performed to select the most interesting papers published in 2018 and 2019 and that document the utility of ontologies for computational analysis, including machine learning. Fifteen articles were selected for inclusion in this survey paper. The chosen articles belong to three major themes: (i) the identification of phenotypic abnormalities in electronic health record (EHR) data using the Human Phenotype Ontology ; (ii) word and node embedding algorithms to supplement natural language processing (NLP) of EHRs and other medical texts; and (iii) hybrid ontology and NLP-based approaches to extracting structured and unstructured components of EHRs. Unprecedented amounts of clinically relevant data are now available for clinical and research use. Machine learning is increasingly being applied to these data sources for predictive analytics, precision medicine, and differential diagnosis. Ontologies have become an essential component of software pipelines designed to extract, code, and analyze clinical information by machine learning algorithms. The intersection of machine learning and semantics is proving to be an innovative space in clinical research.","Robinson, Haendel","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1701991","20200825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16303,""
"Trends in Clinical Information Systems Research in 2019","To give an overview of recent research and to propose a selection of best papers published in 2019 in the field of Clinical Information Systems (CIS). Each year, we apply a systematic process to retrieve articles for the CIS section of the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics. For six years now, we use the same query to find relevant publications in the CIS field. Each year we retrieve more than 2,000 papers. As CIS section editors, we categorize the retrieved articles in a multi-pass review to distill a pre-selection of 15 candidate best papers. Then, Yearbook editors and external reviewers assess the selected candidate best papers. Based on the review results, the IMIA Yearbook Editorial Committee chooses the best papers during the selection meeting. We used text mining, and term co-occurrence mapping techniques to get an overview of the content of the retrieved articles. We carried out the query in mid-January 2020 and retrieved a de-duplicated result set of 2,407 articles from 1,023 different journals. This year, we nominated 14 papers as candidate best papers, and three of them were finally selected as best papers in the CIS section. As in previous years, the content analysis of the articles revealed the broad spectrum of topics covered by CIS research. We could observe ongoing trends, as seen in the last years. Patient benefit research is in the focus of many research activities, and trans-institutional aggregation of data remains a relevant field of work. Powerful machine-learning-based approaches, that use readily available data now often outperform human-based procedures. However, the ethical perspective of this development often comes too short in the considerations. We thus assume that ethical aspects will and should deliver much food for thought for future CIS research.","Hackl, Hoerbst","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1702018","20200825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16304,""
"Using machine learning for predicting cervical cancer from Swedish electronic health records by mining hierarchical representations","Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich documentation regarding disease symptoms and progression, but EHR data is challenging to use for diagnosis prediction due to its high dimensionality, relative scarcity, and substantial level of noise. We investigated how to best represent EHR data for predicting cervical cancer, a serious disease where early detection is beneficial for the outcome of treatment. A case group of 1321 patients with cervical cancer were matched to ten times as many controls, and for both groups several types of events were extracted from their EHRs. These events included clinical codes, lab results, and contents of free text notes retrieved using a LSTM neural network. Clinical events are described with great variation in EHR texts, leading to a very large feature space. Therefore, an event hierarchy inferred from the textual events was created to represent the clinical texts. Overall, the events extracted from free text notes contributed the most to the final prediction, and the hierarchy of textual events further improved performance. Four classifiers were evaluated for predicting a future cancer diagnosis where Random Forest achieved the best results with an AUC of 0.70 from a year before diagnosis up to 0.97 one day before diagnosis. We conclude that our approach is sound and had excellent discrimination at diagnosis, but only modest discrimination capacity before this point. Since our study objective was earlier disease prediction than such, we propose further work should consider extending patient histories through e.g. the integration of primary health records preceding referral to hospital.","Weegar, SundstrÃƒÂ¶m","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237911","20201029","Data Mining; Electronic Health Records; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Sweden; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16305,""
"Deep Learning for LiDAR Point Clouds in Autonomous Driving: A Review","Recently, the advancement of deep learning (DL) in discriminative feature learning from 3-D LiDAR data has led to rapid development in the field of autonomous driving. However, automated processing uneven, unstructured, noisy, and massive 3-D point clouds are a challenging and tedious task. In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing compelling DL architectures applied in LiDAR point clouds, detailing for specific tasks in autonomous driving, such as segmentation, detection, and classification. Although several published research articles focus on specific topics in computer vision for autonomous vehicles, to date, no general survey on DL applied in LiDAR point clouds for autonomous vehicles exists. Thus, the goal of this article is to narrow the gap in this topic. More than 140 key contributions in the recent five years are summarized in this survey, including the milestone 3-D deep architectures, the remarkable DL applications in 3-D semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification; specific data sets, evaluation metrics, and the state-of-the-art performance.

Systematic review. Level 2. Individual test characteristics (bear hug, belly press, lift-off, Napoleon, and internal rotation lag sign) were combined in series and in parallel to maximize clinical sensitivity and specificity for any special test evaluated in at least 2 studies. A secondary analysis utilized subjective pretest probabilities to create a clinical decision tree algorithm and provide posttest probabilities. A total of 3174 studies were identified, and 5 studies met inclusion criteria. The special test combination of the bear hug and belly press demonstrated the highest positive likelihood ratio (18.29). Overall, 3 special test combinations in series demonstrated a significant impact on posttest probabilities. With parallel testing, the combination of bear hug and belly press had the highest sensitivity (84%) and lowest calculated negative likelihood ratio (0.21). The combined application of the bear hug and belly press physical examination maneuvers is an optimal combination for evaluating subscapularis pathology. Positive findings using this test combination in series with a likely pretest probability yield a 96% posttest probability; whereas, negative findings tested in parallel with an unlikely pretest probability yield a 12% posttest probability.","Dakkak, Krill, Krill, Nwachukwu, McCormick","https://doi.org/10.1177/1941738120936232","20200821","diagnosis; physical examination; rotator cuff; shoulder examination; special tests; subscapularis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16307,""
"Automated glaucoma screening method based on image segmentation and feature extraction","Glaucoma is a chronic disease that threatens eye health and can cause permanent blindness. Since there is no cure for glaucoma, early screening and detection are crucial for the prevention of glaucoma. Therefore, a novel method for automatic glaucoma screening that combines clinical measurement features with image-based features is proposed in this paper. To accurately extract clinical measurement features, an improved UNet++ neural network is proposed to segment the optic disc and optic cup based on region of interest (ROI) simultaneously. Some important clinical measurement features, such as optic cup to disc ratio, are extracted from the segmentation results. Then, the increasing field of view (IFOV) feature model is proposed to fully extract texture features, statistical features, and other hidden image-based features. Next, we select the best feature combination from all the features and use the adaptive synthetic sampling approach to alleviate the uneven distribution of training data. Finally, a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) classifier for glaucoma screening is trained. Experimental results based on the ORIGA dataset show that the proposed algorithm achieves excellent glaucoma screening performance with sensitivity of 0.894, accuracy of 0.843, and AUC of 0.901, which is superior to other existing methods.Graphical abstract Framework of the proposed glaucoma classification method.","Guo, Li, Tang, Zou, Fan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11517-020-02237-2","20200916","Feature extraction; Glaucoma screening; Image segmentation; Neural network","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16308,""
"mHealth app using machine learning to increase physical activity in diabetes and depression: clinical trial protocol for the DIAMANTE Study","Depression and diabetes are highly disabling diseases with a high prevalence and high rate of comorbidity, particularly in low-income ethnic minority patients. Though comorbidity increases the risk of adverse outcomes and mortality, most clinical interventions target these diseases separately. Increasing physical activity might be effective to simultaneously lower depressive symptoms and improve glycaemic control. Self-management apps are a cost-effective, scalable and easy access treatment to increase physical activity. However, cutting-edge technological applications often do not reach vulnerable populations and are not tailored to an individual's behaviour and characteristics. Tailoring of interventions using machine learning methods likely increases the effectiveness of the intervention. In a three-arm randomised controlled trial, we will examine the effect of a text-messaging smartphone application to encourage physical activity in low-income ethnic minority patients with comorbid diabetes and depression. The adaptive intervention group receives messages chosen from different messaging banks by a reinforcement learning algorithm. The uniform random intervention group receives the same messages, but chosen from the messaging banks with equal probabilities. The control group receives a weekly mood message. We aim to recruit 276 adults from primary care clinics aged 18-75 years who have been diagnosed with current diabetes and show elevated depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale-8 (PHQ-8) &gt;5). We will compare passively collected daily step counts, self-report PHQ-8 and most recent haemoglobin A1c from medical records at baseline and at intervention completion at 6-month follow-up. The Institutional Review Board at the University of California San Francisco approved this study (IRB: 17-22608).

"A system for automatically extracting clinical events with temporal information","The popularization of health and medical informatics yields huge amounts of data. Extracting clinical events on a temporal course is the foundation of enabling advanced applications and research. It is a structure of presenting information in chronological order. Manual extraction would be extremely challenging due to the quantity and complexity of the records. We present an recurrent neural network- based architecture, which is able to automatically extract clinical event expressions along with each event's temporal information. The system is built upon the attention-based and recursive neural networks and introduce a piecewise representation (we divide the input sentences into three pieces to better utilize the information in the sentences), incorporates semantic information by utilizing word representations obtained from BioASQ and Wikipedia. The system is evaluated on the THYME corpus, a set of manually annotated clinical records from Mayo Clinic. In order to further verify the effectiveness of the system, the system is also evaluated on the TimeBank _Dense corpus. The experiments demonstrate that the system outperforms the current state-of-the-art models. The system also supports domain adaptation, i.e., the system may be used in brain cancer data while its model is trained in colon cancer data. Our system extracts temporal expressions, event expressions and link them according to actually occurring sequence, which may structure the key information from complicated unstructured clinical records. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining the piecewise representation method with attention mechanism can capture more complete features. The system is flexible and can be extended to handle other document types.","Li, Li, Long, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-01208-9","20200825","Attention mechanism; Clinical text mining; Event extraction; Piecewise representation; Relation extraction; Temporal extraction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16310,""
"Clinical trial search: Using biomedical language understanding models for re-ranking","Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have achieved state-of-the-art effectiveness in some of the biomedical information processing applications. We investigate the effectiveness of these techniques for clinical trial search systems. In precision medicine, matching patients to relevant experimental evidence or prospective treatments is a complex task which requires both clinical and biological knowledge. To assist in this complex decision making, we investigate the effectiveness of different ranking models based on the BERT models under the same retrieval platform to ensure fair comparisons. An evaluation on the TREC Precision Medicine benchmarks indicates that our approach using the BERT model pre-trained on scientific abstracts and clinical notes achieves state-of-the-art results, on par with highly specialised, manually optimised heuristic models. We also report the best results to date on the TREC Precision Medicine 2017 ad hoc retrieval task for clinical trial search.","Rybinski, Xu, Karimi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103530","20200925","Bidirectional transformer encoder; Clinical decision making; Complex search; Document search; Information retrieval; Learning-to-rank; Natural language processing; Precision medicine; Ranking functions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16311,""
"Health Economic and Safety Considerations for Artificial Intelligence Applications in Diabetic Retinopathy Screening","Systematic screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) has been widely recommended for early detection in patients with diabetes to address preventable vision loss. However, substantial manpower and financial resources are required to deploy opportunistic screening and transition to systematic DR screening programs. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies may improve access and reduce the financial burden for DR screening while maintaining comparable or enhanced clinical effectiveness. To deploy an AI-based DR screening program in a real-world setting, it is imperative that health economic assessment (HEA) and patient safety analyses are conducted to guide appropriate allocation of resources and design safe, reliable systems. Few studies published to date include these considerations when integrating AI-based solutions into DR screening programs. In this article, we provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art of AI technology (focusing on deep learning systems), followed by an appraisal of existing literature on the applications of AI in ophthalmology. We also discuss practical considerations that drive the development of a successful DR screening program, such as the implications of false-positive or false-negative results and image gradeability. Finally, we examine different plausible methods for HEA and safety analyses that can be used to assess concerns regarding AI-based screening.","Xie, Gunasekeran, Balaskas, Keane, Sim, Bachmann, Macrae, Ting","https://doi.org/10.1167/tvst.9.2.22","20200928","artificial intelligence; deep learning; diabetic retinopathy; machine learning; ocular imaging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16312,""
"Using de-identified electronic health records to research mental health supported housing services: A feasibility study","Mental health supported housing services are a key component in the rehabilitation of people with severe and complex needs. They are implemented widely in the UK and other deinstitutionalised countries but there have been few empirical studies of their effectiveness due to the logistic challenges and costs of standard research methods. The Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) tool, developed to de-identify and interrogate routinely recorded electronic health records, may provide an alternative to evaluate supported housing services. The feasibility of using the Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust CRIS database to identify a sample of users of mental health supported accommodation services. Two approaches to data interrogation and case identification were compared; using structured fields indicating individual's accommodation status, and iterative development of free text searches of clinical notes referencing supported housing. The data used were recorded over a 10-year-period (01-January-2008 to 31-December-2017). Both approaches were carried out by one full-time researcher over four weeks (150 hours). Two structured fields indicating accommodation status were found, 2,140 individuals had a value in at least one of the fields representative of supported accommodation. The free text search of clinical notes returned 21,103 records pertaining to 1,105 individuals. A manual review of 10% of the notes indicated an estimated 733 of these individuals had used a supported housing service, a positive predictive value of 66.4%. Over two-thirds of the individuals returned in the free text search (768/1,105, 69.5%) were identified via the structured fields approach. Although the estimated positive predictive value was relatively high, a substantial proportion of the individuals appearing only in the free text search (337/1,105, 30.5%) are likely to be false positives. It is feasible and requires minimal resources to use de-identified electronic health record search tools to identify large samples of users of mental health supported housing using structured and free text fields. Further work is needed to establish the availability and completion of variables relevant to specific clinical research questions in order to fully assess the utility of electronic health records in evaluating the effectiveness of these services.","Dalton-Locke, Thygesen, Werbeloff, Osborn, Killaspy","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237664","20201015","Adult; Databases, Factual; Electronic Health Records; England; Feasibility Studies; Female; Housing; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Middle Aged; Natural Language Processing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16313,""
"Technical workflows for hyperspectral plant image assessment and processing on the greenhouse and laboratory scale","The use of hyperspectral cameras is well established in the field of plant phenotyping, especially as a part of high-throughput routines in greenhouses. Nevertheless, the workflows used differ depending on the applied camera, the plants being imaged, the experience of the users, and the measurement set-up. This review describes a general workflow for the assessment and processing of hyperspectral plant data at greenhouse and laboratory scale. Aiming at a detailed description of possible error sources, a comprehensive literature review of possibilities to overcome these errors and influences is provided. The processing of hyperspectral data of plants starting from the hardware sensor calibration, the software processing steps to overcome sensor inaccuracies, and the preparation for machine learning is shown and described in detail. Furthermore, plant traits extracted from spectral hypercubes are categorized to standardize the terms used when describing hyperspectral traits in plant phenotyping. A scientific data perspective is introduced covering information for canopy, single organs, plant development, and also combined traits coming from spectral and 3D measuring devices. This publication provides a structured overview on implementing hyperspectral imaging into biological studies at greenhouse and laboratory scale. Workflows have been categorized to define a trait-level scale according to their metrological level and the processing complexity. A general workflow is shown to outline procedures and requirements to provide fully calibrated data of the highest quality. This is essential for differentiation of the smallest changes from hyperspectral reflectance of plants, to track and trace hyperspectral development as an answer to biotic or abiotic stresses.","Paulus, Mahlein","https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giaa090","20200825","camera calibration; hyperspectral; hyperspectral signature; machine learning; plant phenotyping","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16314,""
"A corpus-driven standardization framework for encoding clinical problems with HL7 FHIR","Free-text problem descriptions are brief explanations of patient diagnoses and issues, commonly found in problem lists and other prominent areas of the medical record. These compact representations often express complex and nuanced medical conditions, making their semantics challenging to fully capture and standardize. In this study, we describe a framework for transforming free-text problem descriptions into standardized Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) models. This approach leverages a combination of domain-specific dependency parsers, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) natural language models, and cui2vec Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concept vectors to align extracted concepts from free-text problem descriptions into structured FHIR models. A neural network classification model is used to classify thirteen relationship types between concepts, facilitating mapping to the FHIR Condition resource. We use data programming, a weak supervision approach, to eliminate the need for a manually annotated training corpus. Shapley values, a mechanism to quantify contribution, are used to interpret the impact of model features. We found that our methods identified the focus concept, or primary clinical concern of the problem description, with an F<sub>1</sub> score of 0.95. Relationships from the focus to other modifying concepts were extracted with an F<sub>1</sub> score of 0.90. When classifying relationships, our model achieved a 0.89 weighted average F<sub>1</sub> score, enabling accurate mapping of attributes into HL7 FHIR models. We also found that the BERT input representation predominantly contributed to the classifier decision as shown by the Shapley values analysis.","Peterson, Jiang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103541","20201020","Deep Learning (D000077321); Health Information Interoperability (D000073892); Natural Language Processing (D009323); Semantics (D012660); Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (D039061)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16315,""
"Effects of Foot Strike Techniques on Running Biomechanics: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Distance running is one of the most popular physical activities, and running-related injuries (RRIs) are also common. Foot strike patterns have been suggested to affect biomechanical variables related to RRI risks. To determine the effects of foot strike techniques on running biomechanics. The databases of Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and EBSCO were searched from database inception through November 2018. The initial electronic search found 723 studies. Of these, 26 studies with a total of 472 participants were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Level 4. Means, standard deviations, and sample sizes were extracted from the eligible studies, and the standard mean differences (SMDs) were obtained for biomechanical variables between forefoot strike (FFS) and rearfoot strike (RFS) groups using a random-effects model. FFS showed significantly smaller magnitude (SMD, -1.84; 95% CI, -2.29 to -1.38; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and loading rate (mean: SMD, -2.1; 95% CI, -3.18 to -1.01; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; peak: SMD, -1.77; 95% CI, -2.21 to -1.33; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) of impact force, ankle stiffness (SMD, -1.69; 95% CI, -2.46 to -0.92; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), knee extension moment (SMD, -0.64; 95% CI, -0.98 to -0.3; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), knee eccentric power (SMD, -2.03; 95% CI, -2.51 to -1.54; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), knee negative work (SMD, -1.56; 95% CI, -2.11 to -1.00; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and patellofemoral joint stress (peak: SMD, -0.71; 95% CI, -1.28 to -0.14; <i>P</i> = 0.01; integral: SMD, -0.63; 95% CI, -1.11 to -0.15; <i>P</i> = 0.01) compared with RFS.

Running with RFS imposed higher biomechanical loads on overall ground impact and knee and patellofemoral joints, whereas FFS imposed higher biomechanical loads on the ankle joint and Achilles tendon. The modification of strike techniques may affect the specific biomechanical loads experienced on relevant structures or tissues during running.","Xu, Yuan, Wang, Wang, Liu, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1177/1941738120934715","20200819","distance running; foot strike pattern; impact load; joint biomechanics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16316,""
"Natural Language Processing of Serum Protein Electrophoresis Reports in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System","Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) is a clinical tool used to screen for monoclonal gammopathy, thus it is a critical tool in the evaluation of patients with multiple myeloma. However, SPEP laboratory results are usually returned as short text reports, which are not amenable to simple computerized processing for large-scale studies. We applied natural language processing (NLP) to detect monoclonal gammopathy in SPEP laboratory results and compared its performance at multiple hospitals using both a rules-based manual system and a machine-learning algorithm. We used the data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, which comprises data from 20 million unique individuals. SPEP reports were collected from July to December 2015 at 5 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. Of these reports, we annotated the presence or absence of monoclonal gammopathy in 300 reports. We applied a machine learning-based NLP and a manual rules-based NLP to detect monoclonal gammopathy in SPEP reports at each of the hospitals, then applied the model from 1 hospital to each of the other hospitals. The learning system achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.997, and the rules-based system achieved an accuracy of 0.99. When a model trained on 1 hospital's data was applied to a different hospital, however, accuracy varied greatly, and the learning-based models performed better than the rules-based model. Binary classification of short clinical texts such as SPEP reports may be a particularly attractive target on which to train highly accurate NLP systems.","Ryu, Zimolzak","https://doi.org/10.1200/CCI.19.00167","20200924","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16317,""
"Effects of reading media on reading comprehension in health professional education: a systematic review protocol","To evaluate the effect of digital-based reading versus paper-based reading on reading comprehension among students, trainees, and residents participating in health professional education. Several reviews have examined the effects of reading media on reading comprehension; however, none have considered health professional education specifically. The growing use of electronic media in health professional education, as well as recent data on the consequences of digital-based reading on learning, justify the necessity to review the current literature to provide research and educational recommendations. Studies conducted with health professions students, trainees, and residents individually receiving educational material written in their first language in a paper-based or a digital-based format will be considered. Studies conducted among participants with cognitive impairment or reading difficulties will be excluded. Observational, experimental and quasi-experimental studies that assess reading comprehension measured by previously validated or researcher-generated tests will be considered. Relevant studies will be sought from CINAHL, Embase, ERIC, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science (SCI and SSCI), without date or language restrictions. Two independent reviewers will perform title and abstract screening, full-text review, critical appraisal, and data extraction. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion or with a third independent reviewer.

"Sentiment analysis of social media posts on pharmacotherapy: A scoping review","Social media is playing an increasingly central role in patient's decision-making process. Advances in technology have enabled meaningful interpretation of discussions on social media. We conducted a scoping review to assess whether Sentiment Analysis (SA), a big data analytic tool, could be used to extract meaningful themes from social media discussions on pharmacotherapy. A keyword search strategy was used on the following databases: OneSearch, PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane. One hundred and ninety-four titles were identified of which 10 studies were included. We extracted themes about uses and implications of SA of social media discussions on pharmacotherapy. Twitter was the most frequently analyzed platform. Assessment of public sentiment about a particular medication was the most common use of SA followed by detection of adverse drug reactions. Studies also revealed a significant impact of news media on public sentiment. Implications for real world practice include identifying reasons for a negative sentiment, detecting adverse drug reactions and using the impact of news media on social media sentiment to drive public health initiatives. The lack of a consistent approach to SA between the studies reflects the lack of a gold standard for the technology and consequently the need for future research. Sentiment Analysis is a promising technology that can allow us to better understand patient opinion regarding pharmacotherapy. This knowledge can be used to improve patient safety, patient- physician interaction, and also enhance the delivery of public health measures.","Sharma, Whittle, Haghighi, Burstein, Keen","https://doi.org/10.1002/prp2.640","20200924","data mining; pharmacotherapy; sentiment analysis; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16319,""
"Automated Detection of Interictal Epileptiform Discharges from Scalp Electroencephalograms by Convolutional Neural Networks","Visual evaluation of electroencephalogram (EEG) for Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs) as distinctive biomarkers of epilepsy has various limitations, including time-consuming reviews, steep learning curves, interobserver variability, and the need for specialized experts. The development of an automated IED detector is necessary to provide a faster and reliable diagnosis of epilepsy. In this paper, we propose an automated IED detector based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We have evaluated the proposed IED detector on a sizable database of 554 scalp EEG recordings (84 epileptic patients and 461 nonepileptic subjects) recorded at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Boston. The proposed CNN IED detector has achieved superior performance in comparison with conventional methods with a mean cross-validation area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.838[Formula: see text]Ã‚Â±[Formula: see text]0.040 and false detection rate of 0.2[Formula: see text]Ã‚Â±[Formula: see text]0.11 per minute for a sensitivity of 80%. We demonstrated the proposed system to be noninferior to 30 neurologists on a dataset from the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Further, we clinically validated the system at National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore, with an agreement accuracy of 81.41% with a clinical expert. Moreover, the proposed system can be applied to EEG recordings with any arbitrary number of channels.","Thomas, Jin, Thangavel, Bagheri, Yuvaraj, Dauwels, Rathakrishnan, Halford, Cash, Westover","https://doi.org/10.1142/S0129065720500306","20201030","Epilepsy; clinical validation; convolutional neural networks; deep learning; electroencephalogram; interictal epileptiform discharges; multi-center study; spike detection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16320,""
"A systematic review of fuzzing based on machine learning techniques","Security vulnerabilities play a vital role in network security system. Fuzzing technology is widely used as a vulnerability discovery technology to reduce damage in advance. However, traditional fuzz testing faces many challenges, such as how to mutate input seed files, how to increase code coverage, and how to bypass the format verification effectively. Therefore machine learning techniques have been introduced as a new method into fuzz testing to alleviate these challenges. This paper reviews the research progress of using machine learning techniques for fuzz testing in recent years, analyzes how machine learning improves the fuzzing process and results, and sheds light on future work in fuzzing. Firstly, this paper discusses the reasons why machine learning techniques can be used for fuzzing scenarios and identifies five different stages in which machine learning has been used. Then this paper systematically studies machine learning-based fuzzing models from five dimensions of selection of machine learning algorithms, pre-processing methods, datasets, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameters setting. Secondly, this paper assesses the performance of the machine learning techniques in existing research for fuzz testing. The results of the evaluation prove that machine learning techniques have an acceptable capability of prediction for fuzzing. Finally, the capability of discovering vulnerabilities both traditional fuzzers and machine learning-based fuzzers is analyzed. The results depict that the introduction of machine learning techniques can improve the performance of fuzzing. We hope to provide researchers with a systematic and more in-depth understanding of fuzzing based on machine learning techniques and provide some references for this field through analysis and summarization of multiple dimensions.","Wang, Jia, Liu, Huang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237749","20201020","Computer Security; Machine Learning; Software Validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16321,""
"Effect of monoclonal antibody drug therapy on mucosal biomarkers in airway disease: A systematic review","Monoclonal antibody therapies have a growing role in treating refractory airway disease. The review aimed to summarize the response of respiratory mucosa to monoclonal antibody treatments in inflammatory airway conditions. We conducted a systematic review including risk of bias assessment. MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed from 1 January 2000 to 16 November 2019 were searched. Eligible studies assessed the immunological and histological response of airway mucosa to monoclonal antibody therapy compared with baseline or a comparison group in patients with respiratory diseases (asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis and allergic rhinitis). Any prospective interventional studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and single-arm trials, were eligible. There were 4195 articles screened, and full-text analysis produced nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 11 studies with extractable data. Nine were RCTs, and two were single-arm trials. These studies focused on asthma (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 9 articles), chronic rhinosinusitis (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1) and allergic rhinitis (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1). Five monoclonal antibody drugs were assessed (omalizumab, mepolizumab, dupilumab, benralizumab and tralokinumab). Risk of bias was low (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6) or unclear (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3) in the RCTs and moderate in the single-arm trials. Omalizumab reduced the mucosal concentration of its target, IgE. Dupilumab reduced the concentration of one of its targets, IL-13, but not IL-4. Omalizumab, mepolizumab and benralizumab reduced tissue eosinophil cell density. Dupilumab decreased mucosal eosinophil granule proteins. Tralokinumab did not affect airway mucosa. Knowledge of the expected biological response of monoclonal antibody therapy on biomarkers in disease tissue provides an important supplement to data about clinical outcomes. An understanding of the biological effect is essential to identify likely responders, reasons for treatment failure and necessary adjustments to monoclonal antibody treatment. Further investigation into the effect of monoclonal antibody therapy on disease mucosa and more precise endotyping are required to move closer to achieving personalized medicine.","Walter, Ho, Alvarado, Rimmer, Campbell, Kalish, Sacks, Harvey","https://doi.org/10.1111/cea.13721","20201101","ENT; asthma; biomarker; monoclonal antibody; mucosa; rhinitis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16322,""
"Toward automatic evaluation of medical abstracts: The current value of sentiment analysis and machine learning for classification of the importance of PubMed abstracts of randomized trials for stroke","Text mining with automatic extraction of key features is gaining increasing importance in science and particularly medicine due to the rapidly increasing number of publications. Here we evaluate the current potential of sentiment analysis and machine learning to extract the importance of the reported results and conclusions of randomized trials on stroke. PubMed abstracts of 200 recent reports of randomized trials were reviewed and manually classified according to the estimated importance of the studies. Importance of the papers was classified as &quot;game changer&quot;, &quot;suggestive&quot;, &quot;maybe&quot; &quot;negative result&quot;. Algorithmic sentiment analysis was subsequently used on both the &quot;Results&quot; and the &quot;Conclusions&quot; paragraphs, resulting in a numerical output for polarity and subjectivity. The result of the human assessment was then compared to polarity and subjectivity. In addition, a neural network using the Keras platform built on Tensorflow and Python was trained to map the &quot;Results&quot; and &quot;Conclusions&quot; to the dichotomized human assessment (1: &quot;game changer&quot; or &quot;suggestive&quot;; 0:&quot;maybe&quot; or &quot;negative&quot;, or no results reported). 120 abstracts were used as the training set and 80 as the test set. 9 out of the 200 reports were classified manually as &quot;game changer&quot;, 40 as &quot;suggestive&quot;, 73 as &quot;maybe&quot; and 32 and &quot;negative&quot;; 46 abstracts did not contain any results. Polarity was generally higher for the &quot;Conclusions&quot; than for the &quot;Results&quot;. Polarity was highest for the &quot;Conclusions&quot; classified as &quot;suggestive&quot;. Subjectivity was also higher in the classes &quot;suggestive&quot; and &quot;maybe&quot; than in the classes &quot;game changer&quot; and &quot;negative&quot;. The trained neural network provided a correct dichotomized output with an accuracy of 71% based on the &quot;Results&quot; and 73% based on &quot;Conclusions&quot; . Current statistical approaches to text analysis can grasp the impact of scientific medical abstracts to a certain degree.

"M2 segment thrombectomy is not associated with increased complication risk compared to M1 segment: A meta-analysis of recent literature","Recent clinical comparisons of M1 and M2 segment endovascular thrombectomy have reached incongruous results in rates of complication and functional outcomes. This study aims to clarify the controversy surrounding this rapidly advancing technique through literature review and meta-analysis. A Pubmed search was performed (January 2015-September 2019) using the following keywords: &quot;M2 AND (&quot;stroke&quot; OR &quot;occlusion&quot;) AND (&quot;thrombectomy&quot; OR &quot;endovascular&quot;)&quot;. Safety and clinical outcomes were compared between segments via weighted Student's t-test, Chi-square and odds ratio while study heterogeneity was analyzed using Cochran Q and I<sup>2</sup> tests. Pubmed identified 208 articles and eleven studies were included after full-text analysis, comprising 2,548 M1 and 758 M2 mechanical thrombectomy segment cases. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were comparatively lower in patients experiencing an M2 occlusion (16Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 1.25 vs 13.6Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 0.96, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01). Patients who underwent M2 mechanical thrombectomy were more likely to experience both good clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) (48.6% vs 43.5% respectively, OR 1.24; CI 1.05-1.47, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.01) and excellent clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 0-1) (34.7% vs. 26.5%%, OR 1.6; CI 1.28-1.99, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01) at 90 days compared to M1 mechanical thrombectomy. Neither recanalization rates (75.3% vs 72.8%, OR 0.92, CI 0.75-1.13, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.44) nor symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates (5.6% vs 4.9%, OR 0.92; CI 0.61-1.39, p=Ã‚Â 0.7) were significantly different between M1 and M2 cohorts. Mortality was less frequent in the M2 cohort compared to M1 (16.3% vs 20.7%, OR 0.73; CI 0.57-0.94, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.01). M1 and M2 cohorts did not differ in symptom onset-to-puncture (238.1Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 46.7 vs 239.8Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 43.9Ã‚Â min respectively, p=0.488) nor symptom onset-to recanalization times (318.7Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 46.6 vs 317.7Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 71.1Ã‚Â min respectively, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.772), though mean operative duration was shorter in the M2 cohort (61.8Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 25.5 vs 54.6Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 24Ã‚Â min, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01). Patients who underwent M2 mechanical thrombectomy had a higher prevalence of good and excellent clinical outcomes compared to the M1 mechanical thrombectomy cohorts. Additionally, our data suggest lower mortality rates in the M2 cohort and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates that are similar to the M1 cohort.

Besides the identification of new molecular prognostic and predictive biomarkers and the development of new targeted and immunotherapeutic drugs, imaging has started to play a central role in this new era. Terms such as &quot;radiomics&quot;, &quot;radiogenomics&quot; or &quot;radiÃ¢â‚¬Â¦-omics&quot; are becoming increasingly common in the literature and soon they will represent an integral part of clinical practice. The use of artificial intelligence, imaging and &quot;-omics&quot; data can be used to develop models able to predict, for example, the features of the tumor immune microenvironment through imaging, and to monitor the therapeutic response beyond the standard radiological criteria. The aims of this narrative review are to provide a simplified guide for clinicians to these concepts, and to summarize the existing evidence on radiomics and &quot;radiÃ¢â‚¬Â¦-omics&quot; in cancer immunotherapy.","Porcu, Solinas, Mannelli, Micheletti, Lambertini, Willard-Gallo, Neri, Flanders, Saba","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.critrevonc.2020.103068","20200928","CTLA-4; PD-1/PD-L1; Radiomics; cancer immunotherapy; immune checkpoint blockade; immune checkpoint molecules; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Immunotherapy; Neoplasms; Precision Medicine; Tumor Microenvironment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16325,""
"Artificial intelligence can increase the detection rate of colorectal polyps and adenomas: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Colonoscopy is an important method to diagnose polyps, especially adenomatous polyps. However, the rate of missed diagnoses is relatively high. In this study, we aimed to determine whether artificial intelligence (AI) improves the polyp detection rate (PDR) and adenoma detection rate (ADR) with colonoscopy. We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases; the search included entries in the databases up to and including 29 February 2020. Five articles that involved a total of 4311 patients fulfilled the selection criteria. The results of these studies showed that both PDR and ADR increased with the assistance of AI compared with those in control groups {pooled odds ratio (OR) = 1.91 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.68-2.16] and 1.75 (95% CI 1.52-2.01), respectively}. Good bowel preparation reduced the impact of AI, but significant differences were still apparent in PDR and ADR [pooled OR = 1.69 (95% CI 1.32-2.16) and 1.36 (95% CI 1.04-1.78), respectively]. The characteristics of polyps and adenomas also influenced the results. The average number of polyps and adenomas detected varied significantly by location, and small polyps and adenomas were more likely to be missed. However, the effect of the morphology of polyps and AI-assisted detection needs further studies. In conclusion, AI increases the detection rates of polyps and adenomas in colonoscopy. Without AI assistance, detection rates can be improved with better bowel preparation and training for small polyp and adenoma detection.","Li, Lu, Yan, Tan, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1097/MEG.0000000000001906","20200817","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16326,""
"Semixup: In-and Out-of-Manifold Regularization for Deep Semi-Supervised Knee Osteoarthritis Severity Grading from Plain Radiographs","Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the highest disability factors in the world. This musculoskeletal disorder is assessed from clinical symptoms, and typically confirmed via radiographic assessment. This visual assessment done by a radiologist requires experience, and suffers from moderate to high inter-observer variability. The recent literature has shown that deep learning methods can reliably perform the OA severity assessment according to the gold standard Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system. However, these methods require large amounts of labeled data, which are costly to obtain. In this study, we propose the Semixup algorithm, a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach to leverage unlabeled data. Semixup relies on consistency regularization using in- and out-of-manifold samples, together with interpolated consistency. On an independent test set, our method significantly outperformed other state-of-the-art SSL methods in most cases. Finally, when compared to a well-tuned fully supervised baseline that yielded a balanced accuracy (BA) of 70.9 Ã‚Â± 0.8% on the test set, Semixup had comparable performance - BA of 71Ã‚Â± 0.8% (p = 0.368) while requiring 6 times less labeled data. These results show that our proposed SSL method allows building fully automatic OA severity assessment tools with datasets that are available outside research settings.","Nguyen, Saarakkala, Blaschko, Tiulpin","https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2020.3017007","20200821","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16327,""
"Bibliometric analysis of researches on traditional Chinese medicine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a worldwide pandemic, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has played an important role in response. We aimed to analyze the published literature on TCM for COVID-19, and provide reference for later research. This study searched the CBM, CNKI, PubMed, and EMBASE from its establishment to March 11, 2020. VOSviewer 1.6.11 and gCLUTO 2.0 software were used to visually analyze the included studies. A total of 309 studies were included, including 61 journals, 1441 authors, 277 institutions, and 27 provinces. Research collaborations among regions were among those close in geographical distance. The collaborations of institutions and authors were more likely to be restricted to the same region. Among the authors with frequency greater than two (65 authors), only 19 authors had connection with others. More than 70% (358/491) of keywords were only presented once, and 20 keywords were shown more than 10 times. Five research topics were identified: Data mining method based analysis on the medication law of Chinese medicine in prevention and management of COVID-19; exploration of active compounds of Chinese medicine for COVID-19 treatment based on network pharmacology and molecular docking; expert consensus and interpretation of COVID-19 treatment; research on the etiology and pathogenesis of COVID-19; and clinical research of TCM for COVID-19 treatment. The research hotspots were scattered, and the collaboration between authors and institutions needed to be further strengthened.

"A systematic review of the complications of high-risk third molar removal and coronectomy: development of a decision tree model and preliminary health economic analysis to assist in treatment planning","Coronectomy is an alternative surgical technique for the management of high-risk third molars. It involves the removal of the crown of a tooth and the deliberate retention of the roots, thereby avoiding injury to the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN). Previous studies have suggested that it reduces the risk of nerve injury when compared with surgical extraction. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the incidence of complications following coronectomy such as IAN injury, pain, dry socket, infection, root migration, and need for re-operation. A comparative cost analysis of coronectomy and surgical extraction was done based on the results of the review. This provides an insight into the economic implications of the two procedures. A search through the MEDLINE database via Ovid, PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE via Ovid, and Web of Science, was carried out to extract randomised and non-randomised controlled trials. Four studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis was conducted to measure the overall effect of each outcome. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for IAN injury was 0.16 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.39). Coronectomy reduced this risk by 84%. Dry socket may occur less frequently following coronectomy whereas infection did not show a higher incidence with either intervention. Root migration was found to occur in 13%-85% of cases and the average incidence of re-operation was 2.2%. The ratio of the average costs was 1.12 favouring coronectomy if cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was not done prior to the procedure. If a scan was taken routinely for coronectomy, the cost ratio marginally favoured extraction. Coronectomy reduced the risk of nerve injury in high-risk third molars. Definitive conclusions, however, cannot be made for outcomes such as the need for re-operation, which may alter the cost ratio of coronectomy:extraction, as higher quality studies with longer follow-up are needed.","Pitros, O'Connor, Tryfonos, Lopes","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.07.015","20200817","Coronectomy; Cost-benefit analysis; Inferior alveolar nerve injury; Surgical extraction; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16329,""
"Resting-state functional connectivity in early postanaesthesia recovery is characterised by globally reduced anticorrelations","A growing body of literature addresses the possible long-term cognitive effects of anaesthetics, but no study has delineated the normal trajectory of neural recovery attributable to anaesthesia alone in adults. We obtained resting-state functional MRI scans on 72 healthy human volunteers between ages 40 and 80 (median: 59) yr before, during, and after general anaesthesia with sevoflurane, in the absence of surgery, as part of a larger study on cognitive function postanaesthesia. Region-of-interest analysis, independent component analysis, and seed-to-voxel analysis were used to characterise resting-state functional connectivity and to differentiate between correlated and anticorrelated connectivity before, during, and after general anaesthesia. Whilst positively correlated functional connectivity remained essentially unchanged across these perianaesthetic states, anticorrelated functional connectivity decreased globally by 35% 1 h after emergence from general anaesthesia compared with baseline, as seen by the region-of-interest analysis. This decrease corresponded to a consistent reduction in expression of canonical resting-state networks, as seen by independent component analysis. All measures returned to baseline 1 day later. The normal perianaesthesia trajectory of resting-state connectivity in healthy adults is characterised by a transient global reduction in anticorrelated activity shortly after emergence from anaesthesia that returns to baseline by the following day.

"Distribution of Haemaphysalis longicornis and associated pathogens: analysis of pooled data from a China field survey and global published data","Haemaphysalis longicornis, a vector of various pathogens with medical and veterinary importance, is native to eastern Asia, and recently reached the USA as an emerging disease threat. In this study, we aimed to identify the geographical distribution, hosts, and associated pathogens of H longicornis. Data were collected from multiple sources, including a field survey, reference book, literature review, and related websites. The thematic maps showing geographical distribution of H longicornis and associated pathogens were produced by ArcGIS. Hosts of H longicornis and positive rates for H longicornis-associated pathogens were estimated by meta-analysis. Ecological niche modelling was used to predict potential global distribution of H longicornis. H longicornis was found to be present in ten countries, predominantly in eastern Asia, the USA, Australia, and New Zealand. The tick was known to feed on a variety of domestic and wild animals, and humans. At least 30 human pathogens were associated with H longicornis, including seven species of spotted fever group rickettsiae, seven species in the family of Anaplasmataceae, four genospecies in the complex Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, two Babesia species, six species of virus, and Francisella, Bartonella, Coxiella, and Toxoplasma, which were mainly reported in eastern Asia. The predictive modelling revealed that H longicornis might affect more extensive regions, including Europe, South America, and Africa, where the tick has never been recorded before. H longicornis is relatively common in the world, and is associated with various human and animal pathogens. Authorities and health-care workers should be aware of the threat of the tick species to public health and veterinary medicine. Surveillance and further investigations should be enhanced globally.

"A Systematic Review of the Evolution of Health-Economic Evaluation Models of Osteoarthritis","To comprehensively synthesise the evolution of health-economic evaluation models (HEEMs) of all OA interventions including preventions, core treatments, adjunct non-pharmacological interventions, pharmacological and surgical treatments. The literature was searched within health-economic/biomedical databases. Data extracted included: OA type, population characteristics, model setting/type/events, study perspective, comparators; and the reporting quality of the studies was assessed. The review protocol was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration: CRD42018092937). Eighty-eight studies were included. Pharmacological and surgical interventions were the focus in 51% and 44% studies, respectively. Twenty-four studies adopted a societal perspective (with increasing popularity after 2013), however most (63%) did not include indirect costs. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was the most popular outcome measure since 2008. Markov models were used by 62% of studies, with increasing popularity since 2008. Until 2010, most studies used short-to-medium time horizons; subsequently a lifetime horizon became popular. Eighty-six percent of studies reported discount rate(s) (predominantly between 3% and 5%). Studies published after 2002 had a better coverage of OA-related adverse events (AEs). Reporting quality significantly improved after 2001. OA HEEMs have evolved and improved substantially over time, with focus shifting from short-to-medium-term pharmacological decision-tree models to surgical-focused lifetime Markov models. Indirect costs of OA are frequently not considered, despite using a societal perspective. There was lack of reporting sensitivity of model outcome to input parameters including discount rate, OA definition, and population parameters. Whilst the coverage of OA-related AEs has improved over time, it is still not comprehensive.","Zhao, Ahmad, de Graaff, Xia, Winzenberg, Aitken, Palmer","https://doi.org/10.1002/acr.24410","20200817","Decision-tree Models; Health-economic evaluation; Markov Models; Osteoarthritis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16332,""
"Thyroid Ultrasound Reports: Will TI-RADS Improve Natural Language Processing Capture of Critical Thyroid Nodule Features?","Critical thyroid nodule features are contained in unstructured ultrasound (US) reports. The Thyroid Imaging, Reporting, and Data System (TI-RADS) uses five key features to risk stratify nodules and recommend appropriate intervention. This study aims to analyze the quality of US reporting and the potential benefit of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems in efficiently capturing TI-RADS features from text reports. This retrospective study used free-text thyroid US reports from an academic center (A) and community hospital (B). Physicians created &quot;gold standard&quot; annotations by manually extracting TI-RADS features and clinical recommendations from reports to determine how often they were included. Similar annotations were created using an automated NLP system and compared with the gold standard. Two hundred eighty-two reports contained 409 nodules at least 1-cm in maximum diameter. The gold standard identified three nodules (0.7%) which contained enough information to calculate a complete TI-RADS score. Shape was described most often (92.7% of nodules), whereas margins were described least often (11%). A median number of two TI-RADS features are reported per nodule. The NLP system was significantly less accurate than the gold standard in capturing echogenicity (27.5%) and margins (58.9%). One hundred eight nodule reports (26.4%) included clinical management recommendations, which were included more often at site A than B (33.9 versus 17%, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). These results suggest a gap between current US reporting styles and those needed to implement TI-RADS and achieve NLP accuracy. Synoptic reporting should prompt more complete thyroid US reporting, improved recommendations for intervention, and better NLP performance.","Chen, Dedhia, Imbus, Schneider","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2020.07.015","20200826","Natural language processing; TI-RADS; Thyroid; Ultrasound","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16333,""
"Cochrane Centralised Search Service showed high sensitivity identifying randomized controlled trials: A retrospective analysis","The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) is compiled from a number of sources, including PubMed and Embase. Since 2017, we have increased the number of sources feeding into CENTRAL and improved the efficiency of our processes through the use of application programming interfaces, machine learning, and crowdsourcing.Our objectives were twofold: (1) Assess the effectiveness of Cochrane's centralized search and screening processes to correctly identify references to published reports which are eligible for inclusion in Cochrane systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). (2) Identify opportunities to improve the performance of Cochrane's centralized search and screening processes to identify references to eligible trials. We identified all references to RCTs (either published journal articles or trial registration records) with a publication or registration date between 1st January 2017 and 31st December 2018 that had been included in a Cochrane intervention review. We then viewed an audit trail for each included reference to determine if it had been identified by our centralized search process and subsequently added to CENTRAL. We identified 650 references to included studies with a publication year of 2017 or 2018. Of those, 634 (97.5%) had been captured by Cochrane's Centralised Search Service. Sixteen references had been missed by the Cochrane's Centralised Search Service: six had PubMed-not-MEDLINE status, four were missed by the centralized Embase search, three had been misclassified by Cochrane Crowd, one was from a journal not indexed in MEDLINE or Embase, one had only been added to Embase in 2019, and one reference had been rejected by the automated RCT machine learning classifier. Of the sixteen missed references, eight were the main or only publication to the trial in the review in which it had been included. This analysis has shown that Cochrane's centralized search and screening processes are highly sensitive. It has also helped us to understand better why some references to eligible RCTs have been missed. The CSS is playing a critical role in helping to populate CENTRAL and is moving us toward making CENTRAL a comprehensive repository of RCTs.","Noel-Storr, Dooley, Wisniewski, Glanville, Thomas, Cox, Featherstone, Foxlee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.08.008","20200930","Cochrane central register of controlled trials; Crowdsourcing; Evidence synthesis; Information retrieval; Machine learning; Methodological filter; Randomized controlled trial; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16334,""

"Patient-centered Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Based on Specific Clinical Scenarios: Systematic Review, Meta-analysis and Trial Sequential Analysis","New antihyperglycemic medications have been proven to have cardiovascular (CV) and renal benefits in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, an evidence-based decision tree in specific clinical scenarios is lacking. Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with trial sequential analysis (TSA). Randomized controlled trial inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM from 1 of these subgroups: elderly, obese, previous atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD), previous coronary heart disease (CHD), previous heart failure (HF), or previous chronic kidney disease (CKD). Randomized controlled trials describing those subgroups with at least 48 weeks of follow-up were included. Outcomes: 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), CV death, hospitalization due to HF, and renal outcomes. We performed direct meta-analysis with the number of events in the intervention and control groups in each subset, and the relative risk of the events was calculated. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) were the only antihyperglycemic agents related to a reduction in CV events in different populations. For obese and elderly populations, GLP-1 RA were associated with benefits in 3-point MACE; for patients with ASCVD, both SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA had benefits in 3-point MACE, while for patients with CHD, only SGLT2i were beneficial. SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA reduced CV events in selected populations: SGLT2i led to a reduction in events in patients with previous CHD, ASCVD, and HF. GLP-1 RA led to a reduction in CV events in patients with ASCVD, elderly patients, and patients with obesity. Trial sequential analysis shows that these findings are conclusive.

Therefore, the objective of this work was to determine (a) the efficacy of aerobic training to improve CRF; (b) the role of aerobic training intensity (moderate or vigorous) on CRF response; (c) the effect of the aerobic training mode (continuous or interval) on changes in CRF in women with breast cancer (BC) receiving chemotherapy. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted as per PRISMA guidelines, and randomized controlled trials comparing usual care (UC) and aerobic training in women with BC undergoing chemotherapy were eligible. The results suggest that increases in CRF are favored by (a) aerobic training when compared to usual care; (b) vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise (64-90% of maximal oxygen uptake, VO<sub>2max</sub>) when compared to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (46-63% of VO<sub>2max</sub>); and (c) both continuous and interval aerobic training are effective at increasing the VO<sub>2max</sub>.

"Systematic Review of Digital Phenotyping and Machine Learning in Psychosis Spectrum Illnesses","Digital phenotyping is the use of data from smartphones and wearables collected in situ for capturing a digital expression of human behaviors. Digital phenotyping techniques can be used to analyze both passively (e.g., sensor) and actively (e.g., survey) collected data. Machine learning offers a possible predictive bridge between digital phenotyping and future clinical state. This review examines passive digital phenotyping across the schizophrenia spectrum and bipolar disorders, with a focus on machine-learning studies. A systematic review of passive digital phenotyping literature was conducted using keywords related to severe mental illnesses, data-collection devices (e.g., smartphones, wearables, actigraphy devices), and streams of data collected. Searches of five databases initially yielded 3312 unique publications. Fifty-one studies were selected for inclusion, with 16 using machine-learning techniques. All studies differed in features used, data pre-processing, analytical techniques, algorithms tested, and performance metrics reported. Across all studies, the data streams and other study factors reported also varied widely. Machine-learning studies focused on random forest, support vector, and neural net approaches, and almost exclusively on bipolar disorder. Many machine-learning techniques have been applied to passively collected digital phenotyping data in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Larger studies, and with improved data quality, are needed, as is further research on the application of machine learning to passive digital phenotyping data in early diagnosis and treatment of psychosis. In order to achieve greater comparability of studies, common data elements are identified for inclusion in future studies.","Benoit, Onyeaka, Keshavan, Torous","https://doi.org/10.1097/HRP.0000000000000268","20200915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16338,""
"Social, Behavioral, and Cultural factors of HIV in Malawi: Semi-Automated Systematic Review","Demographic and sociobehavioral factors are strong drivers of HIV infection rates in sub-Saharan Africa. These factors are often studied in qualitative research but ignored in quantitative analyses. However, they provide in-depth insight into the local behavior and may help to improve HIV prevention. To obtain a comprehensive overview of the sociobehavioral factors influencing HIV prevalence and incidence in Malawi, we systematically reviewed the literature using a newly programmed tool for automatizing part of the systematic review process. Due to the choice of broad search terms (&quot;HIV AND Malawi&quot;), our preliminary search revealed many thousands of articles. We, therefore, developed a Python tool to automatically extract, process, and categorize open-access articles published from January 1, 1987 to October 1, 2019 in the PubMed, PubMed Central, JSTOR, Paperity, and arXiV databases. We then used a topic modelling algorithm to classify and identify publications of interest. Our tool extracted 22,709 unique articles; 16,942 could be further processed. After topic modelling, 519 of these were clustered into relevant topics, of which 20 were kept after manual screening. We retrieved 7 more publications after examining the references so that 27 publications were finally included in the review. Reducing the 16,942 articles to 519 potentially relevant articles using the software took 5 days. Several factors contributing to the risk of HIV infection were identified, including religion, gender and relationship dynamics, beliefs, and sociobehavioral attitudes. Our software does not replace traditional systematic reviews, but it returns useful results to broad queries of open-access literature in under a week, without a priori knowledge. This produces a &quot;seed dataset&quot; of relevance that could be further developed. It identified known factors and factors that may be specific to Malawi. In the future, we aim to expand the tool by adding more social science databases and applying it to other sub-Saharan African countries.","Thiabaud, Triulzi, Orel, Tal, Keiser","https://doi.org/10.2196/18747","20200904","HIV/AIDS; Malawi; machine learning; risk factors; text mining; topic modelling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16339,""
"Text Processing for Detection of Fungal Ocular Involvement in Critical Care Patients: Cross-Sectional Study","Fungal ocular involvement can develop in patients with fungal bloodstream infections and can be vision-threatening. Ocular involvement has become less common in the current era of improved antifungal therapies. Retrospectively determining the prevalence of fungal ocular involvement is important for informing clinical guidelines, such as the need for routine ophthalmologic consultations. However, manual retrospective record review to detect cases is time-consuming. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of fungal ocular involvement in a critical care database using both structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data. We queried microbiology data from 46,467 critical care patients over 12 years (2000-2012) from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) to identify 265 patients with culture-proven fungemia. For each fungemic patient, demographic data, fungal species present in blood culture, and risk factors for fungemia (eg, presence of indwelling catheters, recent major surgery, diabetes, immunosuppressed status) were ascertained. All structured diagnosis codes and free-text narrative notes associated with each patient's hospitalization were also extracted. Screening for fungal endophthalmitis was performed using two approaches: (1) by querying a wide array of eye- and vision-related diagnosis codes, and (2) by utilizing a custom regular expression pipeline to identify and collate relevant text matches pertaining to fungal ocular involvement. Both approaches were validated using manual record review. The main outcome measure was the documentation of any fungal ocular involvement. In total, 265 patients had culture-proven fungemia, with Candida albicans (n=114, 43%) and Candida glabrata (n=74, 28%) being the most common fungal species in blood culture. The in-hospital mortality rate was 121 (46%). In total, 7 patients were identified as having eye- or vision-related diagnosis codes, none of whom had fungal endophthalmitis based on record review. There were 26,830 free-text narrative notes associated with these 265 patients. A regular expression pipeline based on relevant terms yielded possible matches in 683 notes from 108 patients. Subsequent manual record review again demonstrated that no patients had fungal ocular involvement. Therefore, the prevalence of fungal ocular involvement in this cohort was 0%. MIMIC-III contained no cases of ocular involvement among fungemic patients, consistent with prior studies reporting low rates of ocular involvement in fungemia. This study demonstrates an application of natural language processing to expedite the review of narrative notes. This approach is highly relevant for ophthalmology, where diagnoses are often based on physical examination findings that are documented within clinical notes.","Baxter, Klie, Radha Saseendrakumar, Ye, Hogarth","https://doi.org/10.2196/18855","20200905","diagnosis codes; electronic health records; fungal endophthalmitis; fungal ocular involvement; fungemia; natural language processing; regular expressions; unstructured data","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16340,""
"Evidence-based approach to setting delta check rules","Delta checks are a post-analytical verification tool that compare the difference in sequential laboratory results belonging to the same patient against a predefined limit. This unique quality tool highlights a potential error at the individual patient level. A difference in sequential laboratory results that exceeds the predefined limit is considered likely to contain an error that requires further investigation that can be time and resource intensive. This may cause a delay in the provision of the result to the healthcare provider or entail recollection of the patient sample. Delta checks have been used primarily to detect sample misidentification (sample mix-up, wrong blood in tube), and recent advancements in laboratory medicine, including the adoption of protocolized procedures, information technology and automation in the total testing process, have significantly reduced the prevalence of such errors. As such, delta check rules need to be selected carefully to balance the clinical risk of these errors and the need to maintain operational efficiency. Historically, delta check rules have been set by professional opinion based on reference change values (biological variation) or the published literature. Delta check rules implemented in this manner may not inform laboratory practitioners of their real-world performance. This review discusses several evidence-based approaches to the optimal setting of delta check rules that directly inform the laboratory practitioner of the error detection capabilities of the selected rules. Subsequent verification of workflow for the selected delta check rules is also discussed. This review is intended to provide practical assistance to laboratories in setting evidence-based delta check rules that best suits their local operational and clinical needs.","Markus, Tan, Loh","https://doi.org/10.1080/10408363.2020.1800585","20200815","Auto-verification; analytical error; delta check; laboratory error; post-analytical error; pre-analytical error; sample misidentification; sample mix-up; wrong blood in tube","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16341,""
"Trove: Ontology-driven weak supervision for medical entity classification","Recognizing named entities (NER) and their associated attributes like negation are core tasks in natural language processing. However, manually labeling data for entity tasks is time consuming and expensive, creating barriers to using machine learning in new medical applications. Weakly supervised learning, which automatically builds imperfect training sets from low cost, less accurate labeling rules, offers a potential solution. Medical ontologies are compelling sources for generating labels, however combining multiple ontologies without ground truth data creates challenges due to label noise introduced by conflicting entity definitions. Key questions remain on the extent to which weakly supervised entity classification can be automated using ontologies, or how much additional task-specific rule engineering is required for state-of-the-art performance. Also unclear is how pre-trained language models, such as BioBERT, improve the ability to generalize from imperfectly labeled data. We present Trove, a framework for weakly supervised entity classification using medical ontologies. We report state-of-the-art, weakly supervised performance on two NER benchmark datasets and establish new baselines for two entity classification tasks in clinical text. We perform within an average of 3.5 F1 points (4.2%) of NER classifiers trained with hand-labeled data. Automatically learning label source accuracies to correct for label noise provided an average improvement of 3.9 F1 points. BioBERT provided an average improvement of 0.9 F1 points. We measure the impact of combining large numbers of ontologies and present a case study on rapidly building classifiers for COVID-19 clinical tasks. Our framework demonstrates how a wide range of medical entity classifiers can be quickly constructed using weak supervision and without requiring manually-labeled training data.","Fries, Steinberg, Khattar, Fleming, Posada, Callahan, Shah","https://www.google.com/search?q=Trove:+Ontology-driven+weak+supervision+for+medical+entity+classification.","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16342,""
"Discovery of Selenocysteine as aÃ‚Â Potential Nanomedicine Promotes Cartilage Regeneration With Enhanced Immune Response by Text Mining and Biomedical Databases","Unlike bone tissue, little progress has been made regarding cartilage regeneration, and many challenges remain. Furthermore, the key roles of cartilage lesion caused by traumas, focal lesion, or articular overstress remain unclear. Traumatic injuries to the meniscus as well as its degeneration are important risk factors for long-term joint dysfunction, degenerative joint lesions, and knee osteoarthritis (OA) a chronic joint disease characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage and hyperosteogeny. Nearly 50% of the individuals with meniscus injuries develop OA over time. Due to the limited inherent self-repair capacity of cartilage lesion, the Biomaterial drug-nanomedicine is considered to be a promising alternative. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the gene potential regeneration mechanisms and discover novel precise medication, which are identified through this study to investigate their function and role in pathogenesis. We downloaded the mRNA microarray statistics GSE117999, involving paired cartilage lesion tissue samples from 12 OA patients and 12 patients from a control group. First, we analyzed these statistics to recognize the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We then exposed the gene ontology (GO) annotation and the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses for these DEGs. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were then constructed, from which we attained eight significant genes after a functional interaction analysis. Finally, we identified a potential nanomedicine attained from this assay set, using a wide range of inhibitor information archived in the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database. Sixty-six DEGs were identified with our standards for meaning (adjusted P-value &lt; 0.01, |log2 - FC| Ã¢â€°Â¥1.2). Furthermore, we identified eight hub genes and one potential nanomedicine - Selenocysteine based on these integrative data. We identified eight hub genes that could work as prospective biomarkers for the diagnostic and biomaterial drug treatment of cartilage lesion, involving the novel genes <i>CAMP</i>, <i>DEFA3</i>, <i>TOLLIP</i>, <i>HLA-DQA2</i>, <i>SLC38A6</i>, <i>SLC3A1</i>, <i>FAM20A</i>, and <i>ANO8</i>. Meanwhile, these genes were mainly associated with immune response, immune mediator induction, and cell chemotaxis. Significant support is provided for obtaining a series of novel gene targets, and we identify potential mechanisms for cartilage regeneration and final nanomedicine immunotherapy in regenerative medicine.","Ye, Xu, Fan, Zhang, Yuan, Chen, Sun, Yan, Song, Song, Yang, Yu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.01138","20200928","biomaterial drug; cartilage; clinical translation; immune response; nanomedicine; text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16343,""
"Variability and reproducibility in deep learning for medical image segmentation","Medical image segmentation is an important tool for current clinical applications. It is the backbone of numerous clinical diagnosis methods, oncological treatments and computer-integrated surgeries. A new class of machine learning algorithm, deep learning algorithms, outperforms the results of classical segmentation in terms of accuracy. However, these techniques are complex and can have a high range of variability, calling the reproducibility of the results into question. In this article, through a literature review, we propose an original overview of the sources of variability to better understand the challenges and issues of reproducibility related to deep learning for medical image segmentation. Finally, we propose 3 main recommendations to address these potential issues: (1) an adequate description of the framework of deep learning, (2) a suitable analysis of the different sources of variability in the framework of deep learning, and (3) an efficient system for evaluating the segmentation results.","Renard, Guedria, Palma, Vuillerme","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69920-0","20201030","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16344,""

According to the data source of the literatures, we constructed simulation database used as the sample set to conduct model training, and part of the clinical data was used to train the model accuracy. <b>Result:</b>After trainings, the accuracy rate of ANN model was 52.3%, and that of SVM model was 83.4%. The error mainly comes from the serious overlap of each score data interval under the three diagnostic schemes, which easily leads to the misclassification of boundary sample points, which is also a difficult problem to overcome in clinical diagnosis. <b>Conclusion:</b>Vestibular rehabilitation decision based SVM is more accurate than ANN.

"New technologies in breast cancer sentinel lymph node biopsy; from the current gold standard to artificial intelligence","Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an important diagnostic procedure performed in early breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes. Detection and examination of sentinel lymph nodes determine further therapy decisions, therefore a choice of optimal technique minimising the risk of false-negative results is of great importance. Currently, the gold standard is the dual technique comprising the blue dye and radiotracer, however, this method creates a logistical problem for many medical units. The intrinsic constraints of the existing methods led to the development of a very wide range of alternatives with varying clinical efficiency and feasibility. While each method presents with its own advantages and disadvantages, many techniques have improved enough to become a non-inferior alternative in the sentinel lymph node biopsy. Along with the improvement of the existing technologies, there are evolving trends such as multimodality of the techniques maximising the diagnostic outcome or an emerging use of artificial intelligence (AI) improving the workflow of the procedure. This literature review aims to give an overview of the current status of the standard techniques and emerging cutting-edge technologies in the sentinel lymph node biopsy.","Cykowska, Marano, D'Ignazio, Marrelli, Swierblewski, Jaskiewicz, Roviello, Polom","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.suronc.2020.06.005","20200907","Artificial intelligence; Breast cancer; Dual technique; Indocyanine green; Sentinel lymph node biopsy; Superparamagnetic iron oxides (SPIO)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16346,""
"The effect of neighborhood social environment on prostate cancer development in black and white men at high risk for prostate cancer","Neighborhood socioeconomic (nSES) factors have been implicated in prostate cancer (PCa) disparities. In line with the Precision Medicine Initiative that suggests clinical and socioenvironmental factors can impact PCa outcomes, we determined whether nSES variables are associated with time to PCa diagnosis and could inform PCa clinical risk assessment. The study sample included 358 high risk men (PCa family history and/or Black race), aged 35-69 years, enrolled in an early detection program. Patient variables were linked to 78 nSES variables (employment, income, etc.) from previous literature via geocoding. Patient-level models, including baseline age, prostate specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal exam, as well as combined models (patient plus nSES variables) by race/PCa family history subgroups were built after variable reduction methods using Cox regression and LASSO machine-learning. Model fit of patient and combined models (AIC) were compared; p-values&lt;0.05 were significant. Model-based high/low nSES exposure scores were calculated and the 5-year predicted probability of PCa was plotted against PSA by high/low neighborhood score to preliminarily assess clinical relevance. In combined models, nSES variables were significantly associated with time to PCa diagnosis. Workers mode of transportation and low income were significant in White men with a PCa family history. Homeownership (%owner-occupied houses with &gt;3 bedrooms) and unemployment were significant in Black men with and without a PCa family history, respectively. The 5-year predicted probability of PCa was higher in men with a high neighborhood score (weighted combination of significant nSES variables) compared to a low score (e.g., Baseline PSA level of 4ng/mL for men with PCa family history: White-26.7% vs 7.7%; Black-56.2% vs 29.7%). Utilizing neighborhood data during patient risk assessment may be useful for high risk men affected by disparities.

"The cost-utility of intravenous magnesium sulfate for treating asthma exacerbations in children","Although evidence supports the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (MS) in asthma exacerbations, MS continues to be considered a second-line drug for managing pediatric asthma exacerbations. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility of MS in asthma exacerbations. We used a decision tree model to estimate the cost-utility of MS compared to treatment without MS (control group) in children with asthma exacerbations. Cost data were obtained from a retrospective study from tertiary centers in Rionegro, Colombia, while utilities were collected from the literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was carried out using the Monte Carlo technique with a simulation of a hypothetical cohort of 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 patients to generate expected cost utilities with 95% confidence intervals. We used a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve to evaluate the uncertainty surrounding the cost-utility of MS. The model showed that MS had a lower total cost than the control group (US $1149 vs US $1598 average cost per patient) and higher quality-adjusted life years (0.60 vs 0.52 average per patient), showing dominance. The probability that MS provides a more cost-effective use of resources compared with standard therapy exceeds 99% for all willingness-to-pay thresholds. Intravenous MS was less expensive and more effective than treatment without intravenous MS in children with asthma exacerbations. Our study provides evidence that should be used by decision-makers to improve clinical practice guidelines and should be replicated to validate its results in other middle-income countries.","Buendia, AcuÃƒÂ±a-Cordero, Rodriguez-Martinez","https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25024","20200822","health care; health economics; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16348,""
"Bag-of-features-based radiomics for differentiation of ocular adnexal lymphoma and idiopathic orbital inflammation from contrast-enhanced MRI","To evaluate the effectiveness of bag-of-features (BOF)-based radiomics for differentiating ocular adnexal lymphoma (OAL) and idiopathic orbital inflammation (IOI) from contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI). Fifty-six patients with pathologically confirmed IOI (28 patients) and OAL (28 patients) were randomly divided into training (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°42) and testing (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14) groups. One hundred sixty texture features extracted from the CE-MR image were encoded into the BOF representation with fewer features. The support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel was used as the classifier. Data augmented was performed by cropping orbital lesions in different directions to alleviate the over-fitting problem. Student's t test and the Holm-Bonferroni method were employed to compare the performance of different analysis methods. The chi-square test was used to compare the analysis with MRI and human radiological diagnosis. In the independent testing group, the differentiation by the BOF features with augmentation achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.725-0.880), which was significantly higher than that of the BOF features without augmentation and that of the texture features (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). In addition, the same radiomic analysis with pre-contrast MRI obtained an AUC of 0.618 (95% CI: 0.560-0.677), which was significantly lower than that with CE-MRI. The diagnostic performance of the analysis with CE-MRI was significantly better than the radiology resident (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) but had no significant difference with the experienced radiologist, even though there was less consistency between the radiomic analysis and the human visual diagnosis. The BOF-based radiomics may be helpful for the differentiation between OAL and IOI. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ It is challenging to differentiate OAL from IOI due to the similar clinical and image features. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Radiomics has great potential for the noninvasive diagnosis of orbital diseases. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The BOF representation from patch to image may help the differentiation of OAL and IOI.","Hou, Xie, Chen, Lv, Jiang, He, Yang, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07110-2","20200813","Lymphoma; Magnetic resonance imaging; Orbital pseudotumor; Support vector machine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16349,""
"A guide to writing systematic reviews of rare disease treatments to generate FAIR-compliant datasets: building a Treatabolome","Rare diseases are individually rare but globally affect around 6% of the population, and in over 70% of cases are genetically determined. Their rarity translates into a delayed diagnosis, with 25% of patients waiting 5 to 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°years for one. It is essential to raise awareness of patients and clinicians of existing gene and variant-specific therapeutics at the time of diagnosis to avoid that treatment delays add up to the diagnostic odyssey of rare diseases' patients and their families. This paper aims to provide guidance and give detailed instructions on how to write homogeneous systematic reviews of rare diseases' treatments in a manner that allows the capture of the results in a computer-accessible form. The published results need to comply with the FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship to facilitate the extraction of datasets that are easily transposable into machine-actionable information. The ultimate purpose is the creation of a database of rare disease treatments (&quot;Treatabolome&quot;) at gene and variant levels as part of the H2020 research project Solve-RD. Each systematic review follows a written protocol to address one or more rare diseases in which the authors are experts. The bibliographic search strategy requires detailed documentation to allow its replication. Data capture forms should be built to facilitate the filling of a data capture spreadsheet and to record the application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria to each search result. A PRISMA flowchart is required to provide an overview of the processes of search and selection of papers.

"Levofloxacin prophylaxis in hospitalized children with leukemia: A cost-utility analysis","Infections are common and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality during treatment of childhood leukemia. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of levofloxacin antibiotic prophylaxis, compared to no prophylaxis, in children receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A cost-utility analysis was conducted from the perspective of the single-payer health care system using a lifetime horizon. A comprehensive literature review identified available evidence for effectiveness, safety, costs of antibiotic prophylaxis in children with leukemia, and health utilities associated with the relevant health states. The effects of levofloxacin prophylaxis on health outcomes, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), and direct health costs were derived from a combined decision tree and state-transition model. One-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the sensitivity of results to parameter uncertainty. The literature review revealed one randomized controlled trial on levofloxacin prophylaxis in childhood AML and relapsed ALL, by Alexander etÃ‚Â al, that showed a significant reduction in rates of fever and neutropenia (71.2% vs 82.1%) and bacteremia (21.9% vs 43.4%) with levofloxacin compared to no prophylaxis. In our cost-utility analysis, levofloxacin prophylaxis was dominant over no prophylaxis, resulting in cost savings of $542.44 and increased survival of 0.13 QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, levofloxacin prophylaxis was dominant in 98.8% of iterations. The present analysis suggests that levofloxacin prophylaxis, compared to no prophylaxis, is cost saving in children receiving intensive chemotherapy for AML or relapsed ALL.","Maser, Pelland-Marcotte, Alexander, Sung, Gupta","https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.28643","20200813","antibiotic prophylaxis; bacteremia; infections; leukemia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16351,""
"Radiomics in medical imaging-&quot;how-to&quot; guide and critical reflection","Radiomics is a quantitative approach to medical imaging, which aims at enhancing the existing data available to clinicians by means of advanced mathematical analysis. Through mathematical extraction of the spatial distribution of signal intensities and pixel interrelationships, radiomics quantifies textural information by using analysis methods from the field of artificial intelligence. Various studies from different fields in imaging have been published so far, highlighting the potential of radiomics to enhance clinical decision-making. However, the field faces several important challenges, which are mainly caused by the various technical factors influencing the extracted radiomic features.The aim of the present review is twofold: first, we present the typical workflow of a radiomics analysis and deliver a practical &quot;how-to&quot; guide for a typical radiomics analysis. Second, we discuss the current limitations of radiomics, suggest potential improvements, and summarize relevant literature on the subject.","van Timmeren, Cester, Tanadini-Lang, Alkadhi, Baessler","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13244-020-00887-2","20200928","Machine learning; Quantitative imaging biomarkers; Radiomics; Robustness; Standardization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16352,""
"A bibliometric analysis of 23,492 publications on rectal cancer by machine learning: basic medical research is needed","The aim of this study was to analyse the landscape of publications on rectal cancer (RC) over the past 25Ã¢â‚¬â€°years by machine learning and semantic analysis. Publications indexed in PubMed under the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term 'Rectal Neoplasms' from 1994 to 2018 were downloaded in September 2019. R and Python were used to extract publication date, MeSH terms and abstract from the metadata of each publication for bibliometric assessment. Latent Dirichlet allocation was applied to analyse the text from the articles' abstracts to identify more specific research topics. Louvain algorithm was used to establish a topic network resulting in identifying the relationship between the topics. A total of 23,492 papers published were identified and analysed in this study. The changes of research focus were analysed by the changing of MeSH terms. Studied contents extracted from the publications were divided into five areas, including surgical intervention, radiotherapy and chemotherapy intervention, clinical case management, epidemiology and cancer risk as well as prognosis studies. The number of publications indexed on RC has expanded rapidly over the past 25Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Studies on RC have mainly focused on five areas. However, studies on basic research, postoperative quality of life and cost-effective research were relatively lacking. It is predicted that basic research, inflammation and some other research fields might become the potential hotspots in the future.","Wang, Feng, Li, Pei, Li, Zhu, Song, Pei, Tan","https://doi.org/10.1177/1756284820934594","20200928","LDA analyses; bibliometric analysis; machine learning; rectal cancer","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16353,""
"Cost utility analysis of tisagenlecleucel vs salvage chemotherapy in the treatment of relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from Singapore's healthcare system perspective","Patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL) have limited treatment options and poor prognoses. Tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has shown early promise in improving survival outcomes, but at a high upfront cost. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel versus salvage chemotherapy for treating patients with r/r DLBCL who have failed at least 2 lines of systemic therapies. A hybrid decision tree and three-state partitioned survival model (progression-free (PF), progressive disease and death) was developed from the Singapore healthcare payer perspective. Survival curves from JULIET trial and CORAL-1 extension study were extrapolated beyond trial period over a 15-year time horizon to estimate the underlying progression-free survival and overall survival parametric distributions for both arms. Health state utilities were retrieved from the literature, and direct costs were sourced from public healthcare institutions in Singapore. One-way probabilistic sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties and assumptions on cost-effectiveness results. Compared with salvage chemotherapy, tisagenlecleucel was associated with a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) US$508,530 (S$686,516) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained and US$320,200 (S$432,269) per life year (LY) gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the ICER was most sensitive to time horizon, PF utility and cost of tisagenlecleucel. Scenario analyses confirmed that the ICERs remained high under favorable assumptions and substantial price reduction was required to reduce the ICER. Our analysis showed tisagenlecleucel use in r/r DLBCL patients who failed at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapies was associated with exceedingly high ICER, which is unlikely to represent good use of healthcare resources. Comparative clinical evidence from the ongoing trials might provide more insight into future evaluations.","Cher, Gan, Aziz, Lin, Hwang, Poon, Ng","https://doi.org/10.1080/13696998.2020.1808981","20200825","CAR-T; H51; I18; Tisagenlecleucel; cost-effectiveness; partitioned-survival; relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16354,""
"Emerging Technologies With Potential Care and Support Applications for Older People: Review of Gray Literature","The number of older people with unmet care and support needs is increasing substantially due to the challenges facing the formal and informal care systems. Emerging technological developments have the potential to address some of the care and support challenges of older people. However, limited work has been done to identify emerging technological developments with the potential to meet the care and support needs of the aging population. This review aimed to gain an overview of emerging technologies with potential care and support applications for older people, particularly for those living at home. A scoping gray literature review was carried out by using the databases of 13 key organizations, hand searching reference lists of included documents, using funding data, and consulting technology experts. A narrative synthesis approach was used to analyze and summarize the findings of the literature review. A total of 39 documents were included in the final analysis. From the analysis, 8 emerging technologies were identified that could potentially be used to meet older people's needs in various care and support domains. These emerging technologies were (1) assistive autonomous robots; (2) self-driving vehicles; (3) artificial intelligence-enabled health smart apps and wearables; (4) new drug release mechanisms; (5) portable diagnostics; (6) voice-activated devices; (7) virtual, augmented, and mixed reality; and (8) intelligent homes. These emerging technologies were at different levels of development, with some being trialed for care applications, whereas others being in the early phases of development. However, only a few documents mentioned including older people during the process of designing and developing these technologies. This review has identified key emerging technologies with the potential to contribute to the support and care needs of older people. However, to increase the adoption of these technologies by older people, there is a need to involve them and other stakeholders, such as formal and informal carers, in the process of designing and developing these technologies.","Abdi, de Witte, Hawley","https://doi.org/10.2196/17286","20200928","artificial intelligence; care and support; emerging technologies; internet of things; mobile phone; older people; robotics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16355,""
"Obesity, the new childhood disability? An umbrella review on the association between adiposity and physical function","The adverse physical impacts of childhood obesity are increasingly being recognized. The objective of this study is to examine relationships between physical function and adiposity in youth. An umbrella review searched seven databases from inception to May 2019 for systematic reviews examining associations between adiposity and physical function in 0-20-year-olds. Findings were synthesized using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Framework and NHMRC FORM. Seventeen of 21 systematic reviews reported impairments to body function, including cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), muscle function, balance/coordination, gait biomechanics, pain and injury. Six reviews reported activity restrictions in motor skills, running speed/agility and functional mobility, and two found inverse associations between adiposity and physical health-related quality of life (p-HRQOL). Some causal relationships indicated that adiposity inversely predicted p-HRQOL/CRF and CRF/muscle function inversely predicted adiposity. Assessments of physical function were heterogeneous and impacts on participation in life situations meaningful to the individual were largely unknown. Substantial evidence associates childhood overweight/obesity with reduced physical function. Associations were mainly cross-sectional, with causative evidence for some outcomes. Comprehensive physical function assessments by qualified health professionals are needed, along with targeted interventions to address deficits. Research should further examine causality of relationships, underlying mechanisms and participation challenges in real-life contexts.","Tsiros, Tian, Shultz, Olds, Hills, Duff, Kumar","https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13121","20200811","BMI; body mass index; children","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16356,""
"Association between diabetic neuropathy and osteoporosis in patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Many studies have explored the association between neuropathy and osteoporosis in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, the results still remain inconsistent and controversial. We aimed to estimate the association between diabetic neuropathy and osteoporosis. Databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane library, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and Wanfang, were screened from inception to 30 March 2020. Studies were selected and data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Study characteristics and quality sections were reviewed independently. Pooled ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using random effects model when evidence of heterogeneity was present; otherwise, fixed effects model was used. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to explore the source of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias were also tested. A total of 11 studies with 27,585 participants were included in this analysis which indicated that there was an increased odd between diabetic neuropathy and osteoporosis (overall OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.71-2.83). In the subgroup analyses and meta-regression, diabetic neuropathy has no significant difference in osteoporosis or fracture (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.532). And osteoporosis also has no significant difference in type 1 or type 2 diabetic neuropathy (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.668). This meta-analysis suggests that patients with diabetic neuropathy have a significantly increased chance of developing osteoporosis, even fragility fracture. The clinicians should pay more attention to the patients with diabetic neuropathy. Further studies were still needed to explore the confounding factors among studies and to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms.","Liu, Lv, Niu, Tan, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11657-020-00804-6","20200817","Diabetic neuropathy; Fracture; Meta-analysis; Osteoporosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16357,""
"Better one or two? A systematic review of portable automated refractors","More than 400 million people suffer from visual impairment globally, with more than half due to uncorrected refractive error. Autorefraction (AR) is the most common examination performed prior to prescribing glasses. As technology advances, so has the accuracy and number of portable autorefractors available. Portable technology has become acutely important with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the conversion of in-person clinical evaluations to remote telemedicine encounters. Patients and providers want to do as much as possible remotely. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review of the accuracy and effectiveness of available portable automated refractors compared to the current standard of care, subjective refraction (SR). A literature search of PubMED, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov 97 unique publications in English on portable autorefractors. Twelve studies comparing a portable AR device to at least one form of SR were systematically included in this review. There were four portable autorefractors (Netra, Quicksee, Retinomax and SVOne) studied against SR. There was high patient acceptance of glasses prescriptions by the Quicksee alone, with 87% subjects seeing the same or better than SR. Quicksee was more accurate than Netra and Retinomax. SVOne was preferred over Netra and outperformed Retinomax in multiple measures, despite Retinomax being the fastest test. There are numerous portable autorefractors available, but few were compared against SR. Quicksee and SVOne are the most accurate and patient-preferred devices. Quicksee was the most accurate, and it performed clinically the same as SR in some reports.","Samanta, Shetty, Nelson","https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633X20940140","20200811","Home telecare; remote consultation; tele-ophthalmology; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16358,""
"Cross-Modal Data Programming Enables Rapid Medical Machine Learning","A major bottleneck in developing clinically impactful machine learning models is a lack of labeled training data for model supervision. Thus, medical researchers increasingly turn to weaker, noisier sources of supervision, such as leveraging extractions from unstructured text reports to supervise image classification. A key challenge in weak supervision is combining sources of information that may differ in quality and have correlated errors. Recently, a statistical theory of weak supervision called data programming has shown promise in addressing this challenge. Data programming now underpins many deployed machine-learning systems in the technology industry, even for critical applications. We propose a new technique for applying data programming to the problem of cross-modal weak supervision in medicine, wherein weak labels derived from an auxiliary modality (e.g., text) are used to train models over a different target modality (e.g., images). We evaluate our approach on diverse clinical tasks via direct comparison to institution-scale, hand-labeled datasets. We find that our supervision technique increases model performance by up to 6 points area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) over baseline methods by improving both coverage and quality of the weak labels. Our approach yields models that on average perform within 1.75 points ROC-AUC of those supervised with physician-years of hand labeling and outperform those supervised with physician-months of hand labeling by 10.25 points ROC-AUC, while using only person-days of developer time and clinician work-a time saving of 96%. Our results suggest that modern weak supervision techniques such as data programming may enable more rapid development and deployment of clinically useful machine-learning models.","Dunnmon, Ratner, Saab, Khandwala, Markert, Sagreiya, Goldman, Lee-Messer, Lungren, Rubin, RÃƒÂ©","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2020.100019","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16359,""

"Portable Automated Surveillance of Surgical Site Infections Using Natural Language Processing: Development and Validation","We present the development and validation of a portable NLP approach for automated surveillance of SSIs. The surveillance of SSIs is labor-intensive limiting the generalizability and scalability of surgical quality surveillance programs. We abstracted patient clinical text notes after surgical procedures from 2 independent healthcare systems using different electronic healthcare records. An SSI detected as part of the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was used as the reference standard. We developed a rules-based NLP system (Easy Clinical Information Extractor [CIE]-SSI) for operative event-level detection of SSIs using an training cohort (4574 operative events) from 1 healthcare system and then conducted internal validation on a blind cohort from the same healthcare system (1850 operative events) and external validation on a blind cohort from the second healthcare system (15,360 operative events). EasyCIE-SSI performance was measured using sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver-operating-curve (AUC). The prevalence of SSI was 4% and 5% in the internal and external validation corpora. In internal validation, EasyCIE-SSI had a sensitivity, specificity, AUC of 94%, 88%, 0.912 for the detection of SSI, respectively. In external validation, EasyCIE-SSI had sensitivity, specificity, AUC of 79%, 92%, 0.852 for the detection of SSI, respectively. The sensitivity of EasyCIE-SSI decreased in clean, skin/subcutaneous, and outpatient procedures in the external validation compared to internal validation.

Predictors included age, gender, region of onset, symptom duration, weight at baseline, functional impairment, and estimated rate of functional loss. UMAP projection of patients shows an informative 2D data distribution. As limited data availability precluded complex model designs, the projection was divided into three zones with relevant survival rates. These rates were defined using confidence bounds: high, intermediate, and low 1-year survival rates at respectively [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]), [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) and [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]).

"Accuracy of deep learning for automated detection of pneumonia using chest X-Ray images: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Recently, deep learning (DL) algorithms have received widespread popularity in various medical diagnostics. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of DL models in the detection and classifying of pneumonia using chest X-ray (CXR) images. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched in order to retrieve all studies that implemented a DL algorithm for discriminating pneumonia patients from healthy controls using CXR images. We used bivariate linear mixed models to pool diagnostic estimates including sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). Also, the area under receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) of the included studies was used to estimate the diagnostic value. The pooled SE, SP, PLR, NLR, DOR and AUC for DL in discriminating pneumonia CXRs from controls were 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.96-0.99), 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90-0.96), 15.35 (95% CI: 10.04-23.48), 0.02 (95% CI: 0.01-0.04), 718.13 (95% CI: 288.45-1787.93), and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98-100), respectively. The pooled SE, SP, PLR, NLR, DOR and AUC for DL in discriminating bacterial from viral pneumonia using CXR radiographs were 0.89 (95% CI: 0.79-0.94), 0.89 (95% CI: 0.78-0.95), 8.34 (95% CI: 3.75-18.55), 0.13 (95% CI: 0.06-0.26), 66.14 (95% CI: 17.34-252.37), and 0.95 (0.93-0.97). DL indicated high accuracy performance in classifying pneumonia from normal CXR radiographs and also in distinguishing bacterial from viral pneumonia. However, major methodological concerns should be addressed in future studies for translating to the clinic.","Li, Zhang, Dai, Dong, Badrigilan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103898","20200810","Artificial intelligence; CXR; Deep learning; Meta-analysis; Pneumonia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16367,""
"Predicting Absenteeism and Temporary Disability Using Machine Learning: a Systematic Review and Analysis","The main objective of this paper is to present a systematic analysis and review of the state of the art regarding the prediction of absenteeism and temporary incapacity using machine learning techniques. Moreover, the main contribution of this research is to reveal the most successful prediction models available in the literature. A systematic review of research papers published from 2010 to the present, related to the prediction of temporary disability and absenteeism in available in different research databases, is presented in this paper. The review focuses primarily on scientific databases such as Google Scholar, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and ResearchGate. A total of 58 articles were obtained from which, after removing duplicates and applying the search criteria, 18 have been included in the review. In total, 44% of the articles were published in 2019, representing a significant growth in scientific work regarding these indicators. This study also evidenced the interest of several countries. In addition, 56% of the articles were found to base their study on regression methods, 33% in classification, and 11% in grouping. After this systematic review, the efficiency and usefulness of artificial neural networks in predicting absenteeism and temporary incapacity are demonstrated. The studies regarding absenteeism and temporary disability at work are mainly conducted in Brazil and India, which are responsible for 44% of the analyzed papers followed by Saudi Arabia, and Australia which represented 22%. ANNs are the most used method in both classification and regression models representing 83% and 80% of the analyzed works, respectively. Only 10% of the literature use SVM, which is the less used method in regression models. Moreover, NaÃƒÂ¯ve Bayes is the less used method in classification models representing 17%.","Montano, Marques, Alonso, LÃƒÂ³pez-Coronado, de la Torre DÃƒÂ­ez","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-020-01626-2","20200810","Absenteeism; Artificial neural networks; Machine learning; Temporary disability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16368,""
"A review of auditing techniques for the Unified Medical Language System","The study sought to describe the literature related to the development of methods for auditing the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), with particular attention to identifying errors and inconsistencies of attributes of the concepts in the UMLS Metathesaurus. We applied the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) approach by searchingÃ‚Â the MEDLINE database and Google Scholar for studies referencing the UMLS and any of several terms related to auditing, error detection, and quality assurance. A qualitative analysis and summarization of articles that met inclusion criteria were performed. Eighty-three studies were reviewed in detail. We first categorized techniques based on various aspects including concepts, concept names, and synonymy (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°37), semantic type assignments (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°36), hierarchical relationships (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°24), lateral relationships (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12), ontology enrichment (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8), and ontology alignment (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18). We also categorized the methods according to their level of automation (ie, automated systematic, automated heuristic, or manual) and the type of knowledge used (ie, intrinsic or extrinsic knowledge). This study is a comprehensive review of the published methods for auditing the various conceptual aspects of the UMLS. Categorizing the auditing techniques according to the various aspects will enable the curators of the UMLS as well as researchers comprehensive easy access to this wealth of knowledge (eg, for auditing lateral relationships in the UMLS). We also reviewed ontology enrichment and alignment techniques due to their critical use of and impact on the UMLS.","Zheng, He, Wei, Keloth, Fan, Lindemann, Zhu, Cimino, Perl","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa108","20201022","auditing; quality assurance; review; unified medical language system","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16369,""
"Graft survival and endothelial outcomes after penetrating keratoplasty and Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis","The present study aimed to compare the outcomes of graft survival, endothelial cell loss and vision improvement between penetrating keratoplasty (PK) and Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) for treating corneal endothelium diseases. The PubMed, CENTRAL (Cochrane) and Embase databases were searched for records added until September 20, 2019. The studies considered were two-arm prospective and retrospective studies comparing outcomes of interest between PK and DSAEK. Ultimately, 10 studies were included with a total of 2,634 patients (910 eyes treated with DSAEK; 1,804 eyes treated with PK). Assessment of the summary effect by meta-analysis suggested that, compared with PK treatment, DSAEK was associated with a greater improvement from baseline in best spectacle-corrected visual acuity [difference (diff.) in means of change from baseline=-0.225, 95% CI=-0.341 to -0.109, P&lt;0.001] and a reduced loss of endothelial cell density (diff. in means=-292.05 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI=-419.53 to -146.57 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>, P&lt;0.001). Graft survival rates were similar using either PK or DSAEK (odds ratio=1.005, 95% CI=0.329-3.071, P=0.993). The overall results suggested that DSAEK may have an advantage over PK for corneal endothelial dysfunction in terms of the visual acuity outcome. The absence of definite time frames in the comparisons limits the conclusions on endothelial cell loss and graft survival.","Yang, Zhao, Lu, Zang, Mao, Hong, Jie","https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2020.9010","20200928","Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty; endothelial cell loss; graft survival; meta-analysis; penetrating keratoplasty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16370,""

"Conversational Agents in Health Care: Scoping Review and Conceptual Analysis","Conversational agents, also known as chatbots, are computer programs designed to simulate human text or verbal conversations. They are increasingly used in a range of fields, including health care. By enabling better accessibility, personalization, and efficiency, conversational agents have the potential to improve patient care. This study aimed to review the current applications, gaps, and challenges in the literature on conversational agents in health care and provide recommendations for their future research, design, and application. We performed a scoping review. A broad literature search was performed in MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online; Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database; Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central with the search terms &quot;conversational agents,&quot; &quot;conversational AI,&quot; &quot;chatbots,&quot; and associated synonyms. We also searched the gray literature using sources such as the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) WorldCat database and ResearchGate in April 2019. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked for further articles. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by 2 reviewers. The included evidence was analyzed narratively by employing the principles of thematic analysis. The literature search yielded 47 study reports (45 articles and 2 ongoing clinical trials) that matched the inclusion criteria. The identified conversational agents were largely delivered via smartphone apps (n=23) and used free text only as the main input (n=19) and output (n=30) modality. Case studies describing chatbot development (n=18) were the most prevalent, and only 11 randomized controlled trials were identified. The 3 most commonly reported conversational agent applications in the literature were treatment and monitoring, health care service support, and patient education. The literature on conversational agents in health care is largely descriptive and aimed at treatment and monitoring and health service support. It mostly reports on text-based, artificial intelligence-driven, and smartphone app-delivered conversational agents. There is an urgent need for a robust evaluation of diverse health care conversational agents' formats, focusing on their acceptability, safety, and effectiveness.","Tudor Car, Dhinagaran, Kyaw, Kowatsch, Joty, Theng, Atun","https://doi.org/10.2196/17158","20200905","artificial intelligence; chatbots; conversational agents; health care; machine learning; mobile phone; scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16372,""
"Comparing a Mobile Phone Automated System With a Paper and Email Data Collection System: Substudy Within a Randomized Controlled Trial","Traditional data collection methods using paper and email are increasingly being replaced by data collection using mobile phones, although there is limited evidence evaluating the impact of mobile phone technology as part of an automated research management system on data collection and health outcomes. The aim of this study is to compare a web-based mobile phone automated system (MPAS) with a more traditional delivery and data collection system combining paper and email data collection (PEDC) in a cohort of breastfeeding women. We conducted a substudy of a randomized controlled trial in Sydney, Australia, which included women with uncomplicated term births who intended to breastfeed. Women were recruited within 72 hours of giving birth. A quasi-randomized number of women were recruited using the PEDC system, and the remainder were recruited using the MPAS. The outcomes assessed included the effectiveness of data collection, impact on study outcomes, response rate, acceptability, and cost analysis between the MPAS and PEDC methods. Women were recruited between April 2015 and December 2016. The analysis included 555 women: 471 using the MPAS and 84 using the PEDC. There were no differences in clinical outcomes between the 2 groups. At the end of the 8-week treatment phase, the MPAS group showed an increased response rate compared with the PEDC group (56% vs 37%; P&lt;.001), which was also seen at the 2-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. At the 2-month follow-up, the MPAS participants also showed an increased rate of self-reported treatment compliance (70% vs 56%; P&lt;.001) and a higher recommendation rate for future use (95% vs 64%; P&lt;.001) as compared with the PEDC group. The cost analysis between the 2 groups was comparable. MPAS is an effective and acceptable method for improving the overall management, treatment compliance, and methodological quality of clinical research to ensure the validity and reliability of findings.","Bond, Hammond, Shand, Nassar","https://doi.org/10.2196/15284","20201003","breastfeeding; clinical trial; data collection methods; maternal health; mobile phones; text messaging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16373,""
"Prediction of survival outcome based on clinical features and pretreatment <sup>18</sup>FDG-PET/CT for HNSCC patients","In this study, we have analysed pretreatment positron-emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) images of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. We have used a publicly available dataset for our analysis. The clinical features of the patient, PET quantitative parameters, and textural indices from pretreatment PET-CT images are selected for the study. The main objective of the study is to use classifiers to predict the outcome for HNSCC patients and compare the performance of the model with the conventional statistical model (CoxPH). We have applied a 40% fixed SUV threshold method for tumour delineation. Clinical features of each patient are provided in the dataset, and other features are calculated using LIFEx software. For predicting the outcome, we have implemented three classifiers - Random Forest classifier, Gradient Boosted Decision tree (GBDT) and Decision tree classifier. We have trained each model using 93 data points and test the model performance using 39 data points. The best model - GBDT is chosen based on the performance metrics. It is observed that typically three features: MTV (Metabolic tumour Volume), primary tumour site and GLCM_correlation are significant for prediction of survival outcome. For testing cohort, GBDT achieves a balanced accuracy of 88%, where conventional statistical model reported a balanced accuracy of 81.5%. The proposed classifier achieves higher accuracy than the state of the art technique. Using this classifier we can estimate the HNSCC patient's outcome, and depending upon the outcome treatment policy can be selected.","Ghosh, Maulik, Chatterjee, Mallick, Chakravorty, Mukherjee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105669","20200915","Classification; Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; Machine learning; Pretreatment (18)F FDG-PET/CT","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16374,""
"CAS: corpus of clinical cases in French","Textual corpora are extremely important for various NLP applications as they provide information necessary for creating, setting and testing those applications and the corresponding tools. They are also crucial for designing reliable methods and reproducible results. Yet, in some areas, such as the medical area, due to confidentiality or to ethical reasons, it is complicated or even impossible to access representative textual data. We propose the CAS corpus built with clinical cases, such as they are reported in the published scientific literature in French. Currently, the corpus contains 4,900 clinical cases in French, totaling nearly 1.7M word occurrences. Some clinical cases are associated with discussions. A subset of the whole set of cases is enriched with morpho-syntactic (PoS-tagging, lemmatization) and semantic (the UMLS concepts, negation, uncertainty) annotations. The corpus is being continuously enriched with new clinical cases and annotations. The CAS corpus has been compared with similar clinical narratives. When computed on tokenized and lowercase words, the Jaccard index indicates that the similarity between clinical cases and narratives reaches up to 0.9727. We assume that the CAS corpus can be effectively exploited for the development and testing of NLP tools and methods. Besides, the corpus will be used in NLP challenges and distributed to the research community.","Grabar, Dalloux, Claveau","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13326-020-00225-x","20200811","Corpus with clinical cases; Medical area; Morpho-syntactic and semantic annotation; Natural language processing; Reproducibility; Sustainability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16375,""
"Laparoscopic versus open subtotal gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma: cost-effectiveness analysis","Laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy (LSG) for cancer is associated with good perioperative outcomes and superior quality of life compared with the open approach, albeit at higher cost. An economic evaluation was conducted to compare the two approaches. A cost-effectiveness analysis between LSG and open subtotal gastrectomy (OSG) for gastric cancer was performed using a decision-tree cohort model with a healthcare system perspective and a 12-month time horizon. Model inputs were informed by a meta-analysis of relevant literature, with costs represented in 2016 Canadian dollars (CAD) and outcomes measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). A secondary analysis was conducted using inputs extracted solely from European and North American studies. Deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic (PSA) sensitivity analyses were performed. In the base-case model, costs of LSG were $935 (Ã¢â€šÂ¬565) greater than those of OSG, with an incremental gain of 0Ã‚Â·050 QALYs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $18Ã¢â‚¬â€°846 (Ã¢â€šÂ¬11Ã¢â‚¬â€°398) per additional QALY gained from LSG. In the DSA, results were most sensitive to changes in postoperative utility, operating theatre and equipment costs, as well as duration of surgery and hospital stay. PSA showed that the likelihood of LSG being cost-effective at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 (Ã¢â€šÂ¬30Ã¢â‚¬â€°240) per QALY and $100Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 (Ã¢â€šÂ¬60Ã¢â‚¬â€°480) per QALY was 64 and 68 per cent respectively. Secondary analysis using European and North American clinical inputs resulted in LSG being dominant (cheaper and more effective) over OSG, largely due to reduced length of stay after LSG. In this decision analysis model, LSG was cost-effective compared with OSG for gastric cancer. Pese a su mayor coste, la gastrectomÃƒÂ­a subtotal laparoscÃƒÂ³pica se asocia con buenos resultados perioperatorios y una mejor calidad de vida en comparaciÃƒÂ³n con la cirugÃƒÂ­a abierta en el tratamiento del cÃƒÂ¡ncer. Se realizÃƒÂ³ una evaluaciÃƒÂ³n econÃƒÂ³mica comparando los dos abordajes. MÃƒâ€°TODOS: Se efectuÃƒÂ³ un anÃƒÂ¡lisis de coste-efectividad de la gastrectomÃƒÂ­a subtotal laparoscÃƒÂ³pica (laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy, LSG) o de la gastrectomÃƒÂ­a subtotal abierta (open subtotal gastrectomy, OSG) en el cÃƒÂ¡ncer gÃƒÂ¡strico utilizando un modelo de cohortes con ÃƒÂ¡rbol de decisiÃƒÂ³n desde la perspectiva del sistema de salud y con un horizonte temporal de 12 meses. Los gastos del modelo fueron evaluados tras un metaanÃƒÂ¡lisis de literatura relevante y expresados en dÃƒÂ³lares canadienses (Canadian dollars, CAD) del 2016. Los resultados se midieron en aÃƒÂ±os de vida ajustados por su calidad (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs). Se realizÃƒÂ³ un anÃƒÂ¡lisis secundario utilizando los datos extraÃƒÂ­dos ÃƒÂºnicamente de estudios europeos y norteamericanos. AdemÃƒÂ¡s, se realizaron anÃƒÂ¡lisis de sensibilidad determinÃƒÂ­stico y probabilÃƒÂ­stico (deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, DSA y PSA). En el modelo del caso base, los costes de la LSG fueron de 934,78$ (565Ã¢â€šÂ¬) mÃƒÂ¡s que en la OSG, con una ganancia incremental de 0,050 QALYs, que supuso una relaciÃƒÂ³n coste-efectividad incremental (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, ICER) de 18.846,12$ (11.398Ã¢â€šÂ¬) por QALY adicional en la LSG. En el DSA, los resultados fueron mÃƒÂ¡s sensibles a cambios en el postoperatorio, quirÃƒÂ³fano y coste de los equipos, asÃƒÂ­ como en la duraciÃƒÂ³n de la intervenciÃƒÂ³n y la hospitalizaciÃƒÂ³n. El PSA demostrÃƒÂ³ que la probabilidad de que la LSG fuera rentable en tÃƒÂ©rminos de disposiciÃƒÂ³n de pago (willingness-to-pay, WTP) para dos umbrales, de 50.000$ (30.240Ã¢â€šÂ¬) y 100.000$ (60.480Ã¢â€šÂ¬) por QALY fue del 64% y del 68%, respectivamente. En el anÃƒÂ¡lisis secundario utilizando los datos europeos y norteamericanos se demostrÃƒÂ³ que la LSG era claramente dominante (mÃƒÂ¡s barata y mÃƒÂ¡s efectiva) que la OSG, en gran parte debido a la reducciÃƒÂ³n de la estancia hospitalaria de la LSG. CONCLUSIÃƒâ€œN: En este modelo de anÃƒÂ¡lisis de decisiÃƒÂ³n, la LSG fue coste-efectiva en comparaciÃƒÂ³n con la OSG para el cÃƒÂ¡ncer gÃƒÂ¡strico.","Gosselin-Tardif, Abou-Khalil, Mata, Guigui, Cools-Lartigue, Ferri, Lee, Mueller","https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs5.50327","20201006","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16376,""
"Machine learning for predicting long-term kidney allograft survival: a scoping review","Supervised machine learning (ML) is a class of algorithms that &quot;learn&quot; from existing input-output pairs, which is gaining popularity in pattern recognition for classification and prediction problems. In this scoping review, we examined the use of supervised ML algorithms for the prediction of long-term allograft survival in kidney transplant recipients. Data sources included PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore libraries from inception to November 2019. We screened titles and abstracts and potentially eligible full-text reports to select studies and subsequently abstracted the data. Eleven studies were identified. Decision trees were the most commonly used method (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8), followed by artificial neural networks (ANN) (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4) and Bayesian belief networks (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2). The area under receiver operating curve (AUC) was the most common measure of discrimination (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7), followed by sensitivity (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5) and specificity (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4). Model calibration examining the reliability in risk prediction was performed using either the Pearson r or the Hosmer-Lemeshow test in four studies. One study showed that logistic regression had comparable performance to ANN, while another study demonstrated that ANN performed better in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, as compared with a Cox proportional hazards model. We synthesized the evidence related to the comparison of ML techniques with traditional statistical approaches for prediction of long-term allograft survival in patients with a kidney transplant. The methodological and reporting quality of included studies was poor. Our study also demonstrated mixed results in terms of the predictive potential of the models.","Sekercioglu, Fu, Kim, Mitsakakis","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-020-02332-1","20200807","Chronic kidney allograft dysfunction; Risk prediction; Supervised machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16377,""
"Economic Evaluation of Sedative Deprescribing in Older Adults by Community Pharmacists","Sedative use in older adults increases the risk of falls, fractures, and hospitalizations. The D-PRESCRIBE (Developing Pharmacist-Led Research to Educate and Sensitize Community Residents to the Inappropriate Prescriptions Burden in the Elderly), pragmatic randomized clinical trial demonstrated that community-based, pharmacist-led education delivered simultaneously to older adults and their primary care providers reduce the use of sedatives by 43% over 6 months. However, the associated health benefits and cost savings have yet to be described. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the D-PRESCRIBE intervention compared to usual care for reducing the use of potentially inappropriate sedatives among older adults. A cost-utility analysis from the public health care perspective of Canada estimated the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with the D-PRESCRIBE intervention compared to usual care over a 1-year time horizon. Transition probabilities, intervention effectiveness, utility, and costs were derived from the literature. Probabilistic analyses were performed using a decision tree and Markov model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Compared to usual care, pharmacist-led deprescribing is less costly (-$1392.05 CAD) and more effective (0.0769 QALYs). Using common willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $50 000 and $100 000, D-PRESCRIBE was the optimal strategy. Scenario analysis indicated the cost-effectiveness of D-PRESCRIBE is sensitive to the rate of deprescribing. Community pharmacist-led deprescribing of sedatives is cost-effective, leading to greater quality-of-life and harm reduction among older adults. As the pharmacist's scope of practice expands, consideration should be given to interprofessional models of remuneration for quality prescribing and deprescribing services.","Turner, Sanyal, Martin, Tannenbaum","https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaa180","20200807","Cost-effectiveness; Falls; Health services; Hip fracture; Sedatives","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16378,""
"Characteristics and Outcomes of Contacts of COVID-19 Patients Monitored Using an Automated Symptom Monitoring Tool - Maine, May-June 2020","SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is spread from person to person (1-3). Quarantine of exposed persons (contacts) for 14 days following their exposure reduces transmission (4-7). Contact tracing provides an opportunity to identify contacts, inform them of quarantine recommendations, and monitor their symptoms to promptly identify secondary COVID-19 cases (7,8). On March 12, 2020, Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) identified the first case of COVID-19 in the state. Because of resource constraints, including staffing, Maine CDC could not consistently monitor contacts, and automated technological solutions for monitoring contacts were explored. On May 14, 2020, Maine CDC began enrolling contacts of patients with reported COVID-19 into Sara Alert (MITRE Corporation, 2020),* an automated, web-based, symptom monitoring tool. After initial communication with Maine CDC staff members, enrolled contacts automatically received daily symptom questionnaires via their choice of e-mailed weblink, text message, texted weblink, or telephone call until completion of their quarantine. Epidemiologic investigations were conducted for enrollees who reported symptoms or received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. During May 14-June 26, Maine CDC enrolled 1,622 contacts of 614 COVID-19 patients; 190 (11.7%) eventually developed COVID-19, highlighting the importance of identifying, quarantining, and monitoring contacts of COVID-19 patients to limit spread. In Maine, symptom monitoring was not feasible without the use of an automated symptom monitoring tool. Using a tool that permitted enrollees to specify a method of symptom monitoring was well received, because the majority of persons monitored (96.4%) agreed to report using this system.","Krueger, Gunn, Watson, Smith, Lincoln, Huston, Dirlikov, Robinson","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6931e2","20200807","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Automation; Child; Child, Preschool; Contact Tracing; Coronavirus Infections; Epidemiological Monitoring; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Maine; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Program Evaluation; Symptom Assessment; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16379,""
"Natural Language Processing for Rapid Response to Emergent Diseases: Case Study of Calcium Channel Blockers and Hypertension in the COVID-19 Pandemic","A novel disease poses special challenges for informatics solutions. Biomedical informatics relies for the most part on structured data, which require a preexisting data or knowledge model; however, novel diseases do not have preexisting knowledge models. In an emergent epidemic, language processing can enable rapid conversion of unstructured text to a novel knowledge model. However, although this idea has often been suggested, no opportunity has arisen to actually test it in real time. The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents such an opportunity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the added value of information from clinical text in response to emergent diseases using natural language processing (NLP). We explored the effects of long-term treatment by calcium channel blockers on the outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients with high blood pressure during in-patient hospital stays using two sources of information: data available strictly from structured electronic health records (EHRs) and data available through structured EHRs and text mining. In this multicenter study involving 39 hospitals, text mining increased the statistical power sufficiently to change a negative result for an adjusted hazard ratio to a positive one. Compared to the baseline structured data, the number of patients available for inclusion in the study increased by 2.95 times, the amount of available information on medications increased by 7.2 times, and the amount of additional phenotypic information increased by 11.9 times. In our study, use of calcium channel blockers was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. This finding was obtained by quickly adapting an NLP pipeline to the domain of the novel disease; the adapted pipeline still performed sufficiently to extract useful information. When that information was used to supplement existing structured data, the sample size could be increased sufficiently to see treatment effects that were not previously statistically detectable.","Neuraz, Lerner, Digan, Paris, Tsopra, Rogier, Baudoin, Cohen, Burgun, Garcelon, Rance, Ancel, Bauchet, Beeker, Benoit, Bernaux, Bellamine, Bey, Bourmaud, Breant, Burgun, Carrat, Caucheteux, Champ, Cormont, Daniel, Dubiel, Duclos, Esteve, Frank, Garcelon, Gramfort, Griffon, Grisel, Guilbaud, Hassen-Khodja, Hemery, Hilka, Jannot, Lambert, Layese, Leblanc, Lebouter, Lemaitre, Leprovost, Lerner, Sallah, Maire, Mamzer, Martel, Mensch, Moreau, Neuraz, Orlova, Paris, Rance, Ravera, Rozes, Salamanca, Sandrin, Serre, Tannier, Treluyer, van Gysel, Varoquaux, Jen Vie, Wack, Wajsburt, Wassermann, Zapletal","https://doi.org/10.2196/20773","20200821","COVID-19; electronic health records; emergent disease; informatics; medication information; natural language processing; public health; response; Betacoronavirus; Calcium Channel Blockers; Coronavirus Infections; Data Mining; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Hypertension; Natural Language Processing; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Time Factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16380,""
"Semantic Deep Learning: Prior Knowledge and a Type of Four-Term Embedding Analogy to Acquire Treatments for Well-Known Diseases","How to treat a disease remains to be the most common type of clinical question. Obtaining evidence-based answers from biomedical literature is difficult. Analogical reasoning with embeddings from deep learning (embedding analogies) may extract such biomedical facts, although the state-of-the-art focuses on pair-based proportional (pairwise) analogies such as man:woman::king:queen (&quot;queen = -man +king +woman&quot;). This study aimed to systematically extract disease treatment statements with a Semantic Deep Learning (SemDeep) approach underpinned by prior knowledge and another type of 4-term analogy (other than pairwise). As preliminaries, we investigated Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) embedding analogies in a common-English corpus with five lines of text and observed a type of 4-term analogy (not pairwise) applying the 3CosAdd formula and relating the semantic fields person and death: &quot;dagger = -Romeo +die +died&quot; (search query: -Romeo +die +died). Our SemDeep approach worked with pre-existing items of knowledge (what is known) to make inferences sanctioned by a 4-term analogy (search query -x +z1 +z2) from CBOW and Skip-gram embeddings created with a PubMed systematic reviews subset (PMSB dataset). Stage1: Knowledge acquisition. Obtaining a set of terms, candidate y, from embeddings using vector arithmetic. Some n-gram pairs from the cosine and validated with evidence (prior knowledge) are the input for the 3cosAdd, seeking a type of 4-term analogy relating the semantic fields disease and treatment. Stage 2: Knowledge organization. Identification of candidates sanctioned by the analogy belonging to the semantic field treatment and mapping these candidates to unified medical language system Metathesaurus concepts with MetaMap. A concept pair is a brief disease treatment statement (biomedical fact). Stage 3: Knowledge validation. An evidence-based evaluation followed by human validation of biomedical facts potentially useful for clinicians. We obtained 5352 n-gram pairs from 446 search queries by applying the 3CosAdd. The microaveraging performance of MetaMap for candidate y belonging to the semantic field treatment was F-measure=80.00% (precision=77.00%, recall=83.25%). We developed an empirical heuristic with some predictive power for clinical winners, that is, search queries bringing candidate y with evidence of a therapeutic intent for target disease x. The search queries -asthma +inhaled_corticosteroids +inhaled_corticosteroid and -epilepsy +valproate +antiepileptic_drug were clinical winners, finding eight evidence-based beneficial treatments. Extracting treatments with therapeutic intent by analogical reasoning from embeddings (423K n-grams from the PMSB dataset) is an ambitious goal. Our SemDeep approach is knowledge-based, underpinned by embedding analogies that exploit prior knowledge. Biomedical facts from embedding analogies (4-term type, not pairwise) are potentially useful for clinicians. The heuristic offers a practical way to discover beneficial treatments for well-known diseases. Learning from deep learning models does not require a massive amount of data. Embedding analogies are not limited to pairwise analogies; hence, analogical reasoning with embeddings is underexploited.","Arguello Casteleiro, Des Diz, Maroto, Fernandez Prieto, Peters, Wroe, Sevillano Torrado, Maseda Fernandez, Stevens","https://doi.org/10.2196/16948","20200928","PubMed; analogical reasoning; artificial intelligence; deep learning; embedding analogies; evidence-based practice; semantic deep learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16381,""
"Imaging of COVID-19 pneumonia: Patterns, pathogenesis, and advances","COVID-19 pneumonia is a newly recognized lung infection. Initially, CT imaging was demonstrated to be one of the most sensitive tests for the detection of infection. Currently, with broader availability of polymerase chain reaction for disease diagnosis, CT is mainly used for the identification of complications and other defined clinical indications in hospitalized patients. Nonetheless, radiologists are interpreting lung imaging in unsuspected patients as well as in suspected patients with imaging obtained to rule out other relevant clinical indications. The knowledge of pathological findings is also crucial for imagers to better interpret various imaging findings. Identification of the imaging findings that are commonly seen with the disease is important to diagnose and suggest confirmatory testing in unsuspected cases. Proper precautionary measures will be important in such unsuspected patients to prevent further spread. In addition to understanding the imaging findings for the diagnosis of the disease, it is important to understand the growing set of tools provided by artificial intelligence. The goal of this review is to highlight common imaging findings using illustrative examples, describe the evolution of disease over time, discuss differences in imaging appearance of adult and pediatric patients and review the available literature on quantitative CT for COVID-19. We briefly address the known pathological findings of the COVID-19 lung disease that may help better understand the imaging appearance, and we provide a demonstration of novel display methodologies and artificial intelligence applications serving to support clinical observations.","Nagpal, Narayanasamy, Vidholia, Guo, Shin, Lee, Hoffman","https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20200538","20200901","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Lung; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16382,""
"Natural Language Processing to Ascertain Cancer Outcomes From Medical Oncologist Notes","Cancer research using electronic health records and genomic data sets requires clinical outcomes data, which may be recorded only in unstructured text by treating oncologists. Natural language processing (NLP) could substantially accelerate extraction of this information. Patients with lung cancer who had tumor sequencing as part of a single-institution precision oncology study from 2013 to 2018 were identified. Medical oncologists' progress notes for these patients were reviewed. For each note, curators recorded whether the assessment/plan indicated any cancer, progression/worsening of disease, and/or response to therapy or improving disease. Next, a recurrent neural network was trained using unlabeled notes to extract the assessment/plan from each note. Finally, convolutional neural networks were trained on labeled assessments/plans to predict the probability that each curated outcome was present. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) among a held-out test set of 10% of patients. Associations between curated response or progression end points and overall survival were measured using Cox models among patients receiving palliative-intent systemic therapy. Medical oncologist notes (n = 7,597) were manually curated for 919 patients. In the 10% test set, NLP models replicated human curation with AUROCs of 0.94 for the any-cancer outcome, 0.86 for the progression outcome, and 0.90 for the response outcome. Progression/worsening events identified using NLP models were associated with shortened survival (hazard ratio [HR] for mortality, 2.49; 95% CI, 2.00 to 3.09); response/improvement events were associated with improved survival (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.67). NLP models based on neural networks can extract meaningful outcomes from oncologist notes at scale. Such models may facilitate identification of clinical and genomic features associated with response to cancer treatment.","Kehl, Xu, Lepisto, Elmarakeby, Hassett, Van Allen, Johnson, Schrag","https://doi.org/10.1200/CCI.20.00020","20200924","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16383,""
"A Systematic Review of IoT Solutions for Smart Farming","The world population growth is increasing the demand for food production. Furthermore, the reduction of the workforce in rural areas and the increase in production costs are challenges for food production nowadays. Smart farming is a farm management concept that may use Internet of Things (IoT) to overcome the current challenges of food production. This work uses the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews (PRISMA) methodology to systematically review the existing literature on smart farming with IoT. The review aims to identify the main devices, platforms, network protocols, processing data technologies and the applicability of smart farming with IoT to agriculture. The review shows an evolution in the way data is processed in recent years. Traditional approaches mostly used data in a reactive manner. In more recent approaches, however, new technological developments allowed the use of data to prevent crop problems and to improve the accuracy of crop diagnosis.","Navarro, Costa, Pereira","https://doi.org/10.3390/s20154231","20200825","IoT technologies; artificial intelligence; big data; cloud computing; smart farming","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16384,""
"Towards User-friendly Wearable Platforms for Monitoring Unconstrained Indoor and Outdoor Activities","Developing wearable platforms for unconstrained monitoring of limb movements has been an active recent topic of research due to potential applications such as clinical and athletic performance evaluation. However, practicality of these platforms might be affected by the dynamic and complexity of movements as well as characteristics of the surrounding environment. This paper addresses such issues by proposing a novel method for obtaining kinematic information of joints using a custom-designed wearable platform. The proposed method uses data from two gyroscopes and an array of textile stretch sensors to accurately track three-dimensional movements, including extension, flexion, and rotation, of a joint. More specifically, gyroscopes provide angular velocity data of two sides of a joint, while their relative orientation is estimated by a machine learning algorithm. An unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm is applied to directly fuse angular velocity/relative orientation data and estimate the kinematic orientation of the joint. Experimental evaluations were carried out using data from 10 volunteers performing a series of predefined as well as unconstrained random three-dimensional trunk movements. Results show that the proposed sensor setup and the UKF-based data fusion algorithm can accurately estimate the orientation of the trunk relative to pelvis with an average error of less than 1.72 degrees in predefined movements and a comparable accuracy of 3.00 degrees in random movements. Moreover, the proposed platform is easy to setup, does not restrict body motion, and is not affected by environmental disturbances. This study is a further step towards developing user-friendly wearable sensor systems than can be readily used in indoor and outdoor settings without requiring bulky equipment or a tedious calibration phase.","Rezaei, Khoshnam, Menon","https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.3004319","20200917","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16385,""
"Single Volume Image Generator and Deep Learning-based ASD Classification","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an intricate neuropsychiatric brain disorder characterized by social deficits and repetitive behaviors. Deep learning approaches have been applied in clinical or behavioral identification of ASD; most erstwhile models are inadequate in their capacity to exploit the data richness. On the other hand, classification techniques often solely rely on region-based summary and/or functional connectivity analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Besides, biomedical data modeling to analyze big data related to ASD is still perplexing due to its complexity and heterogeneity. Single volume image consideration has not been previously investigated in classification purposes. By deeming these challenges, in this work, firstly, we design an image generator to generate single volume brain images from the whole-brain image by considering the voxel time point of each subject separately. Then, to classify ASD and typical control participants, we evaluate four deep learning approaches with their corresponding ensemble classifiers comprising one amended Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, to check out the data variability, we apply the proposed CNN classifier with leave-one-site-out 5-fold cross-validation across the sites and validate our findings by comparing with literature reports. We showcase our approach on large-scale multi-site brain imaging dataset (ABIDE) by considering four preprocessing pipelines, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Hence, it is robust and consistent.","Ahmed, Zhang, Liu, Liao","https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.2998603","20200805","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16386,""
"Automatic Medical Code Assignment via Deep Learning Approach for Intelligent Healthcare","With the development of healthcare 4.0, there has been an explosion in the amount of data such as image, medical text, physiological signals, lab tests, etc. Among them, medical records provide a complete picture of the associated clinical events. However, the processing of medical texts is difficult because they are structurally free, diverse in style, and have subjective factors. Assigning metadata codes from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) presents a standardized way of indicating diagnoses and procedures, so it becomes a mandatory process for understanding medical records to make better clinical and financial decisions. Such a manual encoding task is time-consuming, error-prone and expensive. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning approach and a medical topic mining method to automatically predict ICD codes from text-free medical records. The result of the F1 score on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset increases by 5% over the state of art. It also suitable for multiple ICD versions and languages. For the specific disease, atrial fibrillation, the F1 score is up to 96% and 93.3% using in-house ICD-10 datasets and MIMIC-III datasets, respectively. We developed an Artificial Intelligence based coding system, which can greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of human coders, and meanwhile accelerate the secondary use for clinical informatics.","Teng, Ma, Chen, Xiao, Huang","https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.2996937","20200904","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16387,""
"A Guide to Performance Evaluation for the Intensivist: Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation and Focused Professional Practice Evaluation in the ICU","In 2008, The Joint Commission implemented a new standard mandating a detailed evaluation of a provider's performance. The Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation was designed to provide ongoing performance evaluation as opposed to periodic evaluation. The Focused Professional Practice Evaluation was designed to evaluate the performance of providers new to the medical staff or providers who are requesting new privileges. To date, we are unable to find critical care specific literature on the implementation of Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation/Focused Professional Practice Evaluation. The purpose of this concise definitive review is to familiarize the reader with The Joint Commission standards and their application to Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation/Focused Professional Practice Evaluation design and implementation, literature review in the noncritical care setting, and future process optimization and automation. Studies were identified through MEDLINE search using a variety of search phrases related to Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation, Focused Professional Practice Evaluation, critical care medicine, healthcare quality, and The Joint Commission. Additional articles were identified through a review of the reference lists of identified articles. Original articles, review articles, and systematic reviews were considered. Manuscripts were selected for inclusion based on expert opinion of well-designed or key studies and review articles. There is limited data for the process of Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation and Focused Professional Practice Evaluation implementation in critical care medicine. Key recommendations exist from The Joint Commission but leave it up to healthcare institutions to realize these. The process and metrics can be tailored to specific institutions and departments. Currently, there is no standard process to develop Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation and Focused Professional Practice Evaluation processes in critical care medicine. Departments and institutions can tailor metrics and processes but it might be useful to standardize some metrics to assure the overall quality of care. In the future utilization of newer technologies like applications might make this process less time-intensive.","Sterling, Gregg, Bakshi, Moll","https://doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0000000000004441","20200915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16388,""
"Usability Methods and Attributes Reported in Usability Studies of Mobile Apps for Health Care Education: Protocol for a Scoping Review","E-learning technologies, including mobile apps, are used to a large extent in health care education. Mobile apps can provide extendable learning environments and motivate students for adaptive and collaborative learning outside the classroom context. Developers should design practical, effective, and easy-to-use mobile apps. Usability testing is an important part of app development in order to understand if apps meet the needs of users. The aim of this study is to perform a scoping review of usability methods and attributes reported in usability studies of mobile apps for health care education. The scoping review is guided by the methodological framework developed by Arksey &amp; O'Malley and further developed by Levac et al and Kahlil et al. The stages we will follow are as follows: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) selecting studies; (4) charting the data; and (5) summarizing and reporting the results. We have developed two research questions to meet the aim of the study, which are as follows: (1) What usability methods are used to evaluate the usability of mobile apps for health care education? and (2) What usability attributes are reported in the usability studies of mobile apps for health care education? We will apply a comprehensive search of the literature, including 10 databases, a reference search, and a search for grey literature. Two review authors will independently screen articles for eligibility. The initial electronic database searches were completed in March 2019. The literature search identified 14,297 unique references. Following title and abstract screening, the full texts of 369 records were obtained. The scoping review is expected to be completed in spring 2021. We expect the overview of usability methods and attributes reported in usability studies of mobile apps for health care education to contribute to the knowledge base for researchers and developers. It will give an overview of the research field and provide researchers and developers with relevant and important information on the usability research area, including highlighting possible research gaps.

"Cardiopulmonary exercise testing - refining the clinical perspective by combining assessments","Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is now established as a vital sign. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) is the gold-standard approach to assessing CRF. A body of literature spanning several decades clearly supports the clinical utility of CPX in those who are apparently health and at risk for chronic disease as well as numerous patient populations. While CPX, in and of itself, is a valid and reliable clinical assessment, combining findings with other available assessments may provide a more comprehensive perspective that enhances clinical decision making and outcomes. The current review will accomplish the following: (1) define key CPX measures based upon current evidence; and (2) describe the current evidence addressing the relationships between CPX and echocardiography, serum biomarkers, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing provides prognostic and diagnostic information in apparently healthy individuals, those at risk for one or more chronic conditions, as well as numerous patient populations. Moreover, if the goal of an intervention is to improve one or more systems integral to the physiologic response to exercise, CPX should be considered as a central assessment to gauge therapeutic efficacy. To further refine the information obtained from CPX, combining other assessments has demonstrated promise.","Arena, Canada, Popovic, Trankle, Del Buono, Lucas, Abbate","https://doi.org/10.1080/14779072.2020.1806057","20201005","Exercise testing; biomarkers; cardiovascular imaging; echocardiography; magnetic resonance; oxygen consumption; ventilatory efficiency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16390,""
"Embedding graduate attributes during occupational therapy curriculum development: A scoping review and qualitative research synthesis","Graduate attributes are the personal qualities, skills and competencies, and values that students develop during their time at university to prepare them for work, and enable them to contribute to their communities. Occupational therapy education may foster well-rounded individuals if the development of graduate attributes is embedded within curriculum design and delivery. This study identifies and synthesises existing knowledge on how graduate attributes are embedded in occupational therapy curricula. We conducted a scoping review following PRISMA extension for scoping review guidelines, and a qualitative research synthesis to reach a new conceptual understanding of the process of developing desired graduate attributes during occupational therapy curriculum development. Ten discipline-specific occupational therapy graduate attributes were identified. Three themes from the analysis of 15 papers explained how these attributes are embedded in curricula: Using a theoretical framework, a Graded process of active learning, and Collaborative curriculum design. Occupational therapy education is enhanced by being explicit about the desired graduate attributes that underpin curriculum design and delivery. Further work is needed to understand the benefits of including service users' perspectives and the value of clinical fieldwork education.","Plastow, Bester","https://doi.org/10.1111/1440-1630.12689","20201023","curriculum; professional education related; occupational therapy; occupational therapy education; practice area; qualitative evaluation; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16391,""
"[Computer-assisted skin cancer diagnosis : Is it time for artificial intelligence in clinical practice?]","Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in medical practice. Especially in the image-based diagnosis of skin cancer, AI shows great potential. However, there is aÃ‚Â significant discrepancy between expectations and true relevance of AI in current dermatological practice. This article summarizes promising study results of skin cancer diagnosis by computer-based diagnostic systems and discusses their significance for daily practice. We hereby focus on the analysis of dermoscopic images of pigmented and unpigmented skin lesions. AÃ‚Â selective literature search for recent relevant trials was conducted. The included studies used machine learning, and in particular &quot;convolutional neural networks&quot;, which have been shown to be particularly effective for the classification of image data. In numerous studies, computer algorithms were able to detect pigmented and nonpigmented neoplasms of the skin with high precision, comparable to that of dermatologists. The combination of the physician's assessment and AI showed the best results. Computer-based diagnostic systems are widely accepted among patients and physicians. However, they are still not applicable in daily practice, since computer-based diagnostic systems have only been tested in an experimental environment. In addition, many digital diagnostic criteria that help AI to classify skin lesions remain unclear. This lack of transparency still needs to be addressed. Moreover, clinical studies on the use of AI-based assistance systems are needed in order to prove its applicability in daily dermatologic practice.","Brinker, Schlager, French, Jutzi, Kittler","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00105-020-04662-8","20200910","Computer algorithms; Computer-assisted diagnosis; Dermoscopy; Machine learning; Suspicious lesions; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Dermoscopy; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Mass Screening; Melanoma; Neural Networks, Computer; Skin Neoplasms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16392,""

"Dreem Open Datasets: Multi-Scored Sleep Datasets to Compare Human and Automated Sleep Staging","Sleep stage classification constitutes an important element of sleep disorder diagnosis. It relies on the visual inspection of polysomnography records by trained sleep technologists. Automated approaches have been designed to alleviate this resource-intensive task. However, such approaches are usually compared to a single human scorer annotation despite an inter-rater agreement of about 85% only. The present study introduces two publicly-available datasets, DOD-H including 25 healthy volunteers and DOD-O including 55 patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Both datasets have been scored by 5 sleep technologists from different sleep centers. We developed a framework to compare automated approaches to a consensus of multiple human scorers. Using this framework, we benchmarked and compared the main literature approaches to a new deep learning method, SimpleSleepNet, which reach state-of-the-art performances while being more lightweight. We demonstrated that many methods can reach human-level performance on both datasets. SimpleSleepNet achieved an F1 of 89.9% vs 86.8% on average for human scorers on DOD-H, and an F1 of 88.3% vs 84.8% on DOD-O.

"COPD phenotypes and machine learning cluster analysis: A systematic review and future research agenda","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a highly heterogeneous condition projected to become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030. To better characterize this condition, clinicians have classified patients sharing certain symptomatic characteristics, such as symptom intensity and history of exacerbations, into distinct phenotypes. In recent years, the growing use of machine learning algorithms, and cluster analysis in particular, has promised to advance this classification through the integration of additional patient characteristics, including comorbidities, biomarkers, and genomic information. This combination would allow researchers to more reliably identify new COPD phenotypes, as well as better characterize existing ones, with the aim of improving diagnosis and developing novel treatments. Here, we systematically review the last decade of research progress, which uses cluster analysis to identify COPD phenotypes.

"Promoting health-related cardiorespiratory fitness in physical education: A systematic review","This article aimed to systematically review the contribution of physical education (PE) classes to improve cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in children and adolescents; and to define potentially relevant factors for promoting CRF in PE classes. Studies were identified from searches in ERIC, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science databases. Primary source articles, relating PE classes and CRF, published up to July 2019 in peer-reviewed journals were eligible for inclusion. Specific inclusion criteria were: (a) having cross-sectional or longitudinal and observational or interventional study designs; (b) targeting school-aged children or adolescents; (c) measuring CRF, heart rate or CRF test results as an outcome; (d) having statistical analyses of the CRF, heart rate or CRF test results outcomes reported; (e) focusing on PE classes or PE interventions that did not extended time or frequency of the classes; and (f) published in English, French, Portuguese, or Spanish. A total of 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 10 studies have found a neutral effect of PE classes in students' CRF, eight studies found that PE indeed contributed to the improvement of CRF and six studies revealed mixed findings, when PE classes where controlled for others variables (e.g. body mass index, intensity). Higher intensity PE classes consistently demonstrated contributions to improving students' CRF. Review findings suggest that PE classes can contribute to the improvement of students' CRF. Intensity, age and weight status were identified as potentially relevant factors for promoting CRF in PE classes. To improve CRF, higher intensity classes should be provided.","Peralta, Henriques-Neto, Gouveia, Sardinha, Marques","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237019","20201013","Adolescent; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Physical Education and Training; Physical Fitness; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16396,""

We meta-analyze 54 studies (<i>n</i> = 116,010) examining associations of ELA with pubertal timing and cellular aging (telomere length and DNA methylation age), systematically review 25 studies (<i>n</i> = 3,253) examining ELA and neural markers of accelerated development (cortical thickness and amygdala-prefrontal cortex functional connectivity) and evaluate whether associations of ELA with biological aging vary according to the nature of adversity experienced. ELA overall was associated with accelerated pubertal timing (<i>d</i> = -0.10) and cellular aging (<i>d</i> = -0.21), but these associations varied by adversity type. Moderator analysis revealed that ELA characterized by threat was associated with accelerated pubertal development (<i>d</i> = -0.26) and accelerated cellular aging (<i>d</i> = -0.43), but deprivation and SES were unrelated to accelerated development. Systematic review revealed associations between ELA and accelerated cortical thinning, with threat-related ELA consistently associated with thinning in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and deprivation and SES associated with thinning in frontoparietal, default, and visual networks. There was no consistent association of ELA with amygdala-PFC connectivity. These findings suggest specificity in the types of early environmental experiences associated with accelerated biological aging and highlight the importance of evaluating how accelerated aging contributes to health disparities and whether this process can be mitigated through early intervention.

"Diabetic Foot Surveillance Using Mobile Phones and Automated Software Messaging, a Randomized Observational Trial","Early detection of diabetic foot ulcers can improve outcomes. However, patients do not always monitor their feet or seek medical attention when ulcers worsen. New approaches for diabetic-foot surveillance are needed. The goal of this study was to determine if patients would be willing and able to regularly photograph their feet; evaluate different foot-imaging approaches; and determine clinical adequacy of the resulting pictures. We recruited adults with diabetes and assigned them to Self Photo (SP), Assistive Device (AD), or Other Party (OP) groups. The SP group photographed their own feet, while the AD group used a selfie stick; the OP group required another adult to photograph the patient's foot. For 8 weeks, we texted all patients requesting that they text us a photo of each foot. The collected images were evaluated for clinical adequacy. Numbers of (i) submitted and (ii) clinically useful images were compared among groups using generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed models. A total of 96 patients consented and 88 participated. There were 30 patients in SP, 29 in AD, and 29 in OP. The completion rate was 77%, with no significant differences among groups. However, 74.1% of photographs in SC, 83.7% in AD, 92.6% in OP were determined to be clinically adequate, and these differed statistically significantly. Patients with diabetes are willing and able to take photographs of their feet, but using selfie sticks or having another adult take the photographs increases the clinical adequacy of the photographs.<b>Level of Evidence: II</b>.","Anthony, Femino, Miller, Polgreen, Rojas, Francis, Segre, Polgreen","https://www.google.com/search?q=Diabetic+Foot+Surveillance+Using+Mobile+Phones+and+Automated+Software+Messaging,+a+Randomized+Observational+Trial.","20200904","SMS; foot ulcer; m-health; photograph; remote monitoring; texting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16398,""
"Cost utility of a pharmacist-led minor ailment service compared with usual pharmacist care","A cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) performed from July 2018 to March 2019 demonstrated the clinical impact of a community pharmacist delivered minor ailment service (MAS) compared with usual pharmacist care (UC).Ã‚Â MAS consisted of a technology-based face-to-face consultation delivered by trained community pharmacists. The consultation was guided by clinical pathways for assessment and management, and communication systems, collaboratively agreed with general practitioners. MAS pharmacists were trained and provided monthly practice support by a practice change facilitator. The objective of this study was to assess the cost utility of MAS, compared to UC. Participants recruited were adult patients with symptoms suggestive of a minor ailment condition, from community pharmacies located in Western Sydney. Patients received MAS (intervention) or UC (control) and were followed-up by telephone 14-days following consultation with the pharmacist. A cost utility analysis was conducted alongside the cRCT. Transition probabilities and costs were directly derived from cRCT study data. Utility values were not available from the cRCT, hence we relied on utility values reported in the published literature which were used to calculate quality adjusted life years (QALYs), using the area under the curve method. A decision tree model was used to capture the decision problem, considering a societal perspective and a 14-day time horizon. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed robustness and uncertainty of results, respectively. Patients (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°894) were recruited from 30 pharmacies and 82% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°732) responded to follow-up. On average, MAS was more costly but also more effective (in terms of symptom resolution and QALY gains) compared to UC. MAS patients (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°524) gained an additional 0.003 QALYs at an incremental cost of $7.14 (Australian dollars), compared to UC (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°370) which resulted in an ICER of $2277 (95% CI $681.49-3811.22) per QALY. Economic findings suggest that implementation of MAS within the Australian context is cost effective.<i>Trial registration</i> Registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) and allocated the ACTRN: ACTRN12618000286246.

"Technical Description and Microsurgical Outcomes in Phalloplasty Using the Deep Inferior Epigastric Artery and Locoregional Veins","Phalloplasty often requires free tissue transfer. There is ample literature describing flap-related outcomes, but the microsurgical technique used, including choice of recipient vessels, has been an overlooked yet important topic. In this study, the authors review the outcomes of their experience with the deep inferior epigastric artery and locoregional veins and outline technical modifications that occurred during the study period. A retrospective chart analysis of patients who underwent microsurgical phalloplasty between September of 2016 and July of 2019 was performed. Variables included flap design, donor site, and recipient vessels. The outcome measures were return to the operating room for flap compromise and partial or complete flap loss. Forty-two phalloplasties using the deep inferior epigastric artery were identified. There were six take-backs for flap compromise, and four patients required venous revision, one of whom lost his urethral flap on postoperative day 9. There was a decrease in take-back rate from 30 percent in the first 20 patients to 0 percent in the second 22 patients in the study period. A total of 11.9 percent of patients had partial flap loss. This decreased from 15 percent to 9 percent in the two groups. After an initial learning curve, the combination of deep inferior epigastric artery, deep inferior epigastric vein, and great saphenous vein combined with specific technical modifications such as targeted coagulation of the vasa nervorum of the clitoral nerve has proven to be a reliable technique.

"Does Artificial Intelligence Outperform Natural Intelligence in Interpreting Musculoskeletal Radiological Studies? A Systematic Review","Machine learning (ML) is a subdomain of artificial intelligence that enables computers to abstract patterns from data without explicit programming. A myriad of impactful ML applications already exists in orthopaedics ranging from predicting infections after surgery to diagnostic imaging. However, no systematic reviews that we know of have compared, in particular, the performance of ML models with that of clinicians in musculoskeletal imaging to provide an up-to-date summary regarding the extent of applying ML to imaging diagnoses. By doing so, this review delves into where current ML developments stand in aiding orthopaedists in assessing musculoskeletal images. This systematic review aimed (1) to compare performance of ML models versus clinicians in detecting, differentiating, or classifying orthopaedic abnormalities on imaging by (A) accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, (B) input features (for example, plain radiographs, MRI scans, ultrasound), (C) clinician specialties, and (2) to compare the performance of clinician-aided versus unaided ML models. A systematic review was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published up to October 1, 2019, using synonyms for machine learning and all potential orthopaedic specialties. We included all studies that compared ML models head-to-head against clinicians in the binary detection of abnormalities in musculoskeletal images. After screening 6531 studies, we ultimately included 12 studies. We conducted quality assessment using the Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) checklist. All 12 studies were of comparable quality, and they all clearly included six of the eight critical appraisal items (study aim, input feature, ground truth, ML versus human comparison, performance metric, and ML model description). This justified summarizing the findings in a quantitative form by calculating the median absolute improvement of the ML models compared with clinicians for the following metrics of performance: accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. ML models provided, in aggregate, only very slight improvements in diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity compared with clinicians working alone and were on par in specificity (3% (interquartile range [IQR] -2.0% to 7.5%), 0.06% (IQR -0.03 to 0.14), and 0.00 (IQR -0.048 to 0.048), respectively). Inputs used by the ML models were plain radiographs (n = 8), MRI scans (n = 3), and ultrasound examinations (n = 1). Overall, ML models outperformed clinicians more when interpreting plain radiographs than when interpreting MRIs (17 of 34 and 3 of 16 performance comparisons, respectively). Orthopaedists and radiologists performed similarly to ML models, while ML models mostly outperformed other clinicians (outperformance in 7 of 19, 7 of 23, and 6 of 10 performance comparisons, respectively). Two studies evaluated the performance of clinicians aided and unaided by ML models; both demonstrated considerable improvements in ML-aided clinician performance by reporting a 47% decrease of misinterpretation rate (95% confidence interval [CI] 37 to 54; p &lt; 0.001) and a mean increase in specificity of 0.048 (95% CI 0.029 to 0.068; p &lt; 0.001) in detecting abnormalities on musculoskeletal images. At present, ML models have comparable performance to clinicians in assessing musculoskeletal images. ML models may enhance the performance of clinicians as a technical supplement rather than as a replacement for clinical intelligence. Future ML-related studies should emphasize how ML models can complement clinicians, instead of determining the overall superiority of one versus the other. This can be accomplished by improving transparent reporting, diminishing bias, determining the feasibility of implantation in the clinical setting, and appropriately tempering conclusions.

"Unbiased identification of novel subclinical imaging biomarkers using unsupervised deep learning","Artificial intelligence has recently made a disruptive impact in medical imaging by successfully automatizing expert-level diagnostic tasks. However, replicating human-made decisions may inherently be biased by the fallible and dogmatic nature of human experts, in addition to requiring prohibitive amounts of training data. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised deep learning architecture particularly designed for OCT representations for unbiased, purely data-driven biomarker discovery. We developed artificial intelligence technology that provides biomarker candidates without any restricting input or domain knowledge beyond raw images. Analyzing 54,900 retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) volume scans of 1094 patients with age-related macular degeneration, we generated a vocabulary of 20 local and global markers capturing characteristic retinal patterns. The resulting markers were validated by linking them with clinical outcomes (visual acuity, lesion activity and retinal morphology) using correlation and machine learning regression. The newly identified features correlated well with specific biomarkers traditionally used in clinical practice (r up to 0.73), and outperformed them in correlating with visual acuity ([Formula: see text] compared to [Formula: see text] for conventional markers), despite representing an enormous compression of OCT imaging data (67 million voxels to 20 features). In addition, our method also discovered hitherto unknown, clinically relevant biomarker candidates. The presented deep learning approach identified known as well as novel medical imaging biomarkers without any prior domain knowledge. Similar approaches may be worthwhile across other medical imaging fields.","Waldstein, SeebÃƒÂ¶ck, Donner, Sadeghipour, BogunoviÃ„â€¡, Osborne, Schmidt-Erfurth","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69814-1","20201027","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16402,""
"Sarcopenia, frailty and cachexia patients detected in a multisystem electronic health record database","Sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty have overlapping features and clinical consequences, but often go unrecognized. The objective was to detect patients described by clinicians as having sarcopenia, cachexia or frailty within electronic health records (EHR) and compare clinical variables between cases and matched controls. We conducted a case-control study using retrospective data from the Indiana Network for Patient Care multi-health system database from 2016 to 2017. The computable phenotype combined ICD codes for sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty, with clinical note text terms for sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty detected using natural language processing. Cases with these codes or text terms were matched to controls without these codes or text terms matched on birth year, sex and race. Two physicians reviewed EHR for all cases and a subset of controls. Comorbidity codes, laboratory values, and other coded clinical variables were compared between groups using Wilcoxon matched-pair sign-rank test for continuous variables and conditional logistic regression for binary variables. Cohorts of 9594 cases and 9594 matched controls were generated. Cases were 59% female, 69% white, and a median (1st, 3rd quartiles) age 74.9 (62.2, 84.8) years. Most cases were detected by text terms without ICD codes nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°8285 (86.4%). All cases detected by ICD codes (total nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°1309) also had supportive text terms. Overall 1496 (15.6%) had concurrent terms or codes for two or more of the three conditions (sarcopenia, cachexia or frailty). Of text term occurrence, 97% were used positively for sarcopenia, 90% for cachexia, and 95% for frailty. The remaining occurrences were negative uses of the terms or applied to someone other than the patient. Cases had lower body mass index, albumin and prealbumin, and significantly higher odds ratios for diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, malignancy, osteoporosis and fractures (all pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Cases were more likely to be prescribed appetite stimulants and caloric supplements. Patients detected with a computable phenotype for sarcopenia, cachexia and frailty differed from controls in several important clinical variables. Potential uses include detection among clinical cohorts for targeting recruitment for research and interventions.","Moorthi, Liu, El-Azab, Lembcke, Miller, Broyles, Imel","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-020-03522-9","20200806","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16403,""
"Neurostimulation for treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder: an update on neurocircuitry and therapeutic targets","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a widespread and often devastating psychiatric condition. Core symptoms include intrusive and distressing thoughts, heightened reactivity, mood changes, cognitive impairments, and consequent avoidance of trauma-related stimuli. Symptoms of PTSD are often refractory to standard treatments, and neuromodulatory techniques have therefore drawn significant interest among the most treatment-resistant patients. Transcranial magnetic stimulation has demonstrated minimal efficacy, and deep brain stimulation trials are currently ongoing. PTSD is a disorder of neural circuitry; the current understanding includes involvement of the amygdala (basolateral and central nuclei), the prefrontal cortex (ventral medial and dorsolateral regions), and the hippocampus. Neuroimaging and optogenetic studies have improved the understanding of large-scale neural networks and the effects of microcircuitry manipulation, respectively. This review discusses the current PTSD literature and ongoing neurostimulation trials, and it highlights the current understanding of neuronal circuit dysfunction in PTSD. The authors emphasize the anatomical correlations of PTSD's hallmark symptoms, offer another potential deep brain stimulation target for PTSD, and note the need for continued research to identify useful biomarkers for the development of closed-loop therapies. Although there is hope that neuromodulation will become a viable treatment modality for PTSD, this concept remains theoretical, and further research should involve institutional review board-approved controlled prospective clinical studies.","Larkin, McGinnis, Snyder, Storch, Goodman, Viswanathan, Sheth","https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.4.JNS2061","20200731","ACC = anterior cingulate cortex; BLA = basolateral amygdala; CE = central nuclei; DBS = deep brain stimulation; GABAergic = ÃŽÂ³-aminobutyric acidergic; OFC = orbitofrontal cortex; PAG = periaqueductal gray; PCL = PTSD checklist; PFC = prefrontal cortex; PTSD = posttraumatic stress disorder; RDoC = Research Domain Criteria; TMS = transcranial magnetic stimulation; TR-PTSD = treatment-resistant PTSD; closed-loop stimulation; deep brain stimulation; functional neurosurgery; mPFC = medial PFC; posttraumatic stress disorder; transcranial magnetic stimulation; vmPFC = ventral medial PFC","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16404,""
"The Anatomy of the SARS-CoV-2 Biomedical Literature: Introducing the CovidX Network Algorithm for Drug Repurposing Recommendation","Driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the dire need to discover an antiviral drug, we explored the landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 biomedical publications to identify potential treatments. The aims of this study are to identify off-label drugs that may have benefits for the coronavirus disease pandemic, present a novel ranking algorithm called CovidX to recommend existing drugs for potential repurposing, and validate the literature-based outcome with drug knowledge available in clinical trials. To achieve such objectives, we applied natural language processing techniques to identify drugs and linked entities (eg, disease, gene, protein, chemical compounds). When such entities are linked, they form a map that can be further explored using network science tools. The CovidX algorithm was based upon a notion that we called &quot;diversity.&quot; A diversity score for a given drug was calculated by measuring how &quot;diverse&quot; a drug is calculated using various biological entities (regardless of the cardinality of actual instances in each category). The algorithm validates the ranking and awards those drugs that are currently being investigated in open clinical trials. The rationale behind the open clinical trial is to provide a validating mechanism of the PubMed results. This ensures providing up to date evidence of the fast development of this disease. From the analyzed biomedical literature, the algorithm identified 30 possible drug candidates for repurposing, ranked them accordingly, and validated the ranking outcomes against evidence from clinical trials. The top 10 candidates according to our algorithm are hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, chloroquine, ritonavir, losartan, remdesivir, favipiravir, methylprednisolone, rapamycin, and tilorone dihydrochloride. The ranking shows both consistency and promise in identifying drugs that can be repurposed. We believe, however, the full treatment to be a multifaceted, adjuvant approach where multiple drugs may need to be taken at the same time.","Gates, Hamed","https://doi.org/10.2196/21169","20200901","COVID-19; COVID-19 treatment; antiviral; biomedical; drug; drug repurposing; health; informatics; network algorithm; ranking; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16405,""
"Artificial Intelligence in Lung Cancer: Bridging the Gap Between Computational Power and Clinical Decision-Making","Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Recent advances in lung cancer screening, radiotherapy, surgical techniques, and systemic therapy have led to increasing complexity in diagnosis, treatment decision-making, and assessment of recurrence. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction models are being developed to address these issues and may have a future role in screening, diagnosis, treatment selection, and decision-making around salvage therapy. Imaging plays an essential role in all components of lung cancer management and has the potential to play a key role in AI applications. Artificial intelligence has demonstrated value in prognostic biomarker discovery in lung cancer diagnosis, treatment, and response assessment, putting it at the forefront of the next phase of personalized medicine. However, although exploratory studies demonstrate potential utility, there is a need for rigorous validation and standardization before AI can be utilized in clinical decision-making. In this review, we will provide a summary of the current literature implementing AI for outcome prediction in lung cancer. We will describe the anticipated impact of AI on the management of patients with lung cancer and discuss the challenges of clinical implementation of these techniques.","Christie, Lang, Zelko, Palma, Abdelrazek, Mattonen","https://doi.org/10.1177/0846537120941434","20200731","artificial intelligence; lung cancer; machine learning; quantitative imaging; radiomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16406,""
"Asthma Exacerbation Prediction and Risk Factor Analysis Based on a Time-Sensitive, Attentive Neural Network: Retrospective Cohort Study","Asthma exacerbation is an acute or subacute episode of progressive worsening of asthma symptoms and can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. However, efficient methods that can help identify personalized risk factors and make early predictions are lacking. This study aims to use advanced deep learning models to better predict the risk of asthma exacerbations and to explore potential risk factors involved in progressive asthma. We proposed a novel time-sensitive, attentive neural network to predict asthma exacerbation using clinical variables from large electronic health records. The clinical variables were collected from the Cerner Health Facts database between 1992 and 2015, including 31,433 adult patients with asthma. Interpretations on both patient and cohort levels were investigated based on the model parameters. The proposed model obtained an area under the curve value of 0.7003 through a five-fold cross-validation, which outperformed the baseline methods. The results also demonstrated that the addition of elapsed time embeddings considerably improved the prediction performance. Further analysis observed diverse distributions of contributing factors across patients as well as some possible cohort-level risk factors, which could be found supporting evidence from peer-reviewed literature such as respiratory diseases and esophageal reflux. The proposed neural network model performed better than previous methods for the prediction of asthma exacerbation. We believe that personalized risk scores and analyses of contributing factors can help clinicians better assess the individual's level of disease progression and afford the opportunity to adjust treatment, prevent exacerbation, and improve outcomes.","Xiang, Ji, Zhou, Li, Du, Rasmy, Wu, Zheng, Xu, Zhi, Zhang, Tao","https://doi.org/10.2196/16981","20200826","asthma; deep learning; electronic health records; health risk appraisal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16407,""
"Reviews and Thoughts on the Relevance between Qualitative Chinese Medicinal Properties and Quantitative Material Components","Chinese Medicinal Properties (CMP) play a vital role in theoretical research and clinical practice. However, the traditional CMP system is subjective, qualitative, fixed, inconsistent, and obscured. Nowadays, quantifying CMP research achieved a notable progress. This study aims to review and reflect the relevance between qualitative CMP and quantitative material components. A raw literature search was performed firstly in CNKI and Pubmed database to get a rough idea on the general advances in measuring CMP. Then, a strict literature search and data extraction from two dependent research studies were performed to analyze the relevance and discrimination between CMP and material components. The quantitative CMP research mainly focused on the microelements and chemical compositions. The largest microelements research listed 747 Chinese Materia Medica (CMM) (6780 flavors) and 120,000 element data. The measurement of chemical composition of CMM has risen rapidly in the 1990s and continues till the present. Thirty-seven articles were finally identified for the relevance analysis of CMP and material components. Of these, 18 and 19 articles correspondingly focused on the chemical compositions and microelements, and 26 and 11 articles correspondingly focused on their correlation and discrimination relationship. The most commonly used method for correlation analysis is intuitive analysis. The support vector machine maybe highly efficient and would act as the preferred method in discriminant analysis. Twelve (67%) and 5 (26%) articles' data came from the literature search in chemical compositions and microelement research studies. Four studies indicated that the research objects are the basic substances and material basis of CMP, 15 articles claimed that the chemical compositions were significantly related to CMP, 12 research studies concluded that the regularity and causality were identified between the research objects and CMP, and 9 research studies successfully established discriminant models for CMP basing on the detected substances. The relevance research between qualitative CMP and quantitative material components achieved a positive progress, though it is weak and defective. Standardizing the qualitative CMP system, establishing series comprehensive databases for the material components, innovating statistical and data mining methods, and integrating doctors' experiences are important and feasible for future research.","Hou, Hu, Liu, Liang, Huang, Huang","https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8643746","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16408,""
"Prediction of Malignant Acute Middle Cerebral Artery Infarction via Computed Tomography Radiomics","Malignant middle cerebral artery infarction (mMCAi) is a serious complication of cerebral infarction usually associated with poor patient prognosis. In this retrospective study, we analyzed clinical information as well as non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) data from patients with cerebral infarction in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory acquired within 24 h from symptoms onset. Then, we aimed to develop a model based on the radiomics signature to predict the development of mMCAi in cerebral infarction patients. Patients were divided randomly into training (<i>n</i> = 87) and validation (<i>n</i> = 39) sets. A total of 396 texture features were extracted from each NCCT image from the 126 patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis was used to reduce the feature dimension and construct an accurate radiomics signature based on the remaining texture features. Subsequently, we developed a model based on the radiomics signature and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) based on NCCT to predict mMCAi. Our prediction model showed a good predictive performance with an AUC of 0.917 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.863-0.972] and 0.913 [95% CI, 0.795-1] in the training and validation sets, respectively. Additionally, the decision curve analysis (DCA) validated the clinical efficacy of the combined risk factors of radiomics signature and ASPECTS based on NCCT in the prediction of mMCAi development in patients with acute stroke across a wide range of threshold probabilities. Our research indicates that radiomics signature can be an instrumental tool to predict the risk of mMCAi.","Wen, Li, He, Xu, Shu, Hu, Chen, Jiang, Gong","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2020.00708","20200928","computed tomography; malignant; middle cerebral artery; radiomics; stroke; texture analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16409,""

Participants (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 20) were primarily Black/African American and Latino men in Los Angeles with risky substance use. Self-monitoring surveys were sent by text-message twice-weekly for 6 weeks and once-weekly from 6 to 12-weeks. Surveys consisted of 10 questions regarding drug and alcohol use (ie, # days of use) and cravings, quality of life, and medication adherence. Feedback messages praised or encouraged drug use reductions. Coaches monitored patient responses and discussed them in QUIT's telephone coaching sessions. Participants' experiences were assessed qualitatively at 3-month follow-up. Nineteen out of 20 participants that completed the qualitative evaluation from the 12-week follow-up reported: (1) self-monitoring surveys helped them adhere to drug use reduction goals and reflect on associations between self-monitoring domains; (2) preference for higher frequency (twice-weekly) self-monitoring during the 6-week coaching period, and then weekly surveys thereafter but not monthly; and (3) self-monitoring and coaching were mutually reinforcing for their drug use reduction goals.

"Data extraction methods for systematic review (semi)automation: A living review protocol","<b>Background:</b> Researchers in evidence-based medicine cannot keep up with the amounts of both old and newly published primary research articles. Support for the early stages of the systematic review process - searching and screening studies for eligibility - is necessary because it is currently impossible to search for relevant research with precision. Better automated data extraction may not only facilitate the stage of review traditionally labelled 'data extraction', but also change earlier phases of the review process by making it possible to identify relevant research. Exponential improvements in computational processing speed and data storage are fostering the development of data mining models and algorithms. This, in combination with quicker pathways to publication, led to a large landscape of tools and methods for data mining and extraction. <b>Objective:</b> To review published methods and tools for data extraction to (semi)automate the systematic reviewing process. <b>Methods:</b> We propose to conduct a living review. With this methodology we aim to do constant evidence surveillance, bi-monthly search updates, as well as review updates every 6 months if new evidence permits it. In a cross-sectional analysis we will extract methodological characteristics and assess the quality of reporting in our included papers. <b>Conclusions:</b> We aim to increase transparency in the reporting and assessment of automation technologies to the benefit of data scientists, systematic reviewers and funders of health research. This living review will help to reduce duplicate efforts by data scientists who develop data mining methods. It will also serve to inform systematic reviewers about possibilities to support their data extraction.","Schmidt, Olorisade, McGuinness, Thomas, Higgins","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.22781.2","20201022","Data Extraction; Natural Language Processing; Reproducibility; Systematic reviews; Text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16411,""
"Identifying and Predicting Intentional Self-Harm in Electronic Health Record Clinical Notes: Deep Learning Approach","Suicide is an important public health concern in the United States and around the world. There has been significant work examining machine learning approaches to identify and predict intentional self-harm and suicide using existing data sets. With recent advances in computing, deep learning applications in health care are gaining momentum. This study aimed to leverage the information in clinical notes using deep neural networks (DNNs) to (1) improve the identification of patients treated for intentional self-harm and (2) predict future self-harm events. We extracted clinical text notes from electronic health records (EHRs) of 835 patients with International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for intentional self-harm and 1670 matched controls who never had any intentional self-harm ICD codes. The data were divided into training and holdout test sets. We tested a number of algorithms on clinical notes associated with the intentional self-harm codes using the training set, including several traditional bag-of-words-based models and 2 DNN models: a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory model. We also evaluated the predictive performance of the DNNs on a subset of patients who had clinical notes 1 to 6 months before the first intentional self-harm event. Finally, we evaluated the impact of a pretrained model using Word2vec (W2V) on performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the CNN on the phenotyping task, that is, the detection of intentional self-harm in clinical notes concurrent with the events was 0.999, with an F1 score of 0.985. In the predictive task, the CNN achieved the highest performance with an AUC of 0.882 and an F1 score of 0.769. Although pretraining with W2V shortened the DNN training time, it did not improve performance. The strong performance on the first task, namely, phenotyping based on clinical notes, suggests that such models could be used effectively for surveillance of intentional self-harm in clinical text in an EHR. The modest performance on the predictive task notwithstanding, the results using DNN models on clinical text alone are competitive with other reports in the literature using risk factors from structured EHR data.","Obeid, Dahne, Christensen, Howard, Crawford, Frey, Stecker, Bunnell","https://doi.org/10.2196/17784","20200928","deep learning; electronic health records; machine learning; natural language processing; suicide; suicide, attempted","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16412,""
"Analysis on diagnosing diabetic retinopathy by segmenting blood vessels, optic disc and retinal abnormalities","The main intention of mass screening programmes for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is to detect and diagnose the disorder earlier than it leads to vision loss. Automated analysis of retinal images has the likelihood to improve the efficacy of screening programmes when compared over the manual image analysis. This article plans to develop a framework for the detection of DR from the retinal fundus images using three evaluations based on optic disc, blood vessels and retinal abnormalities. Initially, the pre-processing steps like green channel conversion and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalisation is done. Further, the segmentation procedure starts with optic disc segmentation by open-close watershed transform, blood vessel segmentation by grey level thresholding and abnormality segmentation (hard exudates, haemorrhages, Microaneurysm and soft exudates) by top hat transform and Gabor filtering mechanisms. From the three segmented images, the feature like local binary pattern, texture energy measurement, Shanon's and Kapur's entropy are extracted, which is subjected to optimal feature selection process using the new hybrid optimisation algorithm termed as Trial-based Bypass Improved Dragonfly Algorithm (TB - DA). These features are given to hybrid machine learning algorithm with the combination of NN and DBN. As a modification, the same hybrid TB - DA is used to enhance the training of hybrid classifier, which outputs the categorisation as normal, mild, moderate or severe images based on three components.","Jadhav, Patil, Biradar","https://doi.org/10.1080/03091902.2020.1791986","20200910","Diabetic retinopathy detection; blood vessels; optic disc; retinal abnormalities; trial-Based Bypass Improved Dragonfly Algorithm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16413,""
"[Extraction of features from clinical routine data using text mining]","Anti-VEGF drugs are currently used to treat macular diseases. This has led to aÃ‚Â wealth of additional data, which could help understand and predict treatment courses; however, this information is usually only available in free text form. AÃ‚Â retrospective study was designed to analyze how far interpretable information can be obtained from clinical texts by automated extraction. The aim was to assess the suitability of aÃ‚Â text mining method that was customized for this purpose. Data on 3683 patients were available, including 40,485 discharge letters. Some of the data of interest, e.g. visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP) and accompanying diagnoses, were not only recorded textually but also entered in aÃ‚Â database and could thus serve as aÃ‚Â gold standard for text analysis. The text was analyzed using the Averbis Health Discovery text mining platform. To optimize the extraction task, rule knowledge and aÃ‚Â German language technical vocabulary linked to the international medical terminology standard systematized nomenclature of medicine (SNOMED CT) was manually added. The correspondence between extracted data and the structured database entries is described by the F1 value. There was agreement of 94.7% for VA, 98.3% for IOP and 94.7% for the accompanying diagnoses. Manual analysis of noncorresponding cases showed that in 50% text content did not match the database content for various reasons. After an adjustment, F1 values 1-3% above the previously determined values were obtained. Text mining procedures are very well suited for the considered discharge letter corpus and the problem described in order to extract contents from clinical texts in aÃ‚Â structured manner for further evaluation.","Grundel, Bernardeau, Langner, Schmidt, BÃƒÂ¶hringer, Ritter, Rosenthal, Grandjean, Schulz, Daumke, Stahl","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00347-020-01177-4","20200729","Decision support systems; Electronic health records; Macular degeneration; Natural language processing; Systematized nomenclature of medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16414,""
"Effects of Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation on Facial Emotion Recognition in Parkinson's Disease: A Critical Literature Review","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). Nevertheless, DBS has been associated with certain nonmotor, neuropsychiatric effects such as worsening of emotion recognition from facial expressions. In order to investigate facial emotion recognition (FER) after STN DBS, we conducted a literature search of the electronic databases MEDLINE and Web of science. In this review, we analyze studies assessing FER after STN DBS in PD patients and summarize the current knowledge of the effects of STN DBS on FER. The majority of studies, which had clinical and methodological heterogeneity, showed that FER is worsening after STN DBS in PD patients, particularly for negative emotions (sadness, fear, anger, and tendency for disgust). FER worsening after STN DBS can be attributed to the functional role of the STN in limbic circuits and the interference of STN stimulation with neural networks involved in FER, including the connections of the STN with the limbic part of the basal ganglia and pre- and frontal areas. These outcomes improve our understanding of the role of the STN in the integration of motor, cognitive, and emotional aspects of behaviour in the growing field of affective neuroscience. Further studies using standardized neuropsychological measures of FER assessment and including larger cohorts are needed, in order to draw definite conclusions about the effect of STN DBS on emotional recognition and its impact on patients' quality of life.","Kalampokini, Lyros, Lochner, Fassbender, Unger","https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/4329297","20200731","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16415,""
"Herb-drug interactions between the medicinal mushrooms Lingzhi and Yunzhi and cytotoxic anticancer drugs: a systematic review","Lingzhi and Yunzhi are medicinal mushrooms commonly used with cytotoxic chemotherapy in cancer patients in Asian countries. The current systematic review aims to identify potential pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions from the existing literature to ensure their effective and safe combination usage in cancer patients. A systematic search was conducted on nine major Chinese and English databases, including China Journal Net, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and Ovid MEDLINE<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup>, etc., to identify clinical, animal, and in-vitro studies that evaluate the effect of combined use of Lingzhi or Yunzhi with cytotoxic drugs. The Jadad scale was used to assess the quality of clinical studies. This search identified 213 studies, including 77 clinical studies that reported on the combined use of cytotoxic drugs with Yunzhi (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°56) or Lingzhi (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21). Majority of these clinical studies demonstrated modest methodological quality. In clinical practice, the most commonly used cytotoxic drugs with Lingzhi were cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and paclitaxel, whereas Tegafur/uracil (UFT)/Tegafur, 5-FU, and mitomycin were the ones used more often with Yunzhi. Only two clinical pharmacokinetic studies were available showing no significant interactions between Polysaccharide K (PSK) and Tegafur. From the pharmacodynamic interactions perspective, combination uses of Yunzhi/Lingzhi with cytotoxic drugs in clinical practice could lead to improvement in survival (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°31) and quality of life (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°17), reduction in tumor lesions (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22), immune modulation (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°38), and alleviation of chemotherapy-related side effects (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14) with no reported adverse effects. Our findings suggest that the clinical combination use of Lingzhi or Yunzhi with cytotoxic drugs could enhance the efficacy and ameliorate the adverse effects of cytotoxic drugs, leading to improved quality of life in cancer patients. More high quality clinical studies including pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions studies are warranted to verify these observations and mechanisms involved. Based on the high quality clinical data, pharmacoepidemiology methods and bioinformatics or data mining could be adopt for further identification of clinical meaningful herb-drug interactions in cancer therapies.","Lam, Cheng, Zhou, Cheung, Zuo","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13020-020-00356-4","20200928","Anticancer drugs; Cytotoxic drugs; HerbÃ¢â‚¬â€œdrug interaction; Lingzhi; Medicinal mushrooms; Yunzhi","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16416,""
"Screening of Parkinsonian subtle fine-motor impairment from touchscreen typing via deep learning","Fine-motor impairment (FMI) is progressively expressed in early Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients and is now known to be evident in the immediate prodromal stage of the condition. The clinical techniques for detecting FMI may not be robust enough and here, we show that the subtle FMI of early PD patients can be effectively estimated from the analysis of natural smartphone touchscreen typing via deep learning networks, trained in stages of initialization and fine-tuning. In a validation dataset of 36,000 typing sessions from 39 subjects (17 healthy/22 PD patients with medically validated UPDRS Part III single-item scores), the proposed approach achieved values of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.89 (95% confidence interval: 0.80-0.96) with sensitivity/specificity: 0.90/0.83. The derived estimations result in statistically significant ([Formula: see text]) correlation of 0.66/0.73/0.58 with the clinical standard UPDRS Part III items 22/23/31, respectively. Further validation analysis on 9 de novo PD patients vs. 17 healthy controls classification resulted in AUC of 0.97 (0.93-1.00) with 0.93/0.90. For 253 remote study participants, with self-reported health status providing 252.000 typing sessions via a touchscreen typing data acquisition mobile app (iPrognosis), the proposed approach predicted 0.79 AUC (0.66-0.91) with 0.76/0.71. Remote and unobtrusive screening of subtle FMI via natural smartphone usage, may assist in consolidating early and accurate diagnosis of PD.","Iakovakis, Chaudhuri, Klingelhoefer, Bostantjopoulou, Katsarou, Trivedi, Reichmann, Hadjidimitriou, Charisis, Hadjileontiadis","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69369-1","20201023","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16417,""
"Artificial Intelligence in Health Care: Bibliometric Analysis","As a critical driving power to promote health care, the health care-related artificial intelligence (AI) literature is growing rapidly. The purpose of this analysis is to provide a dynamic and longitudinal bibliometric analysis of health care-related AI publications. The Web of Science (Clarivate PLC) was searched to retrieve all existing and highly cited AI-related health care research papers published in English up to December 2019. Based on bibliometric indicators, a search strategy was developed to screen the title for eligibility, using the abstract and full text where needed. The growth rate of publications, characteristics of research activities, publication patterns, and research hotspot tendencies were computed using the HistCite software. The search identified 5235 hits, of which 1473 publications were included in the analyses. Publication output increased an average of 17.02% per year since 1995, but the growth rate of research papers significantly increased to 45.15% from 2014 to 2019. The major health problems studied in AI research are cancer, depression, Alzheimer disease, heart failure, and diabetes. Artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and convolutional neural networks have the highest impact on health care. Nucleosides, convolutional neural networks, and tumor markers have remained research hotspots through 2019. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-related research conducted in the field of health care, which helps researchers, policy makers, and practitioners better understand the development of health care-related AI research and possible practice implications.

"Deep learning-based image analysis methods for brightfield-acquired multiplex immunohistochemistry images","Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) permits the labeling of six or more distinct cell types within a single histologic tissue section. The classification of each cell type requires detection of the unique colored chromogens localized to cells expressing biomarkers of interest. The most comprehensive and reproducible method to evaluate such slides is to employ digital pathology and image analysis pipelines to whole-slide images (WSIs). Our suite of deep learning tools quantitatively evaluates the expression of six biomarkers in mIHC WSIs. These methods address the current lack of readily available methods to evaluate more than four biomarkers and circumvent the need for specialized instrumentation to spectrally separate different colors. The use case application for our methods is a study that investigates tumor immune interactions in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with a customized mIHC panel. Six different colored chromogens were utilized to label T-cells (CD3, CD4, CD8), B-cells (CD20), macrophages (CD16), and tumor cells (K17) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) PDAC tissue sections. We leveraged pathologist annotations to develop complementary deep learning-based methods: (1) ColorAE is a deep autoencoder which segments stained objects based on color; (2) U-Net is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to segment cells based on color, texture and shape; and ensemble methods that employ both ColorAE and U-Net, collectively referred to as (3) ColorAE:U-Net. We assessed the performance of our methods using: structural similarity and DICE score to evaluate segmentation results of ColorAE against traditional color deconvolution; F1 score, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and DICE score to evaluate the predictions from ColorAE, U-Net, and ColorAE:U-Net ensemble methods against pathologist-generated ground truth. We then used prediction results for spatial analysis (nearest neighbor). We observed that (1) the performance of ColorAE is comparable to traditional color deconvolution for single-stain IHC images (note: traditional color deconvolution cannot be used for mIHC); (2) ColorAE and U-Net are complementary methods that detect 6 different classes of cells with comparable performance; (3) combinations of ColorAE and U-Net into ensemble methods outperform using either ColorAE and U-Net alone; and (4) ColorAE:U-Net ensemble methods can be employed for detailed analysis of the tumor microenvironment (TME). We developed a suite of scalable deep learning methods to analyze 6 distinctly labeled cell populations in mIHC WSIs. We evaluated our methods and found that they reliably detected and classified cells in the PDAC tumor microenvironment. We also present a use case, wherein we apply the ColorAE:U-Net ensemble method across 3 mIHC WSIs and use the predictions to quantify all stained cell populations and perform nearest neighbor spatial analysis. Thus, we provide proof of concept that these methods can be employed to quantitatively describe the spatial distribution immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. These complementary deep learning methods are readily deployable for use in clinical research studies.","Fassler, Abousamra, Gupta, Chen, Zhao, Paredes, Batool, Knudsen, Escobar-Hoyos, Shroyer, Samaras, Kurc, Saltz","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13000-020-01003-0","20200926","Deep learning; Digital pathology image analysis; Multiplex immunohistochemistry; Tumor immune microenvironment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16419,""

"High pooled performance of convolutional neural networks in computer-aided diagnosis of GI ulcers and/or hemorrhage on wireless capsule endoscopy images: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Diagnosis of GI ulcers and/or hemorrhage by wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is limited by the physician-dependent, tedious, time-consuming process of image and/ or video classification. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) by convolutional neural network (CNN)-based machine learning may help reduce this burden. Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis and appraise the reported data. Multiple databases were searched (from inception to November 2019), and studies that reported on the performance of CNN in the diagnosis of GI ulcerations and/or hemorrhage on WCE were selected. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled rates. In cases where multiple 2Ã‚Â Ãƒâ€” 2 contingency tables were provided for different thresholds, we assumed the data tables were independent from each other. Heterogeneity was assessed by I<sup>2</sup>% and 95% prediction intervals. Nine studies were included in our final analysis that evaluated the performance of CNN-based CAD of GI ulcers and/or hemorrhage by WCE. The pooled accuracy was 95.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.3-96.3), sensitivity was 95.5% (95% CI, 94-96.5), specificity was 95.8% (95% CI, 94.7-96.6), positive predictive value was 95.8% (95% CI, 90.5-98.2), and negative predictive value was 96.8% (95% CI, 94.9-98.1). I<sup>2</sup>% heterogeneity was negligible except for the pooled positive predictive value. Based on our meta-analysis, CNN-based CAD of GI ulcerations and/or hemorrhage on WCE achieves a high-level performance. The quality of the evidence is robust, and therefore CNN-based CAD has the potential to become the first choice of machine learning to optimize WCE image/video reading.","Mohan, Khan, Kassab, Ponnada, Chandan, Ali, Dulai, Adler, Kochhar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.07.038","20201031","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16422,""

"A graph-based method for reconstructing entities from coordination ellipsis in medical text","Coordination ellipsis is a linguistic phenomenon abound in medical text and is challenging for concept normalization because of difficulty in recognizing elliptical expressions referencing 2 or more entities accurately. To resolve this bottleneck, we aim to contribute a generalizable method to reconstruct concepts from medical coordinated elliptical expressions in a variety of biomedical corpora. We proposed a graph-based representation model and built a pipeline to reconstruct concepts from coordinated elliptical expressions in medical text (RECEEM). There are 4 modules: (1) identify all possible candidate conjunct pairs from original coordinated elliptical expressions, (2) calculate coefficients for candidate conjuncts using the embedding model, (3) select the most appropriate decompositions by global optimization, and (4) rebuild concepts based on a pathfinding algorithm. We evaluated the pipeline's performance on 2658 coordinated elliptical expressions from 3 different medical corpora (ie, biomedical literature, clinical narratives, and eligibility criteria from clinical trials). Precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated. The F1 scores for biomedical publications, clinical narratives, and research eligibility criteria were 0.862, 0.721, and 0.870, respectively. RECEEM outperformed 2 previously released methods. By incorporating RECEEM into 2 existing NLP tools, the F1 scores increased from 0.248 to 0.460 and from 0.287 to 0.630 on concept mapping of 1125 coordination ellipses. RECEEM improves concept normalization for medical coordinated elliptical expressions in a variety of biomedical corpora. It outperformed existing methods and significantly enhanced the performance of 2 notable NLP systems for mapping coordination ellipses in the evaluation.

"Unified Medical Language System resources improve sieve-based generation and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based ranking for concept normalization","Concept normalization, the task of linking phrases in text to concepts in an ontology, is useful for many downstream tasks including relation extraction, information retrieval, etc. We present a generate-and-rank concept normalization system based on our participation in the 2019 National NLP Clinical Challenges Shared Task Track 3 Concept Normalization. The shared task provided 13Ã‚Â 609 concept mentions drawn from 100 discharge summaries. We first design a sieve-based system that uses Lucene indices over the training data, Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) preferred terms, and UMLS synonyms to generate a list of possible concepts for each mention. We then design a listwise classifier based on the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) neural network to rank the candidate concepts, integrating UMLS semantic types through a regularizer. Our generate-and-rank system was third of 33 in the competition, outperforming the candidate generator alone (81.66% vs 79.44%) and the previous state of the art (76.35%). During postevaluation, the model's accuracy was increased to 83.56% via improvements to how training data are generated from UMLS and incorporation of our UMLS semantic type regularizer. Analysis of the model shows that prioritizing UMLS preferred terms yields better performance, that the UMLS semantic type regularizer results in qualitatively better concept predictions, and that the model performs well even on concepts not seen during training. Our generate-and-rank framework for UMLS concept normalization integrates key UMLS features like preferred terms and semantic types with a neural network-based ranking model to accurately link phrases in text to UMLS concepts.","Xu, Gopale, Zhang, Brown, Begoli, Bethard","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa080","20201022","concept normalization; deep learning; generate-and-rank; natural language processing; unified medical language system","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16425,""
"COVID-19 Coronavirus Vaccine Design Using Reverse Vaccinology and Machine Learning","To ultimately combat the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, it is desired to develop an effective and safe vaccine against this highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane (M) protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. However, these vaccine candidates might lack the induction of complete protection and have safety concerns. We then applied the Vaxign and the newly developed machine learning-based Vaxign-ML reverse vaccinology tools to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Our Vaxign analysis found that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein sequence is conserved with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but not from the other four human coronaviruses causing mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10), were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and the predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be localized on the surface of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets have the potential for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development. We also propose that an &quot;Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine&quot; containing a structural protein(s) (Sp) and a non-structural protein(s) (Nsp) would stimulate effective complementary immune responses.","Ong, Wong, Huffman, He","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01581","20200803","COVID-19; S protein; machine learning; non-structural protein 3; reverse vaccinology; vaccine; vaxign; vaxign-ML; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte; Humans; Immunogenicity, Vaccine; Machine Learning; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Viral Proteins; Viral Vaccines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16426,""
"Online resources and apps to aid self-diagnosis and help seeking in the perinatal period: A descriptive survey of women's experiences","Assess the role of online resources and apps for women's help seeking and staff's response to concerns in the perinatal period. Online survey. Descriptive analysis of women's use and experiences of digital resources for self-diagnosis and help seeking, drawing on numerical and free-text responses. Two tertiary referral centres and one district general hospital in two UK geographic locations. 632 postnatal women, surveyed over a 4 month period. Women's access to digital devices; frequency and type of health concerns experienced after 22 weeks' gestation; variability in use and experiences of websites/apps; perceptions of staff's response to concerns after help-seeking. 1254 women were approached over a 4-month period; 632 participated (response rate: 50%). Women reported a 'mix and match' blended use of digital resources to both learn about, and self-diagnose/self-triage for potential complications in pregnancy as an adjunct to care provided by maternity staff. Over half the participants experienced concerns about themselves or their baby after 22 weeks. The top concern was fetal movements, reported by 62%. Women used 91 different digital resources to help with understanding and decision-making, in addition to seeking support from family, friends and healthcare professionals. Enabling features of staff responses were identified from free-text responses (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯292) by women who sought professional help regarding their health concerns, and influencing factors at clinical, organisational and digital level. Online information retrieval and digital self-monitoring is increasingly integral to women's self-care during pregnancy and offers opportunities to support escalation of care and shared decision-making. Further work should assess optimal inclusion of this 'digital work' into clinical consultations.","Mackintosh, Agarwal, Adcock, Armstrong, Briley, Patterson, Sandall, Sarah Gong","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2020.102803","20201005","Health concerns; Online resources; Perinatal care; Self-diagnosis; eHealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16427,""
"Identifying prostate cancer and its clinical risk in asymptomatic men using machine learning of high dimensional peripheral blood flow cytometric natural killer cell subset phenotyping data","We demonstrate that prostate cancer can be identified by flow cytometric profiling of blood immune cell subsets. Herein, we profiled natural killer (NK) cell subsets in the blood of 72 asymptomatic men with Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels &lt; 20 ng ml<sup>-1</sup>, of whom 31 had benign disease (no cancer) and 41 had prostate cancer. Statistical and computational methods identified a panel of eight phenotypic features ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]) that, when incorporated into an Ensemble machine learning prediction model, distinguished between the presence of benign prostate disease and prostate cancer. The machine learning model was then adapted to predict the D'Amico Risk Classification using data from 54 patients with prostate cancer and was shown to accurately differentiate between the presence of low-/intermediate-risk disease and high-risk disease without the need for additional clinical data. This simple blood test has the potential to transform prostate cancer diagnostics. With an estimated 1.8 million new cases in 2018 alone, prostate cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the world. Catching the disease early increases the chances of survival, but this cancer remains difficult to detect. The best diagnostic test currently available measures the blood level of a protein called the prostate-specific antigen (PSA for short). Heightened amounts of PSA may mean that the patient has cancer, but 15% of individuals with prostate cancer have normal levels of the protein, and many healthy people can have high amounts of PSA. This blood test is therefore not widely accepted as a reliable diagnostic tool. Other methods exist to detect prostate cancer, yet their results are limited. A small piece of the prostate can be taken for analysis, but results from this invasive procedure are often incorrect. Scans can help to spot a tumor, but they are not accurate enough to be conclusive on their own. New tests are therefore urgently needed. Prostate cancer is often associated with changes in the immune system that can be detected through a blood test. In particular, the appearance of a type of white blood (immune) cells called natural killer cells may be altered. Yet, it was unclear whether measurements based on these cells could help to detect prostate cancer and assess the severity of the disease. Here, Hood, Cosma et al. collected and examined the natural killer cells of 72 participants with slightly elevated PSA levels and no other symptoms. Amongst these, 31 individuals had prostate cancer and 41 were healthy. These biological data were then used to produce computer models that could detect the presence of the disease, as well as assess its severity. The algorithms were developed using machine learning, where previous patient information is used to make prediction on new data. This work resulted in a new detection tool which was 12.5% more accurate than the PSA test in detecting prostate cancer; and in a detection tool that was 99% accurate in predicting the risk of the disease (in terms of clinical significance) in individuals with prostate cancer. Although these new approaches first need to be validated in the clinic before being deployed, they could ultimately improve the detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer, saving lives and reducing the need for further tests.","Hood, Cosma, Foulds, Johnson, Reeder, McArdle, Khan, Pockley","https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.50936","20200901","cancer biology; computational biology; diagnosis; human; immune phenotyping; machine learning; natural killer (NK) cells; prostate cancer; prostate specific antigen (psa); systems biology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16428,""
"A Coordinated Approach by Public Domain Bioinformatics Resources to Aid the Fight Against Alzheimer's Disease Through Expert Curation of Key Protein Targets","The analysis and interpretation of data generated from patient-derived clinical samples relies on access to high-quality bioinformatics resources. These are maintained and updated by expert curators extracting knowledge from unstructured biological data described in free-text journal articles and converting this into more structured, computationally-accessible forms. This enables analyses such as functional enrichment of sets of genes/proteins using the Gene Ontology, and makes the searching of data more productive by managing issues such as gene/protein name synonyms, identifier mapping, and data quality. To undertake a coordinated annotation update of key public-domain resources to better support Alzheimer's disease research. We have systematically identified target proteins critical to disease process, in part by accessing informed input from the clinical research community. Data from 954 papers have been added to the UniProtKB, Gene Ontology, and the International Molecular Exchange Consortium (IMEx) databases, with 299 human proteins and 279 orthologs updated in UniProtKB. 745 binary interactions were added to the IMEx human molecular interaction dataset. This represents a significant enhancement in the expert curated data pertinent to Alzheimer's disease available in a number of biomedical databases. Relevant protein entries have been updated in UniProtKB and concomitantly in the Gene Ontology. Molecular interaction networks have been significantly extended in the IMEx Consortium dataset and a set of reference protein complexes created.

"Temporal Expression Classification and Normalization From Chinese Narrative Clinical Texts: Pattern Learning Approach","Temporal information frequently exists in the representation of the disease progress, prescription, medication, surgery progress, or discharge summary in narrative clinical text. The accurate extraction and normalization of temporal expressions can positively boost the analysis and understanding of narrative clinical texts to promote clinical research and practice. The goal of the study was to propose a novel approach for extracting and normalizing temporal expressions from Chinese narrative clinical text. TNorm, a rule-based and pattern learning-based approach, has been developed for automatic temporal expression extraction and normalization from unstructured Chinese clinical text data. TNorm consists of three stages: extraction, classification, and normalization. It applies a set of heuristic rules and automatically generated patterns for temporal expression identification and extraction of clinical texts. Then, it collects the features of extracted temporal expressions for temporal type prediction and classification by using machine learning algorithms. Finally, the features are combined with the rule-based and a pattern learning-based approach to normalize the extracted temporal expressions. The evaluation dataset is a set of narrative clinical texts in Chinese containing 1459 discharge summaries of a domestic Grade A Class 3 hospital. The results show that TNorm, combined with temporal expressions extraction and temporal types prediction, achieves a precision of 0.8491, a recall of 0.8328, and a F1 score of 0.8409 in temporal expressions normalization. This study illustrates an automatic approach, TNorm, that extracts and normalizes temporal expression from Chinese narrative clinical texts. TNorm was evaluated on the basis of discharge summary data, and results demonstrate its effectiveness on temporal expression normalization.","Pan, Chen, Weng, Gong, Qu","https://doi.org/10.2196/17652","20200928","Clinical text; Heuristic rule; Machine learning; Pattern learning; Temporal expression extraction; Temporal expression normalization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16430,""

"Detecting Seizures and Epileptiform Abnormalities in Acute Brain Injury","Acute brain injury (ABI) is a broad category of pathologies, including traumatic brain injury, and is commonly complicated by seizures. Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies are used to detect seizures or other epileptiform patterns. This review seeks to clarify EEG findings relevant to ABI, explore practical barriers limiting EEG implementation, discuss strategies to leverage EEG monitoring in various clinical settings, and suggest an approach to utilize EEG for triage. Current literature suggests there is an increased morbidity and mortality risk associated with seizures or patterns on the ictal-interictal continuum (IIC) due to ABI. Further, increased use of EEG is associated with better clinical outcomes. However, there are many logistical barriers to successful EEG implementation that prohibit its ubiquitous use. Solutions to these limitations include the use of rapid EEG systems, non-expert EEG analysis, machine learning algorithms, and the incorporation of EEG data into prognostic models.","Singla, Garcia, Rovenolt, Soto, Gilmore, Hirsch, Blumenfeld, Sheth, Omay, Struck, Westover, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11910-020-01060-4","20200727","Acute brain injury; EEG; Rapid EEG; monitoring; seizures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16432,""
"Cryptic asymptomatic parasellar high signal on time-of-flight MR angiography: how to resolve the clinical conundrum","Hyperintense parasellar signal on time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA) in asymptomatic patients may be due to a variety of nonpathological causes and mimic parasellar high flow signal in pathological arteriovenous shunts at the cavernous sinus (CSAVS). This creates a clinical conundrum between diagnosing an aggressive yet asymptomatic CSAVS subtype against exposing patients without CSAVS to potential complications of an invasive angiographic evaluation. We reviewed common nonpathological causes of hyperintense parasellar signal and contrast their imaging features against those of pathological CSAVS and proposed a systemic approach to resolve such conundrum. The anatomy of the cavernous sinus (CS) and causes of nonpathological parasellar hyperintense TOF-MRA signal are described and explained with case reviews, illustrations, and reference to published literature where appropriate. Imaging features of proven CSAVS are juxtaposed to aid in radiological differentiation. An algorithm is proposed to manage patients with such incidental TOF-MRA findings. The margins, contour, extent, intensity, and stippling appearance aid in evaluation of pathological versus incidental TOF-MRA parasellar signal, and differentiation of CSAVS from nonpathological causes. Pertinent radiological features are summarized in a table. For unresolved cases suspected for CSAVS, further evaluation with dynamic time-resolved contrast-enhanced MRA is proposed and depicted in a decision tree flow chart. Familiarity with the differentiating radiological features and a systematic management workflow could aid in resolving the clinical conundrum of findings of cryptic asymptomatic parasellar TOF-MRA high signal, while facilitating timely detection of the asymptomatic CSAVS.","Lim, Raj, Kee, Sim, Ho Mien, Ho, McAdory, Lim, Chan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-020-02482-0","20200727","Carotico-cavernous sinus fistula; Contrast-enhanced MRA; Dural arteriovenous fistula; Parasellar high flow; Parasellar hyperintense signal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16433,""
"Radiomics of Coronary Artery Calcium in the Framingham Heart Study","To extract radiomic features from coronary artery calcium (CAC) on CT images and to determine whether this approach could improve the ability to identify individuals at risk for a composite endpoint of clinical events. Participants from the Offspring and Third Generation cohorts of the community-based Framingham Heart Study underwent noncontrast cardiac CT (2002-2005) and were followed for more than a median of 9.1 years for composite major events. A total of 624 participants with CAC Agatston score (AS) of greater than 0 and good or excellent CT image quality were included for manual CAC segmentation and extraction of a predefined set of radiomic features reflecting intensity, shape, and texture. In a discovery cohort (<i>n</i> = 318), machine learning was used to select the 20 most informative and nonredundant CAC radiomic features, classify features predicting events, and define a radiomic-based score (RS). Performance of the RS was tested independently for the prediction of events in a validation cohort (<i>n</i> = 306). The RS had a median value of 0.08 (interquartile range, 0.007-0.71) and a weak and modest correlation with Framingham risk score (FRS) (<i>r</i> = 0.2) and AS (<i>r</i> = 0.39), respectively. The continuous RS unadjusted, adjusted for age and sex, FRS, AS, and FRS plus AS were significantly associated with events (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.2, <i>P</i> &lt; .001; HR = 1.8, <i>P</i> = .002; HR = 2.0, <i>P</i> &lt; .001; HR = 1.7, <i>P</i> = .02; and HR = 1.8, <i>P</i> = .01, respectively). In participants with AS of less than 300, RS association with events remained significant when unadjusted and adjusted for age and sex, FRS, AS, and FRS plus AS (HR = 2.4, 2.8, 2.8, 2.3, and 2.6; <i>P</i> &lt; .001, respectively). In the same subgroup of participants, adding the RS to AS resulted in a significant improvement in the discriminatory ability for events as compared with the AS (area under the receiver operating curve: 0.80 vs 0.68, respectively; <i>P</i> = .03).

"Automatic cancer detection on digital histopathology images of mid-gland radical prostatectomy specimens","<b>Purpose:</b> Automatic cancer detection on radical prostatectomy (RP) sections facilitates graphical and quantitative surgical pathology reporting, which can potentially benefit postsurgery follow-up care and treatment planning. It can also support imaging validation studies using a histologic reference standard and pathology research studies. This problem is challenging due to the large sizes of digital histopathology whole-mount whole-slide images (WSIs) of RP sections and staining variability across different WSIs. <b>Approach:</b> We proposed a calibration-free adaptive thresholding algorithm, which compensates for staining variability and yields consistent tissue component maps (TCMs) of the nuclei, lumina, and other tissues. We used and compared three machine learning methods for classifying each cancer versus noncancer region of interest (ROI) throughout each WSI: (1)Ã‚Â conventional machine learning methods and 14 texture features extracted from TCMs, (2)Ã‚Â transfer learning with pretrained AlexNet fine-tuned by TCM ROIs, and (3)Ã‚Â transfer learning with pretrained AlexNet fine-tuned with raw image ROIs. <b>Results:</b> The three methods yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96, 0.98, and 0.98, respectively, in leave-one-patient-out cross validation using 1.3Ã‚Â million ROIs from 286 mid-gland whole-mount WSIs from 68 patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> Transfer learning with the use of TCMs demonstrated state-of-the-art overall performance and is more stable with respect to sample size across different tissue types. For the tissue types involving Gleason 5 (most aggressive) cancer, it achieved the best performance compared to the other tested methods. This tool can be translated to clinical workflow to assist graphical and quantitative pathology reporting for surgical specimens upon further multicenter validation.","Han, Johnson, Warner, Gaed, Gomez, Moussa, Chin, Pautler, Bauman, Ward","https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JMI.7.4.047501","20200928","machine learning; prostate cancer detection; radical prostatectomy pathology; tissue component segmentation; transfer learning; whole-slide histopathology imaging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16435,""
"Improving the Generalizability of Convolutional Neural Network-Based Segmentation on CMR Images","<b>Background:</b> Convolutional neural network (CNN) based segmentation methods provide an efficient and automated way for clinicians to assess the structure and function of the heart in cardiac MR images. While CNNs can generally perform the segmentation tasks with high accuracy when training and test images come from the same domain (e.g., same scanner or site), their performance often degrades dramatically on images from different scanners or clinical sites. <b>Methods:</b> We propose a simple yet effective way for improving the network generalization ability by carefully designing data normalization and augmentation strategies to accommodate common scenarios in multi-site, multi-scanner clinical imaging data sets. We demonstrate that a neural network trained on a single-site single-scanner dataset from the UK Biobank can be successfully applied to segmenting cardiac MR images across different sites and different scanners without substantial loss of accuracy. Specifically, the method was trained on a large set of 3,975 subjects from the UK Biobank. It was then directly tested on 600 different subjects from the UK Biobank for intra-domain testing and two other sets for cross-domain testing: the ACDC dataset (100 subjects, 1 site, 2 scanners) and the BSCMR-AS dataset (599 subjects, 6 sites, 9 scanners). <b>Results:</b> The proposed method produces promising segmentation results on the UK Biobank test set which are comparable to previously reported values in the literature, while also performing well on cross-domain test sets, achieving a mean Dice metric of 0.90 for the left ventricle, 0.81 for the myocardium, and 0.82 for the right ventricle on the ACDC dataset; and 0.89 for the left ventricle, 0.83 for the myocardium on the BSCMR-AS dataset. <b>Conclusions:</b> The proposed method offers a potential solution to improve CNN-based model generalizability for the cross-scanner and cross-site cardiac MR image segmentation task.","Chen, Bai, Davies, Bhuva, Manisty, Augusto, Moon, Aung, Lee, Sanghvi, Fung, Paiva, Petersen, Lukaschuk, Piechnik, Neubauer, Rueckert","https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2020.00105","20200928","artificial intelligence; cardiac MR image segmentation; cardiac image analysis; deep learning; model generalization; neural network","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16436,""
"Long-Term Spinal Cord Stimulation After Chronic Complete Spinal Cord Injury Enables Volitional Movement in the Absence of Stimulation","<b>Background:</b> Chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) portends a low probability of recovery, especially in the most severe subset of motor-complete injuries. Active spinal cord stimulation with or without intensive locomotor training has been reported to restore movement after traumatic SCI. Only three cases have been reported where participants developed restored volitional movement with active stimulation turned off after a period of chronic stimulation and only after intensive rehabilitation with locomotor training. It is unknown whether restoration of movement without stimulation is possible after stimulation alone. <b>Objective:</b> We describe the development of spontaneous volitional movement (SVM) without active stimulation in a subset of participants in the Epidural Stimulation After Neurologic Damage (ESTAND) trial, in which locomotor training is not prescribed as part of the study protocol, and subject's rehabilitation therapies are not modified. <b>Methods:</b> Volitional movement was evaluated with the Brain Motor Control Assessment using sEMG recordings and visual examination at baseline and at follow-up visits with and without stimulation. Additional functional assessment with a motor-assisted bicycle exercise at follow-up with and without stimulation identified generated work with and without effort. <b>Results:</b> The first seven participants had ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) A or B thoracic SCI, a mean age of 42 years, and 7.7 years post-injury on average. Four patients developed evidence of sustained volitional movement, even in the absence of active stimulation after undergoing chronic epidural spinal cord stimulation (eSCS). Significant increases in volitional power were found between those observed to spontaneously move without stimulation and those unable (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0005). The likelihood of recovery of spontaneous volitional control was correlated with spasticity scores prior to the start of eSCS therapy (<i>p</i> = 0.048). Volitional power progressively improved over time (<i>p</i> = 0.016). Additionally, cycling was possible without stimulation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.005). <b>Conclusion:</b> While some SVM after eSCS has been reported in the literature, this study demonstrates sustained restoration without active stimulation after long-term eSCS stimulation in chronic and complete SCI in a subset of participants. This finding supports previous studies suggesting that &quot;complete&quot; SCI is likely not as common as previously believed, if it exists at all in the absence of transection and that preserved pathways are substrates for eSCS-mediated recovery in clinically motor-complete SCI. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT03026816.","PeÃƒÂ±a Pino, Hoover, Venkatesh, Ahmadi, Sturtevant, Patrick, Freeman, Parr, Samadani, Balser, Krassioukov, Phillips, Netoff, Darrow","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00035","20200928","human; neuromodulation; spinal cord injury; spinal cord stimulation; traumatic spinal cord injury; volitional movement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16437,""
"Attention and Communication Following TBI: Making the Connection through a Meta-Narrative Systematic Review","Communication difficulties are one of the hallmark characteristics of adults following traumatic brain injury (TBI), a difficulty that incorporates multiple aspects of cognition and language. One aspect of cognition that impacts communication is attention. This review explores both attention and communication following moderate to severe TBI and aims to connect them through a narrative analysis of the discourse surrounding the terms and how they have evolved over time. This includes exploring and reviewing theories and specific constructs of these two aspects of cognition. A meta-narrative systematic literature review was completed according to RAMESES methodology. A total of 37 articles were included in the review. The disciplines that populated the articles included, but were not limited to, speech language pathology (SLP) 36.5%, psychology 23.8%, and a collaboration of neuropsychology and SLP 7.9%. Of the papers that were included, 10% explored and supported theories of attention related to executive function affecting communication. Specific levels of attention were mapped onto specific communication skills with the corresponding year and authors to create a timeline and narrative of these concepts. The main communication behaviours that are related to attention in the context of post-TBI cognition include discourse, tangential communication, social communication, auditory comprehension, verbal reasoning, topic maintenance, interpretation of social cues and emotions, verbal expression, reading comprehension, verbal response speed, and subvocal rehearsal.","VanSolkema, McCann, Barker-Collo, Foster","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11065-020-09445-5","20200929","Attention; Cognitive communication; Meta-narrative review; Traumatic brain injury","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16438,""
"Autism spectrum disorder risk prediction: A systematic review of behavioral and neural investigations","A reliable diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is difficult to make until after toddlerhood. Detection in an earlier age enables early intervention, which is typically more effective. Recent studies of the development of brain and behavior in infants and toddlers have provided important insights in the diagnosis of autism. This extensive review focuses on published studies of predicting the diagnosis of autism during infancy and toddlerhood younger than 3 years using behavioral and neuroimaging approaches. After screening a total of 782 papers, 17 neuroimaging and 43 behavioral studies were reviewed. The features for prediction consist of behavioral measures using screening tools, observational and experimental methods, brain volumetric measures, and neural functional activation and connectivity patterns. The classification approaches include logistic regression, linear discriminant function, decision trees, support vector machine, and deep learning based methods. Prediction performance has large variance across different studies. For behavioral studies, the sensitivity varies from 20% to 100%, and specificity ranges from 48% to 100%. The accuracy rates range from 61% to 94% in neuroimaging studies. Possible factors contributing to this inconsistency may be partially due to the heterogeneity of ASD, different targeted populations (i.e., high-risk group for ASD and general population), age when the features were collected, and validation procedures. The translation to clinical practice requires extensive further research including external validation with large sample size and optimized feature selection. The use of multi-modal features, e.g., combination of neuroimaging and behavior, is worth further investigation to improve the prediction accuracy.","Geng, Kang, Wong","https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2020.04.015","20200731","Autism spectrum disorder; EEG; Early prediction of diagnosis outcome; Eye movement; MRI; Screening tools","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16439,""
"[Role of artificial intelligence in assessing the extent and progression of dermatoses]","In recent years, many medical specialties with aÃ‚Â visual focus have been revolutionized by image analysis algorithms using artificial intelligence (AI). As dermatology belongs to this field, it has the potential to play aÃ‚Â pioneering role in the use of AI. The current use of AI for the diagnosis and follow-up of dermatoses is reviewed and the future potential of these technologies is discussed. This article is based on aÃ‚Â selective review of the literature using Embase and MEDLINE and the keywords &quot;psoriasis&quot;, &quot;eczema&quot;, &quot;dermatoses&quot; and &quot;acne&quot; combined with &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;, &quot;machine learning&quot;, &quot;deep learning&quot;, &quot;neural network&quot;, &quot;computer-guided&quot;, &quot;supervised machine learning&quot; or &quot;unsupervised machine learning&quot; were searched. In comparison to examiner-dependent intra- and interindividually fluctuating scores for the assessment of inflammatory dermatoses (e.g. the Psoriasis Areas Severity Index [PASI] and body surface area [BSA]), AI-based algorithms can potentially offer reproducible, standardized evaluations of these scores. Whereas promising algorithms have already been developed for the diagnosis of psoriasis, there is currently only scarce work on the use of AI in the context of eczema. The latest developments in this field show the enormous potential of AI-based diagnostics and follow-up of dermatological clinical pictures by means of an autonomous computer-based image analysis. These noninvasive, optical examination methods provide valuable additional information, but dermatological interaction remains indispensable in daily clinical practice.","Maul, Meienberger, Kaufmann","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00105-020-04657-5","20200910","Algorithms; Dermatological clinical pictures; Image analysis; Machine learning; Scores; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Humans; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Skin Diseases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16440,""
"Experiences of digital communication with automated patient interviews and asynchronous chat in Swedish primary care: a qualitative study","To explore staff experiences of working with a digital communication platform implemented throughout several primary healthcare centres in Sweden. A descriptive qualitative approach using focus group interviews. Qualitative content analysis was used to code, categorise and thematise data. Primary healthcare centres across Sweden, in both rural and urban settings. A total of three mixed focus groups, comprising 19 general practitioners and nurses with experience using a specific digital communication platform. Five categories emerged: 'Fears and Benefits of Digital Communication', 'Altered Practice Workflow', 'Accepting the Digital Society', 'Safe and Secure for Patients' and 'Doesn't Suit Everyone and Everything'. These were abstracted into two comprehensive themes: 'Adjusting to a novel medium of communication' and 'Digitally filtered primary care', describing how staff experienced integrating the software as a useful tool for certain clinical contexts while managing the communication challenges associated with written communication. Family medicine staff were ambivalent concerning the use of digital communication but, after a period of adjustment, it was seen as a useful communication tool especially when combined with continuity of care. Staff acknowledged limitations regarding use by inappropriate patient populations, information overload and misinterpretation of text by both staff and patients.","Entezarjou, BolmsjÃƒÂ¶, Calling, MidlÃƒÂ¶v, Milos Nymberg","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036585","20200917","biotechnology &amp; bioinformatics; information technology; organisation of health services; primary care; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16441,""
"The Impact of Artificial Intelligence in the Endoscopic Assessment of Premalignant and Malignant Esophageal Lesions: Present and Future","In the gastroenterology field, the impact of artificial intelligence was investigated for the purposes of diagnostics, risk stratification of patients, improvement in quality of endoscopic procedures and early detection of neoplastic diseases, implementation of the best treatment strategy, and optimization of patient prognosis. Computer-assisted diagnostic systems to evaluate upper endoscopy images have recently emerged as a supporting tool in endoscopy due to the risks of misdiagnosis related to standard endoscopy and different expertise levels of endoscopists, time-consuming procedures, lack of availability of advanced procedures, increasing workloads, and development of endoscopic mass screening programs. Recent research has tended toward computerized, automatic, and real-time detection of lesions, which are approaches that offer utility in daily practice. Despite promising results, certain studies might overexaggerate the diagnostic accuracy of artificial systems, and several limitations remain to be overcome in the future. Therefore, additional multicenter randomized trials and the development of existent database platforms are needed to certify clinical implementation. This paper presents an overview of the literature and the current knowledge of the usefulness of different types of machine learning systems in the assessment of premalignant and malignant esophageal lesions via conventional and advanced endoscopic procedures. This study makes a presentation of the artificial intelligence terminology and refers also to the most prominent recent research on computer-assisted diagnosis of neoplasia on Barrett's esophagus and early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and prediction of invasion depth in esophageal neoplasms. Furthermore, this review highlights the main directions of future doctor-computer collaborations in which machines are expected to improve the quality of medical action and routine clinical workflow, thus reducing the burden on physicians.","LazÃ„Æ’r, Avram, Faur, GoldiÃ…Å¸, RomoÃ…Å¸an, TÃ„Æ’ban, Cornianu","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina56070364","20200812","BarrettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s esophagus; artificial intelligence; computer-assisted diagnosis; endoscopy; esophageal cancer","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16442,""
"Exploring Anatomic Variants to Enhance Anatomy Teaching: Musculus Sternalis","The opportunity to encounter and appreciate the range of human variation in anatomic structures-and its potential impact on related structures, function, and treatment-is one of the chief benefits of cadaveric dissection for students in clinical preprofessional programs. The dissection lab is also where students can examine unusual anatomic variants that may not be included in their textbooks, lab manuals, or other course materials. For students specializing in physical medicine, awareness and understanding of muscle variants has a practical relevance to their preparations for clinical practice. In a routine dissection of the superficial chest muscles, graduate students in a human gross anatomy class exposed a large, well-developed sternalis muscle. The exposure of this muscle generated many student questions about M sternalis: its prevalence and appearance, its function, its development, and its evolutionary roots. Students used an inquiry protocol to guide their searches through relevant literature to gather this information. Instructors developed a decision tree to assist students in their inquiries, both by helping them to make analytic inferences and by highlighting areas of interest needing further investigation. Answering these questions enriches the understanding and promotes &quot;habits of mind&quot; for exploring musculoskeletal anatomy beyond simple descriptions of function and structure.","Petto, Zimmerman, Johnson, Gauthier, Menor, Wohkittel","https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10080508","20200928","M sternalis; anatomic variation; learning strategies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16443,""
"Medical Knowledge Graph to Enhance Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Detection on Claim Data: Model Development and Performance Evaluation","Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) detection is a significant yet challenging problem in the health insurance industry. An essential step in FWA detection is to check whether the medication is clinically reasonable with respect to the diagnosis. Currently, human experts with sufficient medical knowledge are required to perform this task. To reduce the cost, insurance inspectors tend to build an intelligent system to detect suspicious claims with inappropriate diagnoses/medications automatically. The aim of this study was to develop an automated method for making use of a medical knowledge graph to identify clinically suspected claims for FWA detection. First, we identified the medical knowledge that is required to assess the clinical rationality of the claims. We then searched for data sources that contain information to build such knowledge. In this study, we focused on Chinese medical knowledge. Second, we constructed a medical knowledge graph using unstructured knowledge. We used a deep learning-based method to extract the entities and relationships from the knowledge sources and developed a multilevel similarity matching approach to conduct the entity linking. To guarantee the quality of the medical knowledge graph, we involved human experts to review the entity and relationships with lower confidence. These reviewed results could be used to further improve the machine-learning models. Finally, we developed the rules to identify the suspected claims by reasoning according to the medical knowledge graph. We collected 185,796 drug labels from the China Food and Drug Administration, 3390 types of disease information from medical textbooks (eg, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis), and information from 5272 examinations as the knowledge sources. The final medical knowledge graph includes 1,616,549 nodes and 5,963,444 edges. We designed three knowledge graph reasoning rules to identify three kinds of inappropriate diagnosis/medications. The experimental results showed that the medical knowledge graph helps to detect 70% of the suspected claims. The medical knowledge graph-based method successfully identified suspected cases of FWA (such as fraud diagnosis, excess prescription, and irrational prescription) from the claim documents, which helped to improve the efficiency of claim processing.","Sun, Xiao, Zhu, He, Zhang, Xu, Hou, Li, Ni, Xie","https://doi.org/10.2196/17653","20200928","FWA detection; medical knowledge graph","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16444,""
"Toward a Taxonomy for Analyzing the Heart Rate as a Physiological Indicator of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Systematic Review and Development of a Framework","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent psychiatric condition that is associated with symptoms such as hyperarousal and overreactions. Treatments for PTSD are limited to medications and in-session therapies. Assessing the way the heart responds to PTSD has shown promise in detecting and understanding the onset of symptoms. This study aimed to extract statistical and mathematical approaches that researchers can use to analyze heart rate (HR) data to understand PTSD. A scoping literature review was conducted to extract HR models. A total of 5 databases including Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline) OVID, Medline EBSCO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) EBSCO, Excerpta Medica Database (Embase) Ovid, and Google Scholar were searched. Non-English language studies, as well as studies that did not analyze human data, were excluded. A total of 54 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in this review. We identified 4 categories of models: descriptive time-independent output, descriptive and time-dependent output, predictive and time-independent output, and predictive and time-dependent output. Descriptive and time-independent output models include analysis of variance and first-order exponential; the descriptive time-dependent output model includes a classical time series analysis and mixed regression. Predictive time-independent output models include machine learning methods and analysis of the HR-based fluctuation-dissipation method. Finally, predictive time-dependent output models include the time-variant method and nonlinear dynamic modeling. All of the identified modeling categories have relevance in PTSD, although the modeling selection is dependent on the specific goals of the study. Descriptive models are well-founded for the inference of PTSD. However, there is a need for additional studies in this area that explore a broader set of predictive models and other factors (eg, activity level) that have not been analyzed with descriptive models.","Sadeghi, Sasangohar, McDonald","https://doi.org/10.2196/16654","20200928","PTSD; heart rate; mental health; physiology; statistics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16445,""
"Role of Artificial Intelligence in Patient Safety Outcomes: Systematic Literature Review","Artificial intelligence (AI) provides opportunities to identify the health risks of patients and thus influence patient safety outcomes. The purpose of this systematic literature review was to identify and analyze quantitative studies utilizing or integrating AI to address and report clinical-level patient safety outcomes. We restricted our search to the PubMed, PubMed Central, and Web of Science databases to retrieve research articles published in English between January 2009 and August 2019. We focused on quantitative studies that reported positive, negative, or intermediate changes in patient safety outcomes using AI apps, specifically those based on machine-learning algorithms and natural language processing. Quantitative studies reporting only AI performance but not its influence on patient safety outcomes were excluded from further review. We identified 53 eligible studies, which were summarized concerning their patient safety subcategories, the most frequently used AI, and reported performance metrics. Recognized safety subcategories were clinical alarms (n=9; mainly based on decision tree models), clinical reports (n=21; based on support vector machine models), and drug safety (n=23; mainly based on decision tree models). Analysis of these 53 studies also identified two essential findings: (1) the lack of a standardized benchmark and (2) heterogeneity in AI reporting. This systematic review indicates that AI-enabled decision support systems, when implemented correctly, can aid in enhancing patient safety by improving error detection, patient stratification, and drug management. Future work is still needed for robust validation of these systems in prospective and real-world clinical environments to understand how well AI can predict safety outcomes in health care settings.","Choudhury, Asan","https://doi.org/10.2196/18599","20200928","artificial intelligence; clinical error; drug; drug safety; natural language processing; patient safety; report analysis; review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16446,""

This paper aimed to provide a comprehensive review of RL applications in the critical care setting. This review aimed to survey the literature on RL applications for clinical decision support in critical care and to provide insight into the challenges of applying various RL models. We performed an extensive search of the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE). Studies published over the past 10 years (2010-2019) that have applied RL for critical care were included. We included 21 papers and found that RL has been used to optimize the choice of medications, drug dosing, and timing of interventions and to target personalized laboratory values. We further compared and contrasted the design of the RL models and the evaluation metrics for each application. RL has great potential for enhancing decision making in critical care. Challenges regarding RL system design, evaluation metrics, and model choice exist. More importantly, further work is required to validate RL in authentic clinical environments.","Liu, See, Ngiam, Celi, Sun, Feng","https://doi.org/10.2196/18477","20200818","artificial intelligence; critical care; decision support systems, clinical; intensive care unit; machine learning; reinforcement learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16447,""
"Applications of Artificial Intelligence to Electronic Health Record Data in Ophthalmology","Widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has resulted in the collection of massive amounts of clinical data. In ophthalmology in particular, the volume range of data captured in EHR systems has been growing rapidly. Yet making effective secondary use of this EHR data for improving patient care and facilitating clinical decision-making has remained challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of these data. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques present a promising way to analyze these multimodal data sets. While AI techniques have been extensively applied to imaging data, there are a limited number of studies employing AI techniques with clinical data from the EHR. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of different AI methods applied to EHR data in the field of ophthalmology. This literature review highlights that the secondary use of EHR data has focused on glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and cataracts with the use of AI techniques. These techniques have been used to improve ocular disease diagnosis, risk assessment, and progression prediction. Techniques such as supervised machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing were most commonly used in the articles reviewed.","Lin, Chen, Chiang, Hribar","https://doi.org/10.1167/tvst.9.2.13","20200928","artificial intelligence; electronic health record; machine learning; ophthalmology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16448,""
"A 3D Deep Learning System for Detecting Referable Glaucoma Using Full OCT Macular Cube Scans","The purpose of this study was to develop a 3D deep learning system from spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) macular cubes to differentiate between referable and nonreferable cases for glaucoma applied to real-world datasets to understand how this would affect the performance. There were 2805 Cirrus optical coherence tomography (OCT) macula volumes (Macula protocol 512 Ãƒâ€” 128) of 1095 eyes from 586 patients at a single site that were used to train a fully 3D convolutional neural network (CNN). Referable glaucoma included true glaucoma, pre-perimetric glaucoma, and high-risk suspects, based on qualitative fundus photographs, visual fields, OCT reports, and clinical examinations, including intraocular pressure (IOP) and treatment history as the binary (two class) ground truth. The curated real-world dataset did not include eyes with retinal disease or nonglaucomatous optic neuropathies. The cubes were first homogenized using layer segmentation with the Orion Software (Voxeleron) to achieve standardization. The algorithm was tested on two separate external validation sets from different glaucoma studies, comprised of Cirrus macular cube scans of 505 and 336 eyes, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for the development dataset for distinguishing referable glaucoma was 0.88 for our CNN using homogenization, 0.82 without homogenization, and 0.81 for a CNN architecture from the existing literature. For the external validation datasets, which had different glaucoma definitions, the AUCs were 0.78 and 0.95, respectively. The performance of the model across myopia severity distribution has been assessed in the dataset from the United States and was found to have an AUC of 0.85, 0.92, and 0.95 in the severe, moderate, and mild myopia, respectively. A 3D deep learning algorithm trained on macular OCT volumes without retinal disease to detect referable glaucoma performs better with retinal segmentation preprocessing and performs reasonably well across all levels of myopia. Interpretation of OCT macula volumes based on normative data color distributions is highly influenced by population demographics and characteristics, such as refractive error, as well as the size of the normative database. Referable glaucoma, in this study, was chosen to include cases that should be seen by a specialist. This study is unique because it uses multimodal patient data for the glaucoma definition, and includes all severities of myopia as well as validates the algorithm with international data to understand generalizability potential.","Russakoff, Mannil, Oakley, Ran, Cheung, Dasari, Riyazzuddin, Nagaraj, Rao, Chang, Chang","https://doi.org/10.1167/tvst.9.2.12","20200928","glaucoma; machine learning; suspects","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16449,""
"MAGPEL: an autoMated pipeline for inferring vAriant-driven Gene PanEls from the full-length biomedical literature","In spite of the efforts in developing and maintaining accurate variant databases, a large number of disease-associated variants are still hidden in the biomedical literature. Curation of the biomedical literature in an effort to extract this information is a challenging task due to: (i) the complexity of natural language processing, (ii) inconsistent use of standard recommendations for variant description, and (iii) the lack of clarity and consistency in describing the variant-genotype-phenotype associations in the biomedical literature. In this article, we employ text mining and word cloud analysis techniques to address these challenges. The proposed framework extracts the variant-gene-disease associations from the full-length biomedical literature and designs an evidence-based variant-driven gene panel for a given condition. We validate the identified genes by showing their diagnostic abilities to predict the patients' clinical outcome on several independent validation cohorts. As representative examples, we present our results for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer and prostate cancer. We compare these panels with other variant-driven gene panels obtained from Clinvar, Mastermind and others from literature, as well as with a panel identified with a classical differentially expressed genes (DEGs) approach. The results show that the panels obtained by the proposed framework yield better results than the other gene panels currently available in the literature.","Saberian, Shafi, Peyvandipour, Draghici","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-68649-0","20201023","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16450,""
"CT texture analysis predicts abdominal aortic aneurysm post-endovascular aortic aneurysm repair progression","The aim of this study isÃ‚Â to investigate the role of early postoperative CT texture analysis in aneurysm progression. Ninety-nine patients who had undergone post-endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm CT serial scans were enrolled from July 2014 to December 2019. The clinical and traditional imaging features were obtained. Aneurysm texture analysis was performed using three methods-the grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), the grey-level run length matrix (GLRLM), and the grey-level difference method (GLDM). A multilayer perceptron neural network was applied as a classifier, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and area under the curve (AUC) analysis were employed to illustrate the classification performance. No difference was found in the morphological and clinical features between the expansion (+) and (-) groups. GLCM yielded the best performance with an accuracy of 85.17% and an AUC of 0.90, followed by GLRLM with an accuracy of 87.23% and an AUC of 0.8615, and GLDM with an accuracy of 86.09% and an AUC of 0.8313. All three texture analyses showed superior predictive ability over clinical risk factors (accuracy: 69.41%; AUC: 0.6649), conventional imaging features (accuracy: 69.02%; AUC: 0.6747), and combined (accuracy: 75.29%; AUC: 0.7249). Early post-EVAR arterial phase-derived aneurysm texture analysis is a better predictor of later aneurysm expansion than clinical factors and traditional imaging evaluation combined.","Ding, Hao, Wang, Xuan, Kong, Xue, Jin","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69226-1","20201022","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16451,""
"[Formula: see text]: deep learning-based radiomics for the time-to-event outcome prediction in lung cancer","Hand-crafted radiomics has been used for developing models in order to predict time-to-event clinical outcomes in patients with lung cancer. Hand-crafted features, however, are pre-defined and extracted without taking the desired target into account. Furthermore, accurate segmentation of the tumor is required for development of a reliable predictive model, which may be objective and a time-consuming task. To address these drawbacks, we propose a deep learning-based radiomics model for the time-to-event outcome prediction, referred to as DRTOP that takes raw images as inputs, and calculates the image-based risk of death or recurrence, for each patient. Our experiments on an in-house dataset of 132 lung cancer patients show that the obtained image-based risks are significant predictors of the time-to-event outcomes. Computed Tomography (CT)-based features are predictors of the overall survival (OS), with the hazard ratio (HR) of 1.35, distant control (DC), with HR of 1.06, and local control (LC), with HR of 2.66. The Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-based features are predictors of OS and recurrence free survival (RFS), with hazard ratios of 1.67 and 1.18, respectively. The concordance indices of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] for predicting the OS, DC, and RFS show that the deep learning-based radiomics model is as accurate or better in predicting predefined clinical outcomes compared to hand-crafted radiomics, with concordance indices of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text], for predicting the OS, DC, and RFS, respectively. Deep learning-based radiomics has the potential to offer complimentary predictive information in the personalized management of lung cancer patients.","Afshar, Mohammadi, Tyrrell, Cheung, Sigiuk, Plataniotis, Nguyen, Oikonomou","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69106-8","20201023","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16452,""
"Long-term exposure to PM and all-cause and cause-specific mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis","As new scientific evidence on health effects of air pollution is generated, air quality guidelines need to be periodically updated. The objective of this review is to support the derivation of updated guidelines by the World Health Organization (WHO) by performing a systematic review of evidence of associations between long-term exposure to particulate matter with diameter under 2.5Ã‚Â Ã‚Âµm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and particulate matter with diameter under 10Ã‚Â Ã‚Âµm (PM<sub>10</sub>), in relation to all-cause and cause-specific mortality. As there is especially uncertainty about the relationship at the low and high end of the exposure range, the review needed to provide an indication of the shape of the concentration-response function (CRF). We systematically searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from database inception to 9 October 2018. Articles were checked for eligibility by two reviewers. We included cohort and case-control studies on outdoor air pollution in human populations using individual level data. In addition to natural-cause mortality, we evaluated mortality from circulatory diseases (ischemic heart disease (IHD) and cerebrovascular disease (stroke) also specifically), respiratory diseases (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) also specifically) and lung cancer. A random-effect meta-analysis was performed when at least three studies were available for a specific exposure-outcome pair. Risk of bias was assessed for all included articles using a specifically developed tool coordinated by WHO. Additional analyses were performed to assess consistency across geographic region, explain heterogeneity and explore the shape of the CRF. An adapted GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) assessment of the body of evidence was made using a specifically developed tool coordinated by WHO. A large number (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 107) of predominantly cohort studies (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 104) were included after screening more than 3000 abstracts. Studies were conducted globally with the majority of studies from North America (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 62) and Europe (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 25). More studies used PM<sub>2.5</sub> (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 71) as the exposure metric than PM<sub>10</sub> (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 42). PM<sub>2.5</sub> was significantly associated with all causes of death evaluated. The combined Risk Ratio (RR) for PM<sub>2.5</sub> and natural-cause mortality was 1.08 (95%CI 1.06, 1.09) per 10Ã‚Â Ã‚Âµg/m<sup>3</sup>. Meta analyses of studies conducted at the low mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels (&lt;25, 20, 15, 12, 10Ã‚Â Ã‚Âµg/m<sup>3</sup>) yielded RRs that were similar or higher compared to the overall RR, consistent with the finding of generally linear or supra-linear CRFs in individual studies. Pooled RRs were almost identical for studies conducted in North America, Europe and Western Pacific region. PM<sub>10</sub> was significantly associated with natural-cause and most but not all causes of death. Application of the risk of bias tool showed that few studies were at a high risk of bias in any domain. Application of the adapted GRADE tool resulted in an assessment of &quot;high certainty of evidence&quot; for PM<sub>2.5</sub> with all assessed endpoints except for respiratory mortality (moderate). The evidence was rated as less certain for PM<sub>10</sub> and cause-specific mortality (&quot;moderate&quot; for circulatory, IHD, COPD and &quot;low&quot; for stroke mortality. Compared to the previous global WHO evaluation, the evidence base has increased substantially. However, studies conducted in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) are still limited. There is clear evidence that both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> were associated with increased mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and lung cancer. Associations remained below the current WHO guideline exposure level of 10Ã‚Â Ã‚Âµg/m<sup>3</sup> for PM<sub>2.5</sub>.

"Approaches to text mining for analyzing treatment plan of quit smoking with free-text medical records: A PRISMA-compliant meta-analysis","Smoking is a complex behavior associated with multiple factors such as personality, environment, genetics, and emotions. Text data are a rich source of information. However, pure text data requires substantial human resources and time to extract and apply the knowledge, resulting in many details not being discovered and used. This study proposes a novel approach that explores a text mining flow to capture the behavior of smokers quitting tobacco from their free-text medical records. More importantly, the paper examines the impact of these changes on smokers. The goal is to help smokers quit smoking. The study population included adult patients that were &gt;20 years old of age who consulted the medical center's smoking cessation outpatient clinic from January to December 2016. A total of 246 patients visited the clinic in the study period. After excluding incomplete medical records or lost follow up, there were 141 patients included in the final analysis. There are 141 valid data points for patients who only treated once and patients with empty medical records. Two independent review authors will make the study selection based on the study eligibility criteria. Our participants are from all the patients that were involved in this study and the staff of Division of Family Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital. Interventions and study appraisal are not required. The paper develops an algorithm for analyzing smoking cessation treatment plans documented in free-text medical records. The approach involves the development of an information extraction flow that uses a combination of data mining techniques, including text mining. It can use not only to help others quit smoking but also for other medical records with similar data elements. The Apriori associations of our algorithm from the text mining revealed several important clinical implications for physicians during smoking cessation. For example, an apparent association between nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and other medications such as Inderal, Rivotril, Dogmatyl, and Solaxin. Inderal and Rivotril use in patients with anxiety disorders as anxiolytics frequently. Finally, we find that the rules associating with NRT combination with blood tests may imply that the use of NRT combination therapy in smokers with chronic illness may result in lower abstinence. Further large-scale surveys comparing varenicline or bupropion with NRT combination in smokers with a chronic disease are warranted. The Apriori algorithm suffers from some weaknesses despite being transparent and straightforward. The main limitation is the costly wasting of time to hold a vast number of candidates sets with frequent itemsets, low minimum support, or large itemsets. In the paper, the most visible areas for the therapeutic application of text mining are the integration and transfer of advances made in basic sciences, as well as a better understanding of the processes involved in smoking cessation. Text mining may also be useful for supporting decision-making processes associated with smoking cessation.

"Application of systematic evidence mapping to assess the impact of new research when updating health reference values: A case example using acrolein","The environmental health community needs transparent, methodologically rigorous, and rapid approaches for updating human health risk assessments. These assessments often contain reference values for cancer and/or noncancer effects. Increasingly, the use of systematic review methods are preferred when developing these assessments. Systematic evidence maps are a type of analysis that has the potential to be very helpful in the update process, especially when combined with machine-learning software advances designed to expedite the process of conducting a review. To evaluate the applicability of evidence mapping to determine whether new evidence is likely to result in a change to an existing health reference value, using inhalation exposure to the air pollutant acrolein as a case example. New literature published since the 2008 California Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) Reference Exposure Level (REL) for acrolein was assessed. Systematic review methods were used to search the literature and screening included the use of machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify studies that characterized acute and chronic exposure and could be informative for hazard characterization. Studies that met the PECO criteria after full-text review were briefly summarized before their suitability for chronic point of departure (POD) derivation and calculation of a reference value was considered. Studies considered potentially suitable underwent a targeted evaluation to determine their suitability for use in dose-response analysis. Over 15,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Both machine-learning and manual screening processes were used to identify 60 studies considered PECO-relevant after full-text review. Most of these PECO-relevant studies were short-term exposure animal studies (acute or less than 1Ã‚Â month of exposure) and considered less suitable for deriving a chronic reference value when compared to the subchronic study in rats used in the 2008 OEHHA assessment. Thirteen epidemiological studies were identified but had limitations in the exposure assessment that made them less suitable for dose-response compared to the subchronic rat study. Among the 13 studies, there were four controlled trial studies that have the potential to be informative for future acute reference value derivation. Thus, the 2008 subchronic rat study used by OEHHA appears to still be the most appropriate study for chronic reference value derivation. In addition, advances in dosimetric modeling for gases, including new evidence pertinent to acrolein, could be considered when updating existing acrolein toxicity values. Evidence mapping is a very useful tool to assess the need for updating an assessment based on understanding the potential impact of new studies on revising an existing health reference value. In this case example, the focus was to identify studies suitable for chronic exposure dose-response analysis, while also identifying studies that may be important to consider for acute exposure scenarios, hazard identification, or for future research. This allows the evidence map to be a useful resource for a range of decision-making contexts. Specialized systematic review software increased the efficiency of the process in terms of human resources and time to conduct the analysis.","Keshava, Davis, Stanek, Thayer, Galizia, Keshava, Gift, Vulimiri, Woodall, Gigot, Garcia, Greenhalgh, Schulz, Volkoff, Camargo, Persad","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105956","20200831","Evidence map; Hazard characterization; Hazardous air pollutant; Risk assessment; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16455,""
"Highly accurate classification of chest radiographic reports using a deep learning natural language model pretrained on 38 million text reports","The development of deep, bidirectional transformers such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) led to an outperformance of several Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks. Especially in radiology, large amounts of free-text data are generated in the daily clinical workflow. These report texts could be of particular use for the generation of labels in machine learning, especially for image classification. However, as report text are mostly unstructured, advanced NLP methods are needed for text classification. While neural networks can be used for this purpose, they must first be trained on large amounts of manually labelled data in order to achieve good results. In contrast, BERT models can be pre-trained on unlabelledunlabeled data and then only require fine tuning on a small amount of manually labelled data to achieve even better results. By using BERT to identify the most important findings in intensive care chest x-ray reports, we achieve areas under the receiver operation characteristics curve of 0.98 for congestion, 0.97 for effusion, 0.97 for consolidation and 0.99 for pneumothorax, surpassing the accuracy of previous approaches with comparatively little annotation effort. Our approach could help to improve information extraction from free-text medical reports.","Bressem, Adams, Gaudin, TrÃƒÂ¶ltzsch, Hamm, Makowski, SchÃƒÂ¼le, Vahldiek, Niehues","https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa668","20200723","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16456,""
"Artificial Intelligence Algorithm for Screening Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction Using Electrocardiography","Although heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a common clinical syndrome and can be modified by the administration of appropriate medical therapy, there is no adequate tool available to perform reliable, economical, early-stage screening. To meet this need, we developed an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for HFrEF screening using electrocardiography (ECG) and validated its performance. This retrospective cohort study included two hospitals. An AI algorithm based on a convolutional neural network was developed using 39,371 ECG results from 17,127 patients. The internal validation included 3,470 ECGs from 2,908 patients. Furthermore, we conducted external validation using 4,362 ECGs from 4,176 patients from another hospital to verify the applicability of the algorithm across different centers. The end-point was to detect HFrEF, defined as an ejection fraction &lt;40%. We also visualized the regions in 12 lead ECG that affected HFrEF detection in the AI algorithm and compared this to the previously documented literature. During the internal and external validation, the areas under the curves of the AI algorithm using a 12 lead ECG for detecting HFrEF were 0.913 (95% confidence interval, 0.902-0.925) and 0.961 (0.951-0.971), respectively, and the areas under the curves of the AI algorithm using a single-lead ECG were 0.874 (0.859-0.890) and 0.929 (0.911-0.946), respectively. The deep learning-based AI algorithm performed HFrEF detection well using not only a 12 lead but also a single-lead ECG. These results suggest that HFrEF can be screened not only using a 12 lead ECG, as is typical of a conventional ECG machine, but also with a single-lead ECG performed by a wearable device employing the AI algorithm, thereby preventing irreversible disease progression and mortality.","Cho, Lee, Kwon, Lee, Park, Oh, Jeon, Park, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1097/MAT.0000000000001218","20200723","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16457,""
"Statistical inference for natural language processing algorithms with a demonstration using type 2 diabetes prediction from electronic health record notes","The pointwise mutual information statistic (PMI), which measures how often two words occur together in a document corpus, is a cornerstone of recently proposed popular natural language processing algorithms such as word2vec. PMI and word2vec reveal semantic relationships between words and can be helpful in a range of applications such as document indexing, topic analysis, or document categorization. We use probability theory to demonstrate the relationship between PMI and word2vec. We use the theoretical results to demonstrate how the PMI can be modeled and estimated in a simple and straight forward manner. We further describe how one can obtain standard error estimates that account for within-patient clustering that arises from patterns of repeated words within a patient's health record due to a unique health history. We then demonstrate the usefulness of PMI on the problem of predictive identification of disease from free text notes of electronic health records. Specifically, we use our methods to distinguish those with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus in electronic health record free text data using over 400Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 clinical notes from an academic medicalÃ‚Â center.","Egleston, Bai, Bleicher, Taylor, Lutz, Vucetic","https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.13338","20200803","cluster-corrected standard errors; electronic health records; natural language processing; probability models; word2vec","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16458,""
"An online, interactive, screen-based simulator for learning basic EEG interpretation","Develop and pilot test a simulator that presents ten commonly encountered representative clinical contexts for trainees to learn basic electroencephalogram (EEG) interpretation skills. We created an interactive web-based training simulator that allows self-paced, asynchronous learning and assessment of basic EEG interpretation skills. The simulator uses the information retrieval process via a free-response text box to enhance learning. Ten scenarios were created that present dynamic (scrolling) EEG tracings resembling the clinical setting, followed by questions with free-text answers. The answer was checked against an accepted word/phrase list. The simulator has been used by 76 trainees in total. We report pilot study results from the University of Florida's neurology residents (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°24). Total percent correct for each scenario and average percent correct for all scenarios were calculated and correlated with most recent In-training Examination (ITE) and United States Medical License Examination (USMLE) scores. Neurology residents' mean percent correct scenario scores ranged from 27.1-86.0% with an average scenario score of 61.2% Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.7. We showed a moderately strong correlation rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.49 between the ITE and the average scenario score. We developed an online interactive EEG interpretation simulator to review basic EEG content and assess interpretation skills using an active retrieval approach. The pilot study showed a moderately strong correlation rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.49 between the ITE and the average scenario score. Since the ITE is a measure of clinical practice, this is evidence that the simulator can provide self-directed instruction and shows promise as a tool for assessment of EEG knowledge.","Fahy, Cibula, Johnson, Cooper, Lizdas, Gravenstein, Lampotang","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04610-3","20200723","Active retrieval; Education/methods; Electroencephalography; Graduate Medical Education; Simulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16459,""

"Clinician-centric diagnosis of rare genetic diseases: performance of a gene pertinence metric in decision support for clinicians","In diagnosis of rare genetic diseases we face a decision as to the degree to which the sequencing lab offers one or more diagnoses based on clinical input provided by the clinician, or the clinician reaches a diagnosis based on the complete set of variants provided by the lab. We tested a software approach to assist the clinician in making the diagnosis based on clinical findings and an annotated genomic variant table, using cases already solved using less automated processes. For the 81 cases studied (involving 216 individuals), 70 had genetic abnormalities with phenotypes previously described in the literature, and 11 were not described in the literature at the time of analysis (&quot;discovery genes&quot;). These included cases beyond a trio, including ones with different variants in the same gene. In 100% of cases the abnormality was recognized. Of the 70, the abnormality was ranked #1 in 94% of cases, with an average rank 1.1 for all cases. Large CNVs could be analyzed in an integrated analysis, performed in 24 of the cases. The process is rapid enough to allow for periodic reanalysis of unsolved cases. A clinician-friendly environment for clinical correlation can be provided to clinicians who are best positioned to have the clinical information needed for this interpretation.","Segal, George, Waltman, El-Hattab, James, Stanley, Gleeson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-020-01461-1","20200915","Artificial intelligence; Copy number variation; Diagnostic decision support system; Genomic analysis; Rare disease diagnosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16461,""
"New national recommendations for the treatment of pediatric differentiated thyroid carcinoma in the Netherlands","Currently, there are no European recommendations for the management of pediatric thyroid cancer. Other current international guidelines are not completely concordant. In addition, medical regulations differ between, for instance, the US and Europe. We aimed to develop new, easily accessible national recommendations for differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) patients &lt;18 years of age in the Netherlands as a first step toward a harmonized European Recommendation. A multidisciplinary working group was formed including pediatric and adult endocrinologists, a pediatric radiologist, a pathologist, endocrine surgeons, pediatric surgeons, pediatric oncologists, nuclear medicine physicians, a clinical geneticist and a patient representative. A systematic literature search was conducted for all existing guidelines and review articles for pediatric DTC from 2000 until February 2019. The Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument was used for assessing quality of the articles. All were compared to determine dis- and concordances. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) pediatric guideline 2015 was used as framework to develop specific Dutch recommendations. Discussion points based upon expert opinion and current treatment management of DTC in children in the Netherlands were identified and elaborated. Based on the most recent evidence combined with expert opinion, a 2020 Dutch recommendation for pediatric DTC was written and published as an online interactive decision tree (www.oncoguide.nl).

"Reinventing radiation therapy with machine learning and imaging bio-markers (radiomics): State-of-the-art, challenges and perspectives","Radiation therapy is a pivotal cancer treatment that has significantly progressed over the last decade due to numerous technological breakthroughs. Imaging is now playing a critical role on deployment of the clinical workflow, both for treatment planning and treatment delivery. Machine-learning analysis of predefined features extracted from medical images, i.e. radiomics, has emerged as a promising clinical tool for a wide range of clinical problems addressing drug development, clinical diagnosis, treatment selection and implementation as well as prognosis. Radiomics denotes a paradigm shift redefining medical images as a quantitative asset for data-driven precision medicine. The adoption of machine-learning in a clinical setting and in particular of radiomics features requires the selection of robust, representative and clinically interpretable biomarkers that are properly evaluated on a representative clinical data set. To be clinically relevant, radiomics must not only improve patients' management with great accuracy but also be reproducible and generalizable. Hence, this review explores the existing literature and exposes its potential technical caveats, such as the lack of quality control, standardization, sufficient sample size, type of data collection, and external validation. Based upon the analysis of 165 original research studies based on PET, CT-scan, and MRI, this review provides an overview of new concepts, and hypotheses generating findings that should be validated. In particular, it describes evolving research trends to enhance several clinical tasks such as prognostication, treatment planning, response assessment, prediction of recurrence/relapse, and prediction of toxicity. Perspectives regarding the implementation of an AI-based radiotherapy workflow are presented.","Dercle, Henry, CarrÃƒÂ©, Paragios, Deutsch, Robert","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2020.07.003","20200809","CT; MR; Machine-learning; PET; Radiation therapy; Radiomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16463,""
"Natural language processing and machine learning to enable automatic extraction and classification of patients' smoking status from electronic medical records","The electronic medical record (EMR) offers unique possibilities for clinical research, but some important patient attributes are not readily available due to its unstructured properties. We applied text mining using machine learning to enable automatic classification of unstructured information on smoking status from Swedish EMR data. Data on patients' smoking status from EMRs were used to develop 32 different predictive models that were trained using Weka, changing sentence frequency, classifier type, tokenization, and attribute selection in a database of 85,000 classified sentences. The models were evaluated using F-score and accuracy based on out-of-sample test data including 8500 sentences. The error weight matrix was used to select the best model, assigning a weight to each type of misclassification and applying it to the model confusion matrices. The best performing model was then compared to a rule-based method. The best performing model was based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) classifier using a combination of unigrams and bigrams as tokens. Sentence frequency and attributes selection did not improve model performance. SMO achieved 98.14% accuracy and 0.981Ã¢â‚¬â€°F-score versus 79.32% and 0.756 for the rule-based model. A model using machine-learning algorithms to automatically classify patients' smoking status was successfully developed. Such algorithms may enable automatic assessment of smoking status and other unstructured data directly from EMRs without manual classification of complete case notes.","Caccamisi, JÃƒÂ¸rgensen, Dalianis, Rosenlund","https://doi.org/10.1080/03009734.2020.1792010","20201026","Clinical informatics; electronic medical records; machine learning; natural language processing; smoking; text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16464,""

"Spectrally Tunable Neural Network-Assisted Segmentation of Microneurosurgical Anatomy","Distinct tissue types are differentiated based on the surgeon's knowledge and subjective visible information, typically assisted with white-light intraoperative imaging systems. Narrow-band imaging (NBI) assists in tissue identification and enables automated classifiers, but many anatomical details moderate computational predictions and cause bias. In particular, tissues' light-source-dependent optical characteristics, anatomical location, and potentially hazardous microstructural changes such as peeling have been overlooked in previous literature. Narrow-band images of five (<i>n</i> = 5) facial nerves (FNs) and internal carotid arteries (ICAs) were captured from freshly frozen temporal bones. The FNs were split into intracranial and intratemporal samples, and ICAs' adventitia was peeled from the distal end. Three-dimensional (3D) spectral data were captured by a custom-built liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) spectral imaging (SI) system. We investigated the normal variance between the samples and utilized descriptive and machine learning analysis on the image stack hypercubes. Reflectance between intact and peeled arteries in lower-wavelength domains between 400 and 576 nm was significantly different (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Proximal FN could be differentiated from distal FN in a higher range, 490-720 nm (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). ICA with intact tunica differed from proximal FN nearly thorough the VIS range, 412-592 nm (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and 664-720 nm (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) as did its distal counterpart, 422-720 nm (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).

"Utility of SNOMED CT in automated expansion of clinical terms in discharge summaries: Testing issues of coverage","This study tests coverage of SNOMED CT as an expansion source in the process of automated expansion of clinical terms found in discharge summaries. Term expansion is commonly used as a technique in knowledge extraction, query formulation and semantic modelling among other applications. However, characteristics of the sources might affect credibility of outputs, and coverage is one of them. We developed an automated method for testing coverage of more than one source at a time. We used several methods to clean our corpus of discharge summaries before we extracted text fragments as candidates for clinical concepts. We then used Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) sources and UMLS REST API to filter concepts from the pool of text fragments. Statistical measures like true positive rate and false negative rate were used to decide on the coverage of the source. We also tested the coverage of the individual SNOMED CT hierarchies using the same methods. Findings suggest that a combination of four terminologies tested (SNOMED CT, NCI, LNC and MSH) achieves over 90% of coverage for term expansion. We also found that the SNOMED CT hierarchies that hold clinically relevant concepts provided 60% of coverage. We believe that our findings and the method we developed will be of use to both scientists and practitioners working in the domain of knowledge extraction.","Zivaljevic, Atalag, Warren","https://doi.org/10.1177/1833358320934528","20200721","SNOMED CT; health information management; patient discharge summaries; semantics; vocabulary","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16468,""
"Ginseng and Cancer-Related Fatigue: A Systematic Review of Clinical Trials","The data on the effect of ginseng on general fatigue were previously reviewed. However, there is limited data on the effect of various types of ginseng on cancer-related fatigue (CRF). CRF is one of the most pervasive symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment. The primary objective of the current study was to systematically review trials investigating the safety and efficacy of three different types of ginseng separately used in the treatment protocol for patients with CRF. We searched the available online databases for relevant publications up to October 2019. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager (RevMan, version 5.3) and reported the results in a narrative summary. A total of 210 studies were identified by the initial search, from which seven clinical trials and one retrospective study were included in this systematic review. A total of two clinical trials and one retrospective review examined the impact of <i>American ginseng</i> on CRF symptoms, three studies tested <i>Asian ginseng</i>, and two trials were conducted using <i>Korean ginseng</i>. The quality of the selected studies varied greatly. All three types of ginseng were tolerated well with few low-grade adverse events. <i>American ginseng</i>, containing more than 5% ginsenosides, consumed at the dosage of 2000Ã¢â‚¬â€°mg/day for up to eight weeks significantly reduced fatigue. <i>Asian ginseng</i>, containing Ã¢â€°Â¥ 7% ginsenosides, relieved symptoms of fatigue at the dosage of 400Ã¢â‚¬â€°mg/day in the majority of patients with CRF. <i>Korean ginseng</i>, consumed at the dosage of 3000Ã¢â‚¬â€°mg/day for 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks, decreased symptoms of CRF. Although our findings support the safety and effectiveness of ginseng in the treatment of CRF, the number of high-quality studies is not adequate to adopt ginseng as a standard treatment option for CRF.","Sadeghian, Rahmani, Zendehdel, Hosseini, Zare Javid","https://doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2020.1795691","20200721","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16469,""
"A deep learning method for real-time intraoperative US image segmentation in prostate brachytherapy","This paper addresses the detection of the clinical target volume (CTV) in transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) image-guided intraoperative for permanent prostate brachytherapy. Developing a robust and automatic method to detect the CTV on intraoperative TRUS images is clinically important to have faster and reproducible interventions that can benefit both the clinical workflow and patient health. We present a multi-task deep learning method for an automatic prostate CTV boundary detection in intraoperative TRUS images by leveraging both the low-level and high-level (prior shape) information. Our method includes a channel-wise feature calibration strategy for low-level feature extraction and learning-based prior knowledge modeling for prostate CTV shape reconstruction. It employs CTV shape reconstruction from automatically sampled boundary surface coordinates (pseudo-landmarks) to detect the low-contrast and noisy regions across the prostate boundary, while being less biased from shadowing, inherent speckles, and artifact signals from the needle and implanted radioactive seeds. The proposed method was evaluated on a clinical database of 145 patients who underwent permanent prostate brachytherapy under TRUS guidance. Our method achieved a mean accuracy of [Formula: see text] and a mean surface distance error of [Formula: see text]. Extensive ablation and comparison studies show that our method outperformed previous deep learning-based methods by more than 7% for the Dice similarity coefficient and 6.9 mm reduced 3D Hausdorff distance error. Our study demonstrates the potential of shape model-based deep learning methods for an efficient and accurate CTV segmentation in an ultrasound-guided intervention. Moreover, learning both low-level features and prior shape knowledge with channel-wise feature calibration can significantly improve the performance of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation.","Girum, Lalande, Hussain, CrÃƒÂ©hange","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02231-x","20200812","Convolutional neural networks; Image segmentation; Image-guided brachytherapy; Intraoperative; Shape models; Transrectal ultrasound","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16470,""
"Walking-related digital mobility outcomes as clinical trial endpoint measures: protocol for a scoping review","Advances in wearable sensor technology now enable frequent, objective monitoring of real-world walking. Walking-related digital mobility outcomes (DMOs), such as real-world walking speed, have the potential to be more sensitive to mobility changes than traditional clinical assessments. However, it is not yet clear which DMOs are most suitable for formal validation. In this review, we will explore the evidence on discriminant ability, construct validity, prognostic value and responsiveness of walking-related DMOs in four disease areas: Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and proximal femoral fracture. Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework for scoping reviews will guide study conduct. We will search seven databases (Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, IEEE Digital Library and Cochrane Library) and grey literature for studies which (1) measure differences in DMOs between healthy and pathological walking, (2) assess relationships between DMOs and traditional clinical measures, (3) assess the prognostic value of DMOs and (4) use DMOs as endpoints in interventional clinical trials. Two reviewers will screen each abstract and full-text manuscript according to predefined eligibility criteria. We will then chart extracted data, map the literature, perform a narrative synthesis and identify gaps. As this review is limited to publicly available materials, it does not require ethical approval. This work is part of Mobilise-D, an Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking which aims to deliver, validate and obtain regulatory approval for DMOs. Results will be shared with the scientific community and general public in cooperation with the Mobilise-D communication team.

"Evaluation of discrete orthogonal versus polar Stockwell Transform for local multi-resolution texture analysis using brain MRI of multiple sclerosis patients","The Stockwell Transform has the potential to perform multi-resolution texture analysis in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, it is computationally intensive and memory demanding. The polar Stockwell Transform (PST) is rotation-invariant and relatively memory efficient, but still computationally demanding. The new Discrete Orthogonal Stockwell Transform (DOST) appears to have addressed both the computation and storage challenges; however, its utility in localized texture analysis remains unclear. Our goal was to investigate the theory and texture analysis ability of the DOST versus PST using both synthetic and MR images, and explore the relative importance of the associated texture features using a simple classification example based on clinical brain MRI of six multiple sclerosis patients. MRI texture analysis focused on FLAIR images, and the classification used a machine learning algorithm, random forest, that differentiated regions of interest (ROIs) into 2 classes: white matter lesions, and the contralateral normal-appearing white matter (control). Our results showed that the PST features had a greater ability in detecting subtle changes in image structure than the DOST and polar-index DOST (PDOST). Quantitatively, based on 187 lesion and 187 control ROIs, both the PST and the rotation-invariant radial PST performed better in the classification than the DOST and PDOST, where the latter were no better than guessing (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.65 and 0.98). Further analysis using a hierarchical random forest showed that combining MRI signal intensity with the PST or DOST predictions increased the classification performance, with the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity all improved to &gt;85% in the tests. Collectively, the DOST is less competitive than the PST in localized image texture analysis. The PST features may help with texture-based lesion classification in MS based on clinical brain MRI scans following further verification.","Pridham, Oladosu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mri.2020.07.007","20201020","Discrete Orthogonal Stockwell Transform; Lesion; MRI texture analysis; Machine learning; Multiple sclerosis; Polar Stockwell Transform","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16472,""
"Adversarial active learning for the identification of medical concepts and annotation inconsistency","Named entity recognition (NER) is a principal task in the biomedical field and deep learning-based algorithms have been widely applied to biomedical NER. However, all of these methods that are applied to biomedical corpora use only annotated samples to maximize their performances. Thus, (1) large numbers of unannotated samples are relinquished and their values are overlooked. (2) Compared with other types of active learning (AL) algorithms, generative adversarial learning (GAN)-based AL methods have developed slowly. Furthermore, current diversity-based AL methods only compute similarities between a pair of sentences and cannot evaluate distribution similarities between groups of sentences. Annotation inconsistency is one of the significant challenges in the biomedical annotation field. Most existing methods for addressing this challenge are statistics-based or rule-based methods. (3) They require sufficient expert knowledge and complex designs. To address challenges (1), (2), and (3) simultaneously, we propose innovative algorithms. GAN is introduced in this paper, and we propose the GAN-bidirectional long short-term memory-conditional random field (GAN-BiLSTM-CRF) and the GAN-bidirectional encoder representations from transformers-conditional random field (GAN-BERT-CRF) models, which can be considered an NER model, an AL model, and a model identifying error labels. BiLSTM-CRF or BERT-CRF is defined as the generator and a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based network is considered the discriminator. (1) The generator employs unannotated samples in addition to annotated samples to maximize NER performance. (2) The outputs of the CRF layer and the discriminator are used to select unlabeled samples for the AL task. (3) The discriminator discriminates the distribution of error labels from that of correct labels, identify error labels, and address the annotation inconsistency challenge. The corpus from the 2010 i2b2/VA NLP challenge and the Chinese CCKS-2017 Task 2 dataset are adopted for experiments. Compared to the baseline BiLSTM-CRF and BERT-CRF, the GAN-BiLSTM-CRF and GAN-BERT-CRF models achieved significant improvements on the precision, recall, and F1 scores in terms of NER performance. Learning curves in AL experiments show the comparative results of the proposed models. Furthermore, the trained discriminator can identify samples with incorrect medical labels in both simulation and real-word experimental environments. The idea of introducing GAN contributes significant results in terms of NER, active learning, and the ability to identify incorrect annotated samples. The benefits of GAN will be further studied.","Yu, Yang, Wang, Zhen, He, Li, Zhao, Shu, Shu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103481","20200824","Active learning; Annotation inconsistency; Clinical natural language processing; Generative adversarial nets; Named entity recognition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16473,""
"Telling a Complicated Grief: A Psychodynamic Study on Mental Health Nurses' Countertransference Reactions to Patients' Suicidal Behavior","A key element of suicide education, training and clinical supervision is enhancing emotional awareness about mental health professionals' countertransference reactions, as emotional responses to patients' suicidal behavior (SB) that may be unbeneficial to care. This study aimed to explore emotional responses to patients' SB in mental health nurses (MHNs) according to a psychodynamic perspective. Twenty-eight Italian MHNs (61% females, Mage = 52Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) were interviewed to examine their deep feelings about attempted suicides or deaths by suicide of patients with mental illness. Computer-aided thematic analysis was performed on the verbatim transcribed interviews, adopting Emotional Text Analysis (ETA) as a research framework to explore affective symbolizations underlying narratives, beyond intentional and explicitly reported contents. Some statistical multidimensional techniques were carried out, allowing th.e detection of shared symbolic domains (Cluster Analysis) and latent factors organizing the contraposition between them (Multiple Correspondence Analysis). Five symbolic domains emerged which were respectively referred to as: hyper-vigilance (21.97% of the overall textual corpus), resentment (17.86%), rationalization (34.50%), resignation (5.54%) and mourning (20.12%). Four latent factors explained the overall data variance: strive for reparation (F1), lack of control (F2), ambivalence toward care (F3) and complicated grief (F4). Some clinical recommendations were derived suggesting to balance issues of risk assessment/management and staff's reflective practice, to work on the subjective sense of hopelessness resulting from turning against oneself the hostility evoked by patients, to consider rationalization processes and implicit beliefs leading to risk underestimation and to address some basic conflicts contributing to a complicated grief in mourning suicidal events.","Caputo","https://doi.org/10.1080/13811118.2020.1768990","20200720","Countertransference; mental health; nurse; suicide; text analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16474,""

PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Embase databases, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Wanfang database, the China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and the VIP database were searched to identify relevant systematic reviews. The reviews which assessed exercise interventions on cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in breast cancer patients were included. Quality of evidence was evaluated by the Grade of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. The Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) appraisal tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of included systematic reviews. Twenty-four systematic reviews metÃ‚Â all the inclusion criteria. The overall mean score for AMSATR is 7.38 and ranged from 4 to 10 points. In addition, 21 reviews arrived at positive conclusions, which exercises could reduce CRF, and 3 obtained that exercise does not affect fatigue. As for GRADE, 8 of the reviews were graded as 'moderate', 2 of the studies were 'very low', and the others were 'low'. Aerobic and resistance exercise can be regarded as beneficial to CRF in breast cancer patients, and limited evidence exists that yoga had an effect on reducing fatigue. The quality of the current systematic review is still far from satisfactory.","Jiang, Ma, Yun, Wang, Huang, Han","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnss.2020.03.001","20200928","Breast neoplasms; Exercise; Fatigue; Yoga","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16475,""

"Medical data science in rhinology: Background and implications for clinicians","An important challenge of big data is using complex information networks to provide useful clinical information. Recently, machine learning, and particularly deep learning, has enabled rapid advances in clinical practice. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in rhinology is an increasingly relevant topic. We review the literature and provide a detailed overview of the recent advances in AI and ML as applied to rhinology. Also, we discuss both the significant benefits of this work as well as the challenges in the implementation and acceptance of these methods for clinical purposes. We aimed to identify and explain published studies on the use of AI and ML in rhinology based on PubMed, Scopus, and Google searches. The search string &quot;nasal OR respiratory AND artificial intelligence OR machine learning&quot; was used. Most of the studies covered areas of paranasal sinuses radiology, including allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinitis, computed tomography scans, and nasal cytology. Cluster analysis and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were mainly used in studies related to rhinology. AI is increasingly affecting healthcare research, and ML technology has been used in studies of chronic rhinitis and allergic rhinitis, providing some exciting new research modalities. AI is especially useful when there is no conclusive evidence to aid decision making. ML can help doctors make clinical decisions, but it does not entirely replace doctors. However, when critically evaluating studies using this technique, rhinologists must take into account the limitations of its applications and use.","Jun, Jung, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102627","20200929","Artificial intelligence; Data science; Deep learning; Otolaryngology; Rhinitis; Sinusitis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16479,""
"Manual segmentation versus semi-automated segmentation forÃ‚Â quantifying vestibular schwannoma volume on MRI","Management of vestibular schwannoma (VS) is based on tumour size as observed on T1 MRI scans with contrast agent injection. The current clinical practice is to measure the diameter of the tumour in its largest dimension. It has been shown that volumetric measurement is more accurate and more reliable as a measure of VS size. The reference approach to achieve such volumetry is to manually segment the tumour, which is a time intensive task. We suggest that semi-automated segmentation may be a clinically applicable solution to this problem and that it could replace linear measurements as the clinical standard. Using high-quality software available for academic purposes, we ran a comparative study of manual versus semi-automated segmentation of VS on MRI with 5 clinicians and scientists. We gathered both quantitative and qualitative data to compare the two approaches; including segmentation time, segmentation effort and segmentation accuracy. We found that the selected semi-automated segmentation approach is significantly faster (167Ã‚Â s vs 479Ã‚Â s, [Formula: see text]), less temporally and physically demanding and has approximately equal performance when compared with manual segmentation, with some improvements in accuracy. There were some limitations, including algorithmic unpredictability and error, which produced more frustration and increased mental effort in comparison with manual segmentation. We suggest that semi-automated segmentation could be applied clinically for volumetric measurement of VS on MRI. In future, the generic software could be refined for use specifically for VS segmentation, thereby improving accuracy.","McGrath, Li, Dorent, Bradford, Saeed, Bisdas, Ourselin, Shapey, Vercauteren","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02222-y","20200820","Imaging; Machine learning; Neuroimaging; Segmentation; Vestibular schwannoma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16480,""

Electronic databases MEDLINE via OVID, Scopus and Web of Science were searched between October 2009 - April 2020. Tailored search-strings were developed using database-specific terms. Studies were selected using a strict inclusion criterion following PRISMA Guidelines. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using a tailored QUADAS-2 tool. Out of 315 records, 11 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. AI-based methods were employed for analysis of specific histological features for oral epithelial dysplasia (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1), oral submucous fibrosis (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5), oral squamous cell carcinoma (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4) and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1). A combination of heuristics, supervised and unsupervised learning methods were employed, including more than 10 different classification and segmentation techniques. Most studies used uni-centric datasets (range 40-270 images) comprising small sub-images within WSI with accuracy between 79 and 100%. This review provides early evidence to support the potential application of supervised machine learning methods as a diagnostic aid for some oral potentially malignant and malignant lesions; however, there is a paucity of evidence using AI for diagnosis of other head and neck pathologies. Overall, the quality of evidence is low, with most studies showing a high risk of bias which is likely to have overestimated accuracy rates.

"Greedy based convolutional neural network optimization for detecting apnea","Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder, usually diagnosed using an expensive, highly specialized, and inconvenient test called polysomnography. A single SpO2 sensor based on an automated classification system can be developed to simplify the apnea detection. The main objective of this work is to develop a classifier based on a convolution neural network with the capability of detecting apnea events from one dimensional SpO2 signal. However, to find an optimum convolution neural network structure is a daunting task is usually done by a trial-and-error method. To solve this problem, a method is proposed to save time and simplify the process of searching for an optimum convolution neural network structure. Greedy based optimization is proposed to search for an optimized convolution neural network structure. Three different variants of greedy based optimization are proposed: the topology transfer, the weighted-topology transfer with rough estimation, and the weighted-topology transfer with fine tuning. The subject independent and the cross-database test are performed for the analysis. Considering the balance between the execution time and the performance, the weighted-topology transfer with rough estimation is the best. An accuracy of 88.49% for the HuGCDN2008 database and 95.14% for the Apnea-ECG database are obtained for apnea events detection per minute. Regarding the apnea patient detection, also referred to as global classification, an accuracy of 95.71% is achieved for the HuGCDN2008 database, and 100% is achieved for the AED database without removing any subjects from both databases. The proposed one-dimensional convolution neural network performs better in a similar situation than those presented in the literature. The greedy based methods, mainly the weighted-topology transfer with rough estimation, is an alternative method to extensive trial and error method.","Mostafa, Baptista, Ravelo-GarcÃƒÂ­a, JuliÃƒÂ¡-SerdÃƒÂ¡, Morgado-Dias","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105640","20201012","CNN; Classification algorithms, sleep apnea; Hyperparameter; Optimization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16482,""
"Extraction of temporal relations from clinical free text: A systematic review of current approaches","Temporal relations between clinical events play an important role in clinical assessment and decision making. Extracting such relations from free text data is a challenging task because it lies on between medical natural language processing, temporal representation and temporal reasoning. To survey existing methods for extracting temporal relations (TLINKs) between events from clinical free text in English; to establish the state-of-the-art in this field; and to identify outstanding methodological challenges. A systematic search in PubMed and the DBLP computer science bibliography was conducted for studies published between January 2006 and December 2018. The relevant studies were identified by examining the titles and abstracts. Then, the full text of selected studies was analyzed in depth and information were collected on TLINK tasks, TLINK types, data sources, features selection, methods used, and reported performance. A total of 2834 publications were identified for title and abstract screening. Of these publications, 51 studies were selected. Thirty-two studies used machine learning approaches, 15 studies used a hybrid approaches, and only four studies used a rule-based approach. The majority of studies use publicly available corpora: THYME (28 studies) and the i2b2 corpus (17 studies). The performance of TLINK extraction methods ranges widely depending on relation types and events (e.g. from 32% to 87% F-score for identifying relations between clinical events and document creation time). A small set of TLINKs (before, after, overlap and contains) has been widely studied with relatively good performance, whereas other types of TLINK (e.g., started by, finished by, precedes) are rarely studied and remain challenging. Machine learning classifiers (such as Support Vector Machine and Conditional Random Fields) and Deep Neural Networks were among the best performing methods for extracting TLINKs, but nearly all the work has been carried out and tested on two publicly available corpora only. The field would benefit from the availability of more publicly available, high-quality, annotated clinical text corpora.","Alfattni, Peek, Nenadic","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103488","20200824","Clinical notes; Electronic health records; Natural language processing; Temporal information extraction; Temporal relation extraction; Text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16483,""
"Clinical and preclinical evidence of somatosensory involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron neurodegenerative disease. Although it has been classically considered as a disease limited to the motor system, there is increasing evidence for the involvement of other neural and non-neuronal systems. In this review, we will discuss currently existing literature regarding the involvement of the sensory system in ALS. Human studies have reported intradermic small fibre loss, sensory axonal predominant neuropathy, as well as somatosensory cortex hyperexcitability. In line with this, ALS animal studies have demonstrated the involvement of several sensory components. Specifically, they have highlighted the impairment of sensory-motor networks as a potential mechanism for the disease. The elucidation of these &quot;non-motor&quot; systems involvement, which might also be part of the degeneration process, should prompt the scientific community to re-consider ALS as a pure motor neuron disease, which may in turn result in more holistic research approaches.","Riancho, Paz-Fajardo, LÃƒÂ³pez de MunaÃƒÂ­n","https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15202","20200807","amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; clinical; preclinical; sensory disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16484,""

In 2016, a multidisciplinary team consisting of statisticians, data scientists, data engineers, and clinicians was assembled by the leadership of an academic health system to radically improve the detection and treatment of sepsis. This report of the quality improvement effort follows the learning health system framework to describe the problem assessment, design, development, implementation, and evaluation plan of Sepsis Watch. Sepsis Watch was successfully integrated into routine clinical care and reshaped how local machine learning projects are executed. Frontline clinical staff were highly engaged in the design and development of the workflow, machine learning model, and application. Novel machine learning methods were developed to detect sepsis early, and implementation of the model required robust infrastructure. Significant investment was required to align stakeholders, develop trusting relationships, define roles and responsibilities, and to train frontline staff, leading to the establishment of 3 partnerships with internal and external research groups to evaluate Sepsis Watch. Machine learning models are commonly developed to enhance clinical decision making, but successful integrations of machine learning into routine clinical care are rare. Although there is no playbook for integrating deep learning into clinical care, learnings from the Sepsis Watch integration can inform efforts to develop machine learning technologies at other health care delivery systems.","Sendak, Ratliff, Sarro, Alderton, Futoma, Gao, Nichols, Revoir, Yashar, Miller, Kester, Sandhu, Corey, Brajer, Tan, Lin, Brown, Engelbosch, Anstrom, Elish, Heller, Donohoe, Theiling, Poon, Balu, Bedoya, O'Brien","https://doi.org/10.2196/15182","20200928","change; deep learning; innovation, organizational; machine learning; sepsis; translational medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16485,""
"Exploring the Privacy-Preserving Properties of Word Embeddings: Algorithmic Validation Study","Word embeddings are dense numeric vectors used to represent language in neural networks. Until recently, there had been no publicly released embeddings trained on clinical data. Our work is the first to study the privacy implications of releasing these models. This paper aims to demonstrate that traditional word embeddings created on clinical corpora that have been deidentified by removing personal health information (PHI) can nonetheless be exploited to reveal sensitive patient information. We used embeddings created from 400,000 doctor-written consultation notes and experimented with 3 common word embedding methods to explore the privacy-preserving properties of each. We found that if publicly released embeddings are trained from a corpus anonymized by PHI removal, it is possible to reconstruct up to 68.5% (n=411/600) of the full names that remain in the deidentified corpus and associated sensitive information to specific patients in the corpus from which the embeddings were created. We also found that the distance between the word vector representation of a patient's name and a diagnostic billing code is informative and differs significantly from the distance between the name and a code not billed for that patient. Special care must be taken when sharing word embeddings created from clinical texts, as current approaches may compromise patient privacy. If PHI removal is used for anonymization before traditional word embeddings are trained, it is possible to attribute sensitive information to patients who have not been fully deidentified by the (necessarily imperfect) removal algorithms. A promising alternative (ie, anonymization by PHI replacement) may avoid these flaws. Our results are timely and critical, as an increasing number of researchers are pushing for publicly available health data.","Abdalla, Abdalla, Hirst, Rudzicz","https://doi.org/10.2196/18055","20200814","data anonymization; natural language processing; personal health records; privacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16486,""
"Effectiveness of Social Cognitive Theory-Based Interventions for Glycemic Control in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Protocol for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","For those living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), failing to engage in self-management behaviors leads to poor glycemic control. Social cognitive theory (SCT) has been shown to improve health behaviors by altering cognitive processes and increasing an individual's belief in their ability to accomplish a task. We aim to present a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis to systematically identify, evaluate, and analyze the effect of SCT-based interventions to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM. This protocol follows the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Data sources will include PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, and data will be reviewed with the use of customized text mining software. Studies examining SCT-based behavioral interventions for adults diagnosed with T2DM in randomized controlled trials located in the outpatient setting will be included. Intervention effectiveness will be compared with routine care. Screening and data collection will be performed in multiple stages with three reviewers as follows: (1) an independent review of titles/abstracts, (2) a full review, and (3) data collection with alternating teams of two reviewers for disputes to be resolved by a third reviewer. Study quality and risk of bias will be assessed by three reviewers using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Standardized mean differences will be used to describe the intervention effect sizes with regard to self-efficacy and diabetes knowledge. The raw mean difference of HbA1c will be provided in a random effects model and presented in a forest plot. The expected limitations of this study are incomplete data, the need to contact authors, and analysis of various types of glycemic control measures accurately within the same data set. This protocol was granted institutional review board exemption on October 7, 2019. PROSPERO registration (ID: CRD42020147105) was received on April 28, 2020. The review began on April 29, 2020. The results of the review will be disseminated through conference presentations, peer-reviewed journals, and meetings. This systematic review will appraise the effectiveness of SCT-based interventions for adults diagnosed with T2DM and provide the most effective interventions for improving health behaviors in these patients.

"Medical Insurance Information Systems in China: Mixed Methods Study","Since the People's Republic of China (PRC), or China, established the basic medical insurance system (MIS) in 1998, the medical insurance information systems (MIISs) in China have effectively supported the operation of the MIS through several phases of development; the phases included a stand-alone version, the internet, and big data. In 2018, China's national medical security systems were integrated, while MIISs were facing reconstruction. We summarized China's experience in medical insurance informatization over the past 20 years, aiming to provide a reference for the building of a new basic MIS for China and for developing countries. This paper aims to sort out medical insurance informatization policies throughout the years, use questionnaires to determine the status quo of provincial MIIS-building in China and the relevant policies, provide references and suggestions for the top-level design and implementation of the information systems in the transitional period of China's MIS reform, and provide a reference for the building of MIISs in developing countries. We conducted policy analysis by collecting the laws, regulations, and policy documents-issued from 1998 to 2020-on China's medical insurance and its informatization; we also analyzed the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and other relevant policies. We conducted a questionnaire survey by sending out questionnaires to 31 Chinese, provincial, medical security bureaus to collect information about network links, system functions, data exchange, standards and specifications, and building modes, among other items. We conducted a literature review by searching for documents about relevant laws and policies, building methods, application results, and other documents related to MIISs; we conducted searches using PubMed, Elsevier, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and other major literature databases. We conducted telephone interviews to verify the results of questionnaires and to understand the focus issues concerning the building of China's national MIISs during the period of integration and transition of China's MIS. In 74% (23/31) of the regions in China, MIISs were networked through dedicated fiber optic lines. In 65% (20/31) of the regions in China, MIISs supported identity recognition based on both ID cards and social security cards. In 55% (17/31) of the regions in China, MIISs at provincial and municipal levels were networked and have gathered basic medical insurance data, whereas MIISs were connected to health insurance companies in 35% (11/31) of the regions in China. China's MIISs are comprised of 11 basic functional modules, among which the modules of business operation, transregional referral, reimbursement, and monitoring systems are widely applied. MIISs in 83% (20/24) of Chinese provinces have stored data on coverage, payment, and settlement compensation of medical insurance. However, in terms of data security and privacy protection, pertinent policies are absent and data utilization is not in-depth enough. Respondents to telephone interviews universally reflected on the following issues and suggestions: in the period of integration and transition of MISs, close attention should be paid to the top-level design, and repeated investment should be avoided for the building of MIISs; MIISs should be adapted to the health care reform, and efforts should be made to strengthen the informatization support for the reform of payment methods; and MIISs should be adapted for the widespread application of mobile phones and should provide insured persons with more self-service functions. In the future, the building of China's basic MIISs should be deployed at the national, provincial, prefectural, and municipal levels on a unified basis. Efforts should be made to strengthen the development of standard codes, data exchange, and data utilization. Work should be done to formulate the rules and regulations for security and privacy protection and to balance the right to be informed with the mining and utilization of big data. Efforts should be made to intensify the interconnectivity between MISs and other health systems and to strengthen the application of medical insurance information in public health monitoring and early warning systems; this would ultimately improve the degree of trust from stakeholders, including individuals, medical service providers, and public health institutions, in the basic MIISs.","Li, Lu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.2196/18780","20201002","big data; health information exchange; information infrastructure; medical insurance; medical insurance information system; policy review; privacy protection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16488,""
"Machine Learning-Based Interpretation and Visualization of Nonlinear Interactions in Prostate Cancer Survival","Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values represent a unified approach to interpreting predictions made by complex machine learning (ML) models, with superior consistency and accuracy compared with prior methods. We describe a novel application of SHAP values to the prediction of mortality risk in prostate cancer. Patients with nonmetastatic, node-negative prostate cancer, diagnosed between 2004 and 2015, were identified using the National Cancer Database. Model features were specified a priori: age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, percent positive cores (PPC), comorbidity score, and clinical T stage. We trained a gradient-boosted tree model and applied SHAP values to model predictions. Open-source libraries in Python 3.7 were used for all analyses. We identified 372,808 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. When analyzing the interaction between PSA and Gleason score, we demonstrated consistency with the literature using the example of low-PSA, high-Gleason prostate cancer, recently identified as a unique entity with a poor prognosis. When analyzing the PPC-Gleason score interaction, we identified a novel finding of stronger interaction effects in patients with Gleason Ã¢â€°Â¥ 8 disease compared with Gleason 6-7 disease, particularly with PPC Ã¢â€°Â¥ 50%. Subsequent confirmatory linear analyses supported this finding: 5-year overall survival in Gleason Ã¢â€°Â¥ 8 patients was 87.7% with PPC &lt; 50% versus 77.2% with PPC Ã¢â€°Â¥ 50% (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), compared with 89.1% versus 86.0% in Gleason 7 patients (<i>P</i> &lt; .001), with a significant interaction term between PPC Ã¢â€°Â¥ 50% and Gleason Ã¢â€°Â¥ 8 (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). We describe a novel application of SHAP values for modeling and visualizing nonlinear interaction effects in prostate cancer. This ML-based approach is a promising technique with the potential to meaningfully improve risk stratification and staging systems.","Li, Shinde, Liu, Glaser, Lyou, Yuh, Wong, Amini","https://doi.org/10.1200/CCI.20.00002","20200716","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16489,""
"Harnessing repeated measurements of predictor variables for clinical risk prediction: a review of existing methods","Clinical prediction models (CPMs) predict the risk of health outcomes for individual patients. The majority of existing CPMs only harness cross-sectional patient information. Incorporating repeated measurements, such as those stored in electronic health records, into CPMs may provide an opportunity to enhance their performance. However, the number and complexity of methodological approaches available could make it difficult for researchers to explore this opportunity. Our objective was to review the literature and summarise existing approaches for harnessing repeated measurements of predictor variables in CPMs, primarily to make this field more accessible for applied researchers. MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science were searched for articles reporting the development of a multivariable CPM for individual-level prediction of future binary or time-to-event outcomes and modelling repeated measurements of at least one predictor. Information was extracted on the following: the methodology used, its specific aim, reported advantages and limitations, and software available to apply the method. The search revealed 217 relevant articles. Seven methodological frameworks were identified: time-dependent covariate modelling, generalised estimating equations, landmark analysis, two-stage modelling, joint-modelling, trajectory classification and machine learning. Each of these frameworks satisfies at least one of three aims: to better represent the predictor-outcome relationship over time, to infer a covariate value at a pre-specified time and to account for the effect of covariate change. The applicability of identified methods depends on the motivation for including longitudinal information and the method's compatibility with the clinical context and available patient data, for both model development and risk estimation in practice.","Bull, Lunt, Martin, Hyrich, Sergeant","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41512-020-00078-z","20200928","Clinical risk prediction; Dynamic prediction; Electronic health records; Joint models; Longitudinal data; Personalised medicine; Prediction models; Repeated observations; Survival analysis; Time-dependent covariates","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16490,""
"From Patient-Controlled Analgesia to Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Patient-Controlled Analgesia: Practices and Perspectives","Pain relief is a major concern for patients who have undergone surgery, and it is an eternal pursuit for anesthesiologists. However, postoperative pain management is far from satisfactory, though the past decades have witnessed great progress in the development of novel analgesics and analgesic techniques. A Cochrane systematic review showed that patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) achieved better pain relief and greater patient satisfaction than traditional &quot;on-demand&quot; parenteral analgesia, suggesting that it might be the manner of analgesia implementation that matters for effective postoperative pain management. A wireless intelligent PCA (Wi-PCA) system that incorporated remote monitoring, an intelligent alarm, intelligent analysis and assessment of the PCA equipment, as well as automatically recording and reserving key information functions under a wireless environment was introduced in our department in 2018. The practice showed that the Wi-PCA system significantly reduced the incidence of moderate to severe postoperative pain and relevant adverse effects, shortened hospital stays, and improved patient satisfaction with postoperative pain relief. Nevertheless, for both traditional and Wi-PCA, analgesics are only administered when pain occurs, leaving behind a realm of possibilities for better postoperative pain management. With the rapid development of machinery and deep learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the mode of clinical decision making. Integrating the big data collected by state-of-the-art monitoring sensors, the Internet of Things and AI algorithms, an AI-assisted PCA (Ai-PCA) may be a promising future direction for postoperative pain management.","Wang, Wang, Duan, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00145","20200928","Ai-PCA; Wi-PCA; artificial intelligence; patient-controlled analgesia; postoperative pain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16491,""
"Artificial Intelligence in Cardiovascular Imaging","The number of cardiovascular imaging studies is growing exponentially, and so is the need to improve clinical workflow efficiency and avoid missed diagnoses.

Current literature indicates that in the short-term, AI has the capacity to reduce human error and save time in the clinical workflow through automated segmentation of cardiac structures. In the future, AI may expand the informational value of diagnostic images based on images alone or a combination of images and clinical variables, thus facilitating disease detection, prognosis, and decision making.

"A Review of Default Mode Network Connectivity and Its Association With Social Cognition in Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder and Early-Onset Psychosis","Recent studies have demonstrated substantial phenotypic overlap, notably social impairment, between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of social impairments across these distinct neuropsychiatric disorders has not yet been fully examined. Most neuroimaging studies to date have focused on adults with these disorders, with little known about the neural underpinnings of social impairments in younger populations. Here, we present a narrative review of the literature available through April 2020 on imaging studies of adolescents with either ASD or early-onset psychosis (EOP), to better understand the shared and unique neural mechanisms of social difficulties across diagnosis from a developmental framework. We specifically focus on functional connectivity studies of the default mode network (DMN), as the most extensively studied brain network relevant to social cognition across both groups. Our review included 29 studies of DMN connectivity in adolescents with ASD (Mean age range = 11.2-21.6 years), and 14 studies in adolescents with EOP (Mean age range = 14.2-24.3 years). Of these, 15 of 29 studies in ASD adolescents found predominant underconnectivity when examining DMN connectivity. In contrast, findings were mixed in adolescents with EOP, with five of 14 studies reporting DMN underconnectivity, and an additional six of 14 studies reporting both under- and over-connectivity of the DMN. Specifically, intra-DMN networks were more frequently underconnected in ASD, but overconnected in EOP. On the other hand, inter-DMN connectivity patterns were mixed (both under- and over-connected) for each group, especially DMN connectivity with frontal, sensorimotor, and temporoparietal regions in ASD, and with frontal, temporal, subcortical, and cerebellar regions in EOP. Finally, disrupted DMN connectivity appeared to be associated with social impairments in both groups, less so with other features distinct to each condition, such as repetitive behaviors/restricted interests in ASD and hallucinations/delusions in EOP. Further studies on demographically well-matched groups of adolescents with each of these conditions are needed to systematically explore additional contributing factors in DMN connectivity patterns such as clinical heterogeneity, pubertal development, and medication effects that would better inform treatment targets and facilitate prediction of outcomes in the context of these developmental neuropsychiatric conditions.","Nair, Jolliffe, Lograsso, Bearden","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00614","20200928","autism spectrum disorder; default mode network; early-onset psychosis; functional connectivity; social cognition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16493,""
"Application of Support Vector Machine on fMRI Data as Biomarkers in Schizophrenia Diagnosis: A Systematic Review","Non-invasive measurements of brain function and structure as neuroimaging in patients with mental illnesses are useful and powerful tools for studying discriminatory biomarkers. To date, functional MRI (fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI) represent the most used techniques to provide multiple perspectives on brain function, structure, and their connectivity. Recently, there has been rising attention in using machine-learning (ML) techniques, pattern recognition methods, applied to neuroimaging data to characterize disease-related alterations in brain structure and function and to identify phenotypes, for example, for translation into clinical and early diagnosis. Our aim was to provide a systematic review according to the PRISMA statement of Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques in making diagnostic discrimination between SCZ patients from healthy controls using neuroimaging data from functional MRI as input. We included studies using SVM as ML techniques with patients diagnosed with Schizophrenia. From an initial sample of 660 papers, at the end of the screening process, 22 articles were selected, and included in our review. This technique can be a valid, inexpensive, and non-invasive support to recognize and detect patients at an early stage, compared to any currently available assessment or clinical diagnostic methods in order to save crucial time. The higher accuracy of SVM models and the new integrated methods of ML techniques could play a decisive role to detect patients with SCZ or other major psychiatric disorders in the early stages of the disease or to potentially determine their neuroimaging risk factors in the near future.","Steardo, Carbone, de Filippis, Pisanu, Segura-Garcia, Squassina, De Fazio, Steardo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00588","20200928","biomarkers; machine learning; resting-state fMRI; schizophrenia; support vector machine (SVM)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16494,""
"Neuroimaging and Neuropsychological Outcomes Following Clinician-Delivered Cognitive Training for Six Patients With Mild Brain Injury: A Multiple Case Study","Nearly half of all mild brain injury sufferers experience long-term cognitive impairment, so an important goal in rehabilitation is to address their multiple cognitive deficits to help them return to prior levels of functioning. Cognitive training, or the use of repeated mental exercises to enhance cognition, is one remediation method for brain injury. The primary purpose of this hypothesis-generating pilot study was to explore the statistical and clinical significance of cognitive changes and transfer of training to real-life functioning following 60 h of Brain Booster, a clinician-delivered cognitive training program, for six patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) or non-traumatic acquired brain injury (ABI). The secondary purpose was to explore changes in functional connectivity and neural correlates of cognitive test gains following the training. We used a multiple case study design to document significant changes in cognitive test scores, overall IQ score, and symptom ratings; and we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore trends in functional network connectivity and neural correlates of cognitive change. All cognitive test scores showed improvement with statistically significant changes on five of the seven measures (long-term memory, processing speed, reasoning, auditory processing, and overall IQ score). The mean change in IQ score was 20 points, from a mean of 108 to a mean of 128. Five themes emerged from the qualitative data analysis including improvements in cognition, mood, social identity, performance, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). With MRI, we documented significant region-to-region changes in connectivity following cognitive training including those involving the cerebellum and cerebellar networks. We also found significant correlations between changes in IQ score and change in white matter integrity of bilateral corticospinal tracts (CST) and the left uncinate fasciculus. This study adds to the growing body of literature examining the effects of cognitive training for mild TBI and ABI, and to the collection of research on the benefits of cognitive training in general. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02918994.","Moore, Carpenter, James, Miller, Moore, Disbrow, Ledbetter","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00229","20200928","LearningRx; MRI; brain injury; brain training; cognitive rehabilitation; cognitive training; concussion; mild TBI","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16495,""

"The association between neighbourhood characteristics and physical victimisation in men and women with mental disorders","How neighbourhood characteristics affect the physical safety of people with mental illness is unclear. To examine neighbourhood effects on physical victimisation towards people using mental health services. We developed and evaluated a machine-learning-derived free-text-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to ascertain clinical text referring to physical victimisation. This was applied to records on all patients attending National Health Service mental health services in Southeast London. Sociodemographic and clinical data, and diagnostic information on use of acute hospital care (from Hospital Episode Statistics, linked to Clinical Record Interactive Search), were collected in this group, defined as 'cases' and concurrently sampled controls. Multilevel logistic regression models estimated associations (odds ratios, ORs) between neighbourhood-level fragmentation, crime, income deprivation, and population density and physical victimisation. Based on a human-rated gold standard, the NLP algorithm had a positive predictive value of 0.92 and sensitivity of 0.98 for (clinically recorded) physical victimisation. A 1 s.d. increase in neighbourhood crime was accompanied by a 7% increase in odds of physical victimisation in women and an 13% increase in men (adjusted OR (aOR) for women: 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14, aOR for men: 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.21, P for gender interaction, 0.218). Although small, adjusted associations for neighbourhood fragmentation appeared greater in magnitude for women (aOR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.11) than men, where this association was not statistically significant (aOR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.95-1.04, P for gender interaction, 0.096). Neighbourhood income deprivation was associated with victimisation in men and women with similar magnitudes of association. Neighbourhood factors influencing safety, as well as individual characteristics including gender, may be relevant to understanding pathways to physical victimisation towards people with mental illness.","Bhavsar, Sanyal, Patel, Shetty, Velupillai, Stewart, Broadbent, MacCabe, Das-Munshi, Howard","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.52","20200928","Natural language processing; data linkage; electronic health records; neighbourhood characteristics; violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16497,""

"The use of surrounding rock loosening circle theory combined with elastic-plastic mechanics calculation method and depth learning in roadway support","The objective is to study the design method of roadway support and provide technical support for coal mining and other mining methods that need deep roadway excavation. Through literature review, the occurrence, development mechanism and influencing factors of surrounding loose rock zones of roadways are analyzed. A method of detecting is selected according to the characteristics of surrounding rock loosening. Knowledge of elastoplastic mechanics is used to theoretically study the failure mechanism of surrounding rock in deep re-mining roadways. Based on the artificial neural network prediction model (ANN), the surrounding rock is classified and a support network model of the decision system is constructed. After the design of roadway support, a sharp change of vault subsidence normally occurs within about 7 days after excavation, and the total subsidence is 14 mm. In the following month, deformation is slow, subsidence is small, and it is basically stable after one month. The curve of the vault subsidence rate shows that the vault subsidence rate is less than or equal to 1mm/d after 7 days. The convergence rate is also less than 1 mm/d after 7 days. There are two cave mouths AB and CD, and the convergence value of AB is 6.47mm, CD is 10.26mm: CD is slightly larger than AB, and it is close to stable one month later. It is essentially consistent with the time of vault settlement and stability, and the amount of deformation is approximately the same. This shows that, with the advance of the working face, the displacement of the surrounding rock in the section away from the working face will gradually decrease and the surrounding rock will be stable. The stability time of surrounding rock displacement of the portal section is the same as that of vault subsidence under the initial support, and the amount of deformation is approximately the same, indicating that the support parameters and construction methods are reasonable.","Xu, Li, Lu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234071","20200908","Coal Mining; Decision Support Techniques; Deep Learning; Elasticity; Engineering; Geological Phenomena; Landslides; Mechanical Phenomena; Pliability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16499,""
"Artificial intelligence to improve back pain outcomes and lessons learnt from clinical classification approaches: three systematic reviews","Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) could enhance the ability to detect patterns of clinical characteristics in low-back pain (LBP) and guide treatment. We conducted three systematic reviews to address the following aims: (a) review the status of AI/ML research in LBP, (b) compare its status to that of two established LBP classification systems (STarT Back, McKenzie). AI/ML in LBP is in its infancy: 45 of 48 studies assessed sample sizes &lt;1000 people, 19 of 48 studies used Ã¢â€°Â¤5 parameters in models, 13 of 48 studies applied multiple models and attained high accuracy, 25 of 48 studies assessed the binary classification of LBP versus no-LBP only. Beyond the 48 studies using AI/ML for LBP classification, no studies examined use of AI/ML in prognosis prediction of specific sub-groups, and AI/ML techniques are yet to be implemented in guiding LBP treatment. In contrast, the STarT Back tool has been assessed for internal consistency, test-retest reliability, validity, pain and disability prognosis, and influence on pain and disability treatment outcomes. McKenzie has been assessed for inter- and intra-tester reliability, prognosis, and impact on pain and disability outcomes relative to other treatments. For AI/ML methods to contribute to the refinement of LBP (sub-)classification and guide treatment allocation, large data sets containing known and exploratory clinical features should be examined. There is also a need to establish reliability, validity, and prognostic capacity of AI/ML techniques in LBP as well as its ability to inform treatment allocation for improved patient outcomes and/or reduced healthcare costs.","Tagliaferri, Angelova, Zhao, Owen, Miller, Wilkin, Belavy","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-020-0303-x","20200928","Muscle; Rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16500,""
"The utility of smartphone-based, ecological momentary assessment for depressive symptoms","Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating mood disorder. Individuals with MDD are often misdiagnosed or diagnosed in an untimely manner, exacerbating existing functional impairments. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves the repeated sampling of an individual's symptoms within their natural environment and has been demonstrated to assist in illness assessment and characterization. Capturing data in this way would set the stage for improved treatment outcomes and serve as a complementary resource in the management and treatment of depressive symptoms. Online databases PubMed/MedLine and PsycINFO were searched using PRISMA guidelines and combinations of the following keywords: EMA, depression, smartphone app, diagnosing, symptoms, phone, app, ecological momentary assessment, momentary assessment, data mining, unobtrusive, passive data, GPS, sensor. A total of nineteen original articles were identified using our search parameters and ten articles met the inclusion criteria for full-text review. Among the ten relevant studies, three studies evaluated feasibility, seven evaluated detection, and three evaluated treatment of MDD. Limitations include that the design of all of the studies included in this review are non-randomized. It should be noted that most of the studies included were pilot studies and/or exploratory trials lacking a control group. Available evidence suggests that the use of passive smartphone-based applications may lead to improved management of depressive symptoms. This review aids the creation of new EMA applications, highlights the potential of EMA usage in clinical settings and drug development, emphasizes the importance for regulation of applications in the mental health field, and provides insight into future directions.","Yim, Lui, Lee, Rosenblat, Ragguett, Park, Subramaniapillai, Cao, Zhou, Rong, Lin, Ho, Coles, Majeed, Wong, Phan, Nasri, McIntyre","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.116","20200715","Application; Ecological Momentary Assessment; Major Depressive Disorder; Passive Intervention; Smartphone; Unobtrusive","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16501,""

"Enhancing predictions of patient conveyance using emergency call handler free text notes for unconscious and fainting incidents reported to the London Ambulance Service","Pre-hospital emergency medical services use clinical decision support systems (CDSS) to triage calls. Call handlers often supplement this by making free text notes covering key incident information. We investigate whether machine learning approaches using features from such free text notes can improve prediction of unconscious patients who require conveyance. We analysed a subset of all London Ambulance Service calls that were triaged through the Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) as involving an unconscious or fainting patient in 2018. We use and compare two machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM). For each incident, we predict whether the patient will be conveyed to a hospital emergency department or equivalent using as features 1) the MPDS code, 2) the free text notes and 3) the two together. We evaluate model performance using the area under the curve (AUC) metric. Given the imbalance of outcomes (patient conveyed 71 %, not conveyed 29 %), we also consider sensitivity and specificity. Using only the MPDS code resulted in an AUC of 0.57. Using the text notes gave an improved AUC score of 0.63 and combining the two gave an AUC score of 0.64 (scores were similar for RF and GBM). GBM models scored better on sensitivity (0.93 vs 0.62 for RF in the combined model), but specificity was lower (0.17 vs. 0.56 for RF in the combined model). Using information contained in the free text notes made by call handlers in combination with MPDS improves prediction of unconscious and fainting patients requiring conveyance to a hospital emergency department (or equivalent) when compared with machine learning models using MPDS codes only. This suggests there is some useful information in unstructured data captured by emergency call handlers that complements MPDS codes. Quantifying this gain can help inform emergency medical service policy when evaluating the decision to expand or augment existing CDSS.","Tollinton, Metcalf, Velupillai","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104179","20201026","Clinical decision support; Emergency medical services; Machine learning; Medical Priority Dispatch System; Natural language processing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16503,""
"Artificial Intelligence for Caregivers of Persons With Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias: Systematic Literature Review","Artificial intelligence (AI) has great potential for improving the care of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and the quality of life of their family caregivers. To date, however, systematic review of the literature on the impact of AI on ADRD management has been lacking. This paper aims to (1) identify and examine literature on AI that provides information to facilitate ADRD management by caregivers of individuals diagnosed with ADRD and (2) identify gaps in the literature that suggest future directions for research. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for conducting systematic literature reviews, during August and September 2019, we performed 3 rounds of selection. First, we searched predetermined keywords in PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus with Full Text, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and the ACM Digital Library. This step generated 113 nonduplicate results. Next, we screened the titles and abstracts of the 113 papers according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, after which 52 papers were excluded and 61 remained. Finally, we screened the full text of the remaining papers to ensure that they met the inclusion or exclusion criteria; 31 papers were excluded, leaving a final sample of 30 papers for analysis. Of the 30 papers, 20 reported studies that focused on using AI to assist in activities of daily living. A limited number of specific daily activities were targeted. The studies' aims suggested three major purposes: (1) to test the feasibility, usability, or perceptions of prototype AI technology; (2) to generate preliminary data on the technology's performance (primarily accuracy in detecting target events, such as falls); and (3) to understand user needs and preferences for the design and functionality of to-be-developed technology. The majority of the studies were qualitative, with interviews, focus groups, and observation being their most common methods. Cross-sectional surveys were also common, but with small convenience samples. Sample sizes ranged from 6 to 106, with the vast majority on the low end. The majority of the studies were descriptive, exploratory, and lacking theoretical guidance. Many studies reported positive outcomes in favor of their AI technology's feasibility and satisfaction; some studies reported mixed results on these measures. Performance of the technology varied widely across tasks. These findings call for more systematic designs and evaluations of the feasibility and efficacy of AI-based interventions for caregivers of people with ADRD. These gaps in the research would be best addressed through interdisciplinary collaboration, incorporating complementary expertise from the health sciences and computer science/engineering-related fields.","Xie, Tao, Li, Hilsabeck, Aguirre","https://doi.org/10.2196/18189","20200928","Alzheimer disease; artificial intelligence; caregiving; dementia; technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16504,""
"[eHealth-smart devices revolutionizing cardiology]","The use of smart devices such as smartphones and smartwatches in cardiology continues to significantly increase. The widespread use is also promoted by patients and the industry. The goal is to assess different opportunities of smart devices in cardiology. A selected review of the literature was carried out. Scientific and clinical studies regarding possible applications of these devices were evaluated. The use of smartphones in Germany is among the highest worldwide. This allows very broad use of this technology in general and in the medical field. There are various potential applications ranging from a reference source over clinical decision support to biosignal sensing. Particularly, the combination of biosignal collection and interpretation by artificial intelligence could lead to a significant improvement of our diagnostic methods and precisely predict the course of various cardiovascular diseases.

"Bone shadow segmentation from ultrasound data for orthopedic surgery using GAN","Real-time, two (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) has been investigated as a potential alternative to fluoroscopy imaging in various surgical and non-surgical orthopedic procedures. However, low signal to noise ratio, imaging artifacts and bone surfaces appearing several millimeters (mm) in thickness have hindered the wide spread adaptation of this safe imaging modality. Limited field of view and manual data collection cause additional problems during US-based orthopedic procedures. In order to overcome these limitations various bone segmentation and registration methods have been developed. Acoustic bone shadow is an important image artifact used to identify the presence of bone boundaries in the collected US data. Information about bone shadow region can be used (1) to guide the orthopedic surgeon or clinician to a standardized diagnostic viewing plane with minimal artifacts, (2) as a prior feature to improve bone segmentation and registration. In this work, we propose a computational method, based on a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture, to segment bone shadow images from in vivo US scans in real-time. We also show how these segmented shadow images can be incorporated, as a proxy, to a multi-feature guided convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for real-time and accurate bone surface segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation studies are performed on 1235 scans collected from 27 subjects using two different US machines. Finally, we provide qualitative and quantitative comparison results against state-of-the-art GANs. We have obtained mean dice coefficient (Ã‚Â± standard deviation) of [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) for bone shadow segmentation, showing that the method is in close range with manual expert annotation. Statistical significant improvements against state-of-the-art GAN methods (paired t-test [Formula: see text]) is also obtained. Using the segmented bone shadow features average bone localization accuracy of 0.11Ã‚Â mm ([Formula: see text]) was achieved. Reported accurate and robust results make the proposed method promising for various orthopedic procedures. Although we did not investigate in this work, the segmented bone shadow images could also be used as an additional feature to improve accuracy of US-based registration methods. Further extensive validations are required in order to fully understand the clinical utility of the proposed method.","Alsinan, Patel, Hacihaliloglu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02221-z","20200812","Bone; Deep learning; Generative adversarial network; Orthopedic surgery; Segmentation; Ultrasound","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16506,""
"Synchrony Between Default-Mode and Sensorimotor Networks Facilitates Motor Function in Stroke Rehabilitation: A Pilot fMRI Study","Stroke is the most common cause of complex disability in Taiwan. After stroke onset, persistent physical practice or exercise in the rehabilitation procedure reorganizes neural assembly for reducing motor deficits, known as neuroplasticity. Neuroimaging literature showed rehabilitative effects specific to the brain networks of the sensorimotor network (SMN) and default-mode network (DMN). However, whether between-network interactions facilitate the neuroplasticity after stroke rehabilitation remains a mystery. Therefore, we conducted the longitudinal assessment protocol of stroke rehabilitation, including three types of clinical evaluations and two types of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques (resting state and grasp task). Twelve chronic stroke patients completed the rehabilitation protocol for at least 24 h and finished the three-time assessments: before, after rehabilitation, and 1 month after the cessation of rehabilitation. For comparison, age-matched normal controls (NC) underwent the same fMRI evaluation once without repeated measure. Increasing scores of the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) and upper extremity performance test reflected the enhanced motor performances after the stroke rehabilitation process. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) results showed that the connections between posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and iM1 were persistently enhanced in contrast to the pre-rehabilitation condition. The interactions between PCC and SMN were positively associated with motor performances. The enhanced cross-network connectivity facilitates the motor recovery after stroke rehabilitation, but the cross-network interaction was low before the rehabilitation process, similar to the level of NCs. Our findings suggested that cross-network connectivity plays a facilitatory role following the stroke rehabilitation, which can serve as a neurorehabilitative biomarker for future intervention evaluations.","Wu, Lin, Hsu, Yeh, Guu, Lee, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2020.00548","20200928","functional connectivity; motor; neuroplasticity; rehabilitation; resting-state functional MRI; stroke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16507,""
"Repurpose Open Data to Discover Therapeutics for COVID-19 Using Deep Learning","There have been more than 2.2 million confirmed cases and over 120Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 deaths from the human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), in the United States alone. However, there is currently a lack of proven effective medications against COVID-19. Drug repurposing offers a promising route for the development of prevention and treatment strategies for COVID-19. This study reports an integrative, network-based deep-learning methodology to identify repurposable drugs for COVID-19 (termed CoV-KGE). Specifically, we built a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes 15 million edges across 39 types of relationships connecting drugs, diseases, proteins/genes, pathways, and expression from a large scientific corpus of 24 million PubMed publications. Using Amazon's AWS computing resources and a network-based, deep-learning framework, we identified 41 repurposable drugs (including dexamethasone, indomethacin, niclosamide, and toremifene) whose therapeutic associations with COVID-19 were validated by transcriptomic and proteomics data in SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells and data from ongoing clinical trials. Whereas this study by no means recommends specific drugs, it demonstrates a powerful deep-learning methodology to prioritize existing drugs for further investigation, which holds the potential to accelerate therapeutic development for COVID-19.","Zeng, Song, Ma, Pan, Zhou, Hou, Zhang, Li, Karypis, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00316","20200813","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; deep learning; drug repurposing; knowledge graph; representation learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16508,""
"Improving Follow-up Attendance for Discharged Emergency Care Patients Using Automated Phone System to Self-schedule: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Automated phone appointment reminders have improved adherence with follow-up appointments in a variety of hospital settings, but have mixed results in patients discharged from the emergency department (ED). Increasing adherence to follow-up care has been a priority in the ED to improve patient outcomes and reduce unnecessary future visits. We conducted a prospective randomized open, blinded end-point (PROBE) trial of 278 adult patients discharged from the ED and referred to a provider for follow-up care. Participants in the intervention arm received a self-scheduling text or phone message that automatically connected them to their referral provider to schedule a follow-up appointment and sent them appointment reminders. Those in the control arm received standard-of-care written instructions to contact listed referral providers. The primary outcome was time to appointment. The secondary outcome was time to return visit to the ED. The automated reminders increased the cumulative incidence of keeping the referral appointment after ED discharge (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001, Gray's test). Of participants randomized to the automated phone intervention, 49.3% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 74) kept their follow-up appointment versus 23.4% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 30) in the control arm, with a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) over the duration of the study period of 2.4 (1.6 to 3.7; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). In a sensitivity analysis using 30Ã‚Â days of follow-up data, 42.0% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 63) of participants randomized to the phone intervention kept their follow-up versus 21.1% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 27) in the control arm, with a HR (95% CI) of 2.2 (1.4 to 3.5; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001).

"Going deeper through the Gleason scoring scale: An automatic end-to-end system for histology prostate grading and cribriform pattern detection","Prostate cancer is one of the most common diseases affecting men worldwide. The Gleason scoring system is the primary diagnostic and prognostic tool for prostate cancer. Furthermore, recent reports indicate that the presence of patterns of the Gleason scale such as the cribriform pattern may also correlate with a worse prognosis compared to other patterns belonging to the Gleason grade 4. Current clinical guidelines have indicated the convenience of highlight its presence during the analysis of biopsies. All these requirements suppose a great workload for the pathologist during the analysis of each sample, which is based on the pathologist's visual analysis of the morphology and organisation of the glands in the tissue, a time-consuming and subjective task. In recent years, with the development of digitisation devices, the use of computer vision techniques for the analysis of biopsies has increased. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the development of algorithms to automatically detect individual cribriform patterns belonging to Gleason grade 4 has not yet been studied in the literature. The objective of the work presented in this paper is to develop a deep-learning-based system able to support pathologists in the daily analysis of prostate biopsies. This analysis must include the Gleason grading of local structures, the detection of cribriform patterns, and the Gleason scoring of the whole biopsy. The methodological core of this work is a patch-wise predictive model based on convolutional neural networks able to determine the presence of cancerous patterns based on the Gleason grading system. In particular, we train from scratch a simple self-design architecture with three filters and a top model with global-max pooling. The cribriform pattern is detected by retraining the set of filters of the last convolutional layer in the network. Subsequently, a biopsy-level prediction map is reconstructed by bi-linear interpolation of the patch-level prediction of the Gleason grades. In addition, from the reconstructed prediction map, we compute the percentage of each Gleason grade in the tissue to feed a multi-layer perceptron which provides a biopsy-level score. In our SICAPv2 database, composed of 182 annotated whole slide images, we obtained a Cohen's quadratic kappa of 0.77 in the test set for the patch-level Gleason grading with the proposed architecture trained from scratch. Our results outperform previous ones reported in the literature. Furthermore, this model reaches the level of fine-tuned state-of-the-art architectures in a patient-based four groups cross validation. In the cribriform pattern detection task, we obtained an area under ROC curve of 0.82. Regarding the biopsy Gleason scoring, we achieved a quadratic Cohen's Kappa of 0.81 in the test subset. Shallow CNN architectures trained from scratch outperform current state-of-the-art methods for Gleason grades classification. Our proposed model is capable of characterising the different Gleason grades in prostate tissue by extracting low-level features through three basic blocks (i.e. convolutional layer + max pooling). The use of global-max pooling to reduce each activation map has shown to be a key factor for reducing complexity in the model and avoiding overfitting. Regarding the Gleason scoring of biopsies, a multi-layer perceptron has shown to better model the decision-making of pathologists than previous simpler models used in the literature.","Silva-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Colomer, Sales, Molina, Naranjo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105637","20200915","Convolutional neural networks; Cribriform; Deep learning; Gleason; Prostate cancer; Whole side images","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16510,""
"Cross-network interactions in social cognition: A review of findings on task related brain activation and connectivity","Theory of Mind, empathy, and action observation are central themes in social neuroscience research. Meta-analyses of functional neuroimaging studies show substantial heterogeneity in brain activation for these cognitive abilities, depending on the type of experimental task used. We followed up on these findings by a comparison to basic connectivity networks of the brain. In particular, we evaluated to what extent brain activation for social cognition tasks draws on areas of different fMRI resting-state networks (e.g., Default Mode, Ventral Attention Network) in parallel. Our review illustrates high prevalence of such network co-recruitments across Theory of Mind, empathy, and action observation tasks. To characterize these observations in more detail, we additionally conducted a literature review of fMRI effective connectivity studies. Findings reveal two main types of cross-network interactions in social cognition tasks: Negative coupling (segregation) between Default Mode and Control Networks (Ventral Attention, Frontoparietal, and Dorsal Attention Network), and positive coupling (integration) between these networks. The two patterns reflect different types of brain network organization taking place in the context of social cognition tasks-segregation for specialized, versus integration for flexible processing. We discuss evidence from connectivity research in other research fields, suggesting that increased network integration indicates more effortful and controlled processing. Based on that, we consider how findings of network segregation versus integration can provide new perspectives on dual-system accounts of social cognition, which differentiate between automatic and controlled processes. Moreover, we discuss how the reviewed evidence relates to neural processes which are assumed to take place during naturalistic social cognition.","Schurz, Maliske, Kanske","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2020.05.006","20200821","Across-network; Action observation; Between-network; Connectivity; Empathy; Mentalizing; Resting-state; Theory of Mind; fMRI","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16511,""
"FDG-PET/CT Radiomics Models for The Early Prediction of Loco-regional Recurrence in Head and Neck Cancer","Purpose Both CT and PET radiomics is considered as a potential prognostic biomarker in head and neck cancer. This study investigate the value of fused pre-treatment functional imaging (18F-FDG PET/CT) radiomics for modeling of local recurrence of head and neck cancers. Firstly, 298 patients is divided into a training set (n = 192) and verification set (n = 106). Secondly, PETs and CTs are fused based on wavelet transform. Thirdly, radiomics features are extracted from the 3D tumor area from PETCT fusion. The training set is used to select the features reduction and predict local recurrence, and the random forest prediction models combining radiomics and clinical variables are constructed. Finally, the ROC curve and K-M analysis are used to evaluate the prediction efficiency of the model on the validation set. Two PET / CT fusion radiomics features and three clinic parameters are extracted to construct the radiomics model. AUC value in the verification set 0.70 is better than no fused sets 0.69. The accuracy of 0.66 is not the highest value (0.67). Either consistency index CI 0.70 (from 0.67 to 0.70) or the p-value 0.025 (from 0.03 to 0.025) get the best result in all four models. The radiomics model based on the fusion of PETCT is better than the model based on PET or CT alone in predicting local recurrence, the inclusion of clinical parameters may result in more accurate predictions, which has certain guiding significance for the development of personalized precise treatment scheme.","Cong, Peng, Tian, ValliÃƒÂ¨res, Chuanpei, Aijun, Benxin","https://doi.org/10.2174/1573405616666200712181135","20200712","FDG-PET and CT fusion; Head and NeckCancer ; Local recurrence; outcome prediction; radiomics; texture analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16512,""
"Predicting the rate constants of semivolatile organic compounds with hydroxyl radicals and ozone in indoor air","Semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in air can react with hydroxyl radicals (OH), nitrate radicals (NO<sub>3</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Two questions regarding SVOC reactivity with OH, NO<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in the gas and particle phases remain to be addressed: according to the existing measurements in the literature, which are the most reactive SVOCs in air, and how can the SVOC reactivity in the gas and particle phases be predicted? In the present study, a literature review of the second-order rate constant (k) was carried out to determine the SVOC reactivity with OH, NO<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> in the gas and particle phases in ambient and indoor air at room temperature. Measured k values were available in the literature for 90 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organophosphates, dioxins, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and pesticides including pyrifenox, carbamates and terbuthylazine. PAHs and organophosphates were found to be more reactive than dioxins and PCBs. Based on the obtained data, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were developed to predict the k value using quantum chemical, molecular, physical property and environmental descriptors. Eight linear and nonlinear statistical models were employed, including regression models, bagging, random forest and gradient boosting. QSAR models were developed for SVOC/OH reactions in the gas and particle phases and SVOC/O<sub>3</sub> reactions in the particle phase. Models for SVOC/NO<sub>3</sub> and SVOC/O<sub>3</sub> reactions in the gas phase could not be developed due to the lack of measured k values for model training. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and random forest models were identified as the most effective models for SVOC reactivity prediction according to a comparison of model performance metrics.","Wei, Sivanantham, Malingre, Ramalho, Mandin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115050","20200915","Machine learning; QSAR model; Random forest; Reactivity; Regression; SVOC; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Hydroxyl Radical; Organic Chemicals; Ozone; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16513,""
"Data preprocessing for heart disease classification: A systematic literature review","Early detection of heart disease is an important challenge since 17.3 million people yearly lose their lives due to heart diseases. Besides, any error in diagnosis of cardiac disease can be dangerous and risks an individual's life. Accurate diagnosis is therefore critical in cardiology. Data Mining (DM) classification techniques have been used to diagnosis heart diseases but still limited by some challenges of data quality such as inconsistencies, noise, missing data, outliers, high dimensionality and imbalanced data. Data preprocessing (DP) techniques were therefore used to prepare data with the goal of improving the performance of heart disease DM based prediction systems. The purpose of this study is to review and summarize the current evidence on the use of preprocessing techniques in heart disease classification as regards: (1) the DP tasks and techniques most frequently used, (2) the impact of DP tasks and techniques on the performance of classification in cardiology, (3) the overall performance of classifiers when using DP techniques, and (4) comparisons of different combinations classifier-preprocessing in terms of accuracy rate. A systematic literature review is carried out, by identifying and analyzing empirical studies on the application of data preprocessing in heart disease classification published in the period between January 2000 and June 2019. A total of 49 studies were therefore selected and analyzed according to the aforementioned criteria. The review results show that data reduction is the most used preprocessing task in cardiology, followed by data cleaning. In general, preprocessing either maintained or improved the performance of heart disease classifiers. Some combinations such as (ANNÃ‚Â +Ã‚Â PCA), (ANNÃ‚Â +Ã‚Â CHI) and (SVMÃ‚Â +Ã‚Â PCA) are promising terms of accuracy. However the deployment of these models in real-world diagnosis decision support systems is subject to several risks and limitations due to the lack of interpretation.","Benhar, Idri, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-AlemÃƒÂ¡n","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105635","20200915","Cardiac datasets; Cardiology; Data preprocessing; Datamining; Literature review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16514,""
"Real-world big-data studies in laboratory medicine: Current status, application, and future considerations","With the recent developments in information technology, real world big data studies (RWBDSs) have attracted increasing attention in the field of medicine. In RWBDSs, clinical laboratory data is an important part of the wider scope of real-world medical data, and its standardized use is critical for the generation of high-quality real-world evidence. To improve the core functioning and competitiveness of clinical laboratories as well as provide high-quality medical services for patients, it is important to construct an information analysis model and perform RWBDSs. However, among the majority of developing countries, as well as in some developed countries, due to the poorly developed neglect of data formatting standards information construction and the lack of consideration for, and experience with, the ideas and methods of RWBDSs, many clinical laboratories are unable to make use of the vast amount of data stored in their systems. Additionally, in the literature, there remain many areas that require improvements, such as the correct misuse of research methods, appropriate unreasonable data presentation methods, and optimal opaque methods for data cleaning, storage, and mining. In this review, we describe both the advantages and disadvantages of RWBDSs in laboratory medicine. In addition, we summarize the current application and methods of RWBDS in laboratory medicine from seven different perspectives: the establishment of a reference interval, patient data-based real time quality control, diagnostic or prognostic modeling, epidemiological investigation, laboratory management, analysis of sources of variations for analytes, and external quality assessment. Finally, we discuss the future prospects of this research. This review can provide the basis for clinical laboratories to carry out real world research; additionally, it promotes and standardizes RWBDS in laboratory medicine.","Ma, Wang, Wu, Cheng, Xia, Xue, Qiu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2020.06.014","20200918","Big data; Data mining; Diagnostic and prognostic models; Epidemiological survey; Quality control; Real-world study; Reference interval; Sources of variations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16515,""
"[Impact of hysterectomy on urinary incontinence: A systematic review]","The impact of a hysterectomy on urinary incontinence is a controversial subject in the literature. To evaluate the prevalence and incidence of urinary incontinence after a hysterectomy as well as associated risk factors such as the type of hysterectomy, the surgical approach, urodynamic criteria and uterine disease. We conducted a systematic review in Pubmed database with the following keywords and MeSH term: hysterectomy, urinary incontinence. A total of 1340 articles were retrieved, 42 articles were selected for the final text analysis. The results of the different studies were heterogeneous. Hysterectomy seemed to increase the rate of sphincter deficiency (VLPP&lt;60mmH<sub>2</sub>O for 20% of cases versus 1,7% without hysterectomy, P=0.003). The vaginal route could increase the incidence of UI with OR of 2.3 (95%CI 1.0-5.2). Subtotal hysterectomy appears to increase UI with a 0,74 RR for total hysterectomy (95%CI 0.58-0.94). A radical hysterectomy with nerve conservation would preserve urinary functions, unlike pelvic radiotherapy, which is responsible for irreversible nerve damage by demyelination and bladder fibrosis.","Harendarczyk, Cardaillac, Vaucel, Joueidi, Gueudry, Dochez, Thubert","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.purol.2020.06.002","20200711","Chirurgie; Hysterectomy; HystÃƒÂ©rectomie; Incontinence urinaire; Lower urinary tract symptoms; Surgery; Troubles urinaires du bas appareil; Urinary incontinence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16516,""
"Workforce Shortage for Retinopathy of Prematurity Care and Emerging Role of Telehealth and Artificial Intelligence","Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is the leading cause of childhood blindness in very-low-birthweight and very preterm infants in the United States. With improved survival of smaller babies, more infants are at risk for ROP, yet there is an increasing shortage of providers to screen and treat ROP. Through a literature review of new and emerging technologies, screening criteria, and analysis of a national survey of pediatric ophthalmologists and retinal specialists, the authors found the shortage of ophthalmology workforce for ROP a serious and growing concern. When used appropriately, emerging technologies have the potential to mitigate gaps in the ROP workforce.","Barrero-Castillero, Corwin, VanderVeen, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcl.2020.04.012","20200903","Artificial intelligence; Neonatal intensive care unit; Premature infant; Retinopathy of prematurity; Telemedicine; Very-low-birthweight; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Neonatal Screening; Ophthalmologists; Retinopathy of Prematurity; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine; United States","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16517,""
"Validation of the effectiveness of a digital integrated healthcare platform utilizing an AI-based dietary management solution and a real-time continuous glucose monitoring system for diabetes management: a randomized controlled trial","Despite the numerous healthcare smartphone applications for self-management of diabetes, patients often fail to use these applications consistently due to various limitations, including difficulty in inputting dietary information by text search and inconvenient and non-persistent self-glucose measurement by home glucometer. We plan to apply a digital integrated healthcare platform using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based dietary management solution and a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) to overcome those limitations. Furthermore, medical staff will be performing monitoring and intervention to encourage continuous use of the program. The aim of this trial is to examine the efficacy of the program in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have HbA1c 53-69Ã¢â‚¬â€°mmol/mol (7.0-8.5%) and body mass index (BMI)Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°23Ã¢â‚¬â€°mg/m<sup>2</sup>. This is a 48-week, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial consisting of patients with type 2 diabetes. The patients will be randomly assigned to three groups: control group A will receive routine diabetes care; experimental group B will use the digital integrated healthcare platform by themselves without feedback; and experimental group C will use the digital integrated healthcare platform with continuous glucose monitoring and feedback from medical staff. There are five follow-up measures: baseline and post-intervention at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48. The primary end point is change in HbA1c from baseline to six months after the intervention. This trial will verify the effectiveness of a digital integrated healthcare platform with an AI-driven dietary solution and a real-time CGMS in patients with T2DM.

"Leveraging Bayesian networks and information theory to learn risk factors for breast cancer metastasis","Even though we have established a few risk factors for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) through epidemiologic studies, these risk factors have not proven to be effective in predicting an individual's risk of developing metastasis. Therefore, identifying critical risk factors for MBC continues to be a major research imperative, and one which can lead to advances in breast cancer clinical care. The objective of this research is to leverage Bayesian Networks (BN) and information theory to identify key risk factors for breast cancer metastasis from data. We develop the Markov Blanket and Interactive risk factor Learner (MBIL) algorithm, which learns single and interactive risk factors having a direct influence on a patient's outcome. We evaluate the effectiveness of MBIL using simulated datasets, and compare MBIL with the BN learning algorithms Fast Greedy Search (FGS), PC algorithm (PC), and CPC algorithm (CPC). We apply MBIL to learn risk factors for 5Ã¢â‚¬â€°year breast cancer metastasis using a clinical dataset we curated. We evaluate the learned risk factors by consulting with breast cancer experts and literature. We further evaluate the effectiveness of MBIL at learning risk factors for breast cancer metastasis by comparing it to the BN learning algorithms Necessary Path Condition (NPC) and Greedy Equivalent Search (GES). The averages of the Jaccard index for the simulated datasets containing 2000 records were 0.705, 0.272, 0.228, and 0.147 for MBIL, FGS, PC, and CPC respectively. MBIL, NPC, and GES all learned that grade and lymph_nodes_positive are direct risk factors for 5Ã¢â‚¬â€°year metastasis. Only MBIL and NPC found that surgical_margins is a direct risk factor. Only NPC found that invasive is a direct risk factor. MBIL learned that HER2 and ER interact to directly affect 5Ã¢â‚¬â€°year metastasis. Neither GES nor NPC learned that HER2 and ER are direct risk factors. The results involving simulated datasets indicated that MBIL can learn direct risk factors substantially better than standard Bayesian network learning algorithms. An application of MBIL to a real breast cancer dataset identified both single and interactive risk factors that directly influence breast cancer metastasis, which can be investigated further.","Jiang, Wells, Brufsky, Shetty, Shajihan, Neapolitan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-03638-8","20200820","Bayesian network; Breast cancer; Interaction; Metastasis; Risk factor; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Information Theory; Markov Chains; Neoplasm Metastasis; Risk Factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16519,""
"What Can Social Media Tell Us About Patient Symptoms: A Text-Mining Approach to Online Ovarian Cancer Forum","Ovarian cancer (OvCa) patients suffer from symptoms that severely affect quality of life. To optimally manage these symptoms, their symptom experiences must be better understood. Social media have emerged as a data source to understand these experiences. The objective of this study was to use topic modeling (ie, latent Dirichlet allocation [LDA]) to understand the symptom experience of OvCa patients through analysis of online forum posts from OvCa patients and their caregivers. Ovarian cancer patient/caregiver posts (n = 50 626) were collected from an online OvCa forum. We developed a symptom dictionary to identify symptoms described therein, selected the top 5 most frequently discussed symptoms, extracted posts that mentioned at least one of those symptoms, and conducted LDA on those extracted posts. Pain, nausea, anxiety, fatigue, and skin rash were the top 5 most frequently discussed symptoms (n = 4536, 1296, 967, 878, and 657, respectively). Using LDA, we identified 11 topic categories, which differed across symptoms. For example, chemotherapy-related adverse effects likely reflected fatigue, nausea, and rash; social and spiritual support likely reflected anxiety; and diagnosis and treatment often reflected pain. The frequency of a symptom discussed on a social media platform may not include all symptom experience and their severity. Indeed, users, who are experiencing different symptoms, mentioned different topics on the forum. Subsequent studies should consider the influence of additional factors (eg, cancer stage) from discussions. Social media have the potential to prioritize and answer the questions about clinical care that are frequently asked by cancer patients and their caregivers.","Lee, Park, Roberge, Donovan","https://doi.org/10.1097/NCC.0000000000000860","20200710","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16520,""
"Communication Behavior Changes Between Patients With Diabetes and Healthcare Providers Over 9 Years: Retrospective Cohort Study","Health organizations and patients interact over different communication channels and are harnessing digital communications for this purpose. Assisting health organizations to improve, adapt, and introduce new patient-health care practitioner communication channels (such as patient portals, mobile apps, and text messaging) enhances health care services access. This retrospective data study aims to assist health care administrators and policy makers to improve and personalize communication between patients and health care professionals by expanding the capabilities of current communication channels and introducing new ones. Our main hypothesis is that patient follow-up and clinical outcomes are influenced by their preferred communication channels with the health care organization. This study analyzes data stored in electronic medical records and logs documenting access to various communication channels between patients and a health organization (Clalit Health Services, Israel). Data were collected between 2008 and 2016 from records of 311,168 patients diagnosed with diabetes, aged 21 years and over, members of Clalit at least since 2007, and still alive in 2016. The analysis consisted of characterizing the use profiles of communication channels over time and used clustering for discretization purposes and patient profile building and then a hierarchical clustering and heatmaps to visualize the different communication profiles. A total of 13 profiles of patients were identified and characterized. We have shown how the communication channels provided by the health organization influence the communication behavior of patients. We observed how different patients respond differently to technological means of communication and change or don't change their communication patterns with the health care organization based on the communication channels available to them. Identifying the channels of communication within the health organization and which are preferred by each patient creates an opportunity to convey messages adapted to the patient in the most appropriate way. The greater the likelihood that the therapeutic message is received by the patient, the greater the patient's response and proactiveness to the treatment will be.

"Discrimination of Low-Energy Acetabular Fractures from Controls Using Computed Tomography-Based Bone Characteristics","The incidence of low-energy acetabular fractures has increased. However, the structural factors for these fractures remain unclear. The objective of this study was to extract trabecular bone architecture and proximal femur geometry (PFG) measures from clinical computed tomography (CT) images to (1) identify possible structural risk factors of acetabular fractures, and (2) to discriminate fracture cases from controls using machine learning methods. CT images of 107 acetabular fracture subjects (25 females, 82 males) and 107 age-gender matched controls were examined. Three volumes of interest, one at the acetabulum and two at the femoral head, were extracted to calculate bone volume fraction (BV/TV), gray-level co-occurrence matrix and histogram of the gray values (GV). The PFG was defined by neck shaft angle and femoral neck axis length. Relationships between the variables were assessed by statistical mean comparisons and correlation analyses. Bayesian logistic regression and Elastic net machine learning models were implemented for classification. We found lower BV/TV at the femoral head (0.51 vs. 0.55, p = 0.012) and lower mean GV at both the acetabulum (98.81 vs. 115.33, p &lt; 0.001) and femoral head (150.63 vs. 163.47, p = 0.005) of fracture subjects when compared to their matched controls. The trabeculae within the femoral heads of the acetabular fracture sides differed in structure, density and texture from the corresponding control sides of the fracture subjects. Moreover, the PFG and trabecular architectural variables, alone and in combination, were able to discriminate fracture cases from controls (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve 0.70 to 0.79). In conclusion, lower density in the acetabulum and femoral head with abnormal trabecular structure and texture at the femoral head, appear to be risk factors for low-energy acetabular fractures.","Gebre, Hirvasniemi, Lantto, Saarakkala, Leppilahti, JÃƒÂ¤msÃƒÂ¤","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10439-020-02563-4","20200710","Acetabular fracture; Computed tomography; Gray-level co-occurrence matrix; Machine learning; Trabecular structure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16522,""
"Radiomics in radiation oncology-basics, methods, and limitations","Over the past years, the quantity and complexity of imaging data available for the clinical management of patients with solid tumors has increased substantially. Without the support of methods from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, aÃ‚Â complete evaluation of the available image information is hardly feasible in clinical routine. Especially in radiotherapy planning, manual detection and segmentation of lesions is laborious, time consuming, and shows significant variability among observers. Here, AI already offers techniques to support radiation oncologists, whereby ultimately, the productivity and the quality are increased, potentially leading to an improved patient outcome. Besides detection and segmentation of lesions, AI allows the extraction of aÃ‚Â vast number of quantitative imaging features from structural or functional imaging data that are typically not accessible by means of human perception. These features can be used alone or in combination with other clinical parameters to generate mathematical models that allow, for example, prediction of the response to radiotherapy. Within the large field of AI, radiomics is the subdiscipline that deals with the extraction of quantitative image features as well as the generation of predictive or prognostic mathematical models. This review gives an overview of the basics, methods, and limitations of radiomics, with aÃ‚Â focus on patients with brain tumors treated by radiation therapy.","Lohmann, Bousabarah, Hoevels, Treuer","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00066-020-01663-3","20201026","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Machine learning; Multiparametric positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI); Radiotherapy; Textural features","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16523,""
"Determining the effectiveness of peer-assisted learning in medical education: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Despite the popularity of peer-assisted learning (PAL), existing literature has not shown enough evidence that can validate its impact on students' active learning. This meta-analysis aims to quantitatively analyse the effectiveness of PAL in medical education. We searched selected databases using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms 'peer-assisted', 'learning', 'active learning', 'teaching strategy', 'peer mentoring', and 'peer instructions' for full-text English language studies with a pre-post design. Following a systematic protocol, we selected 11 articles for final analysis. A meta-analysis was done using Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3 from Cochrane Training and the final output was presented by a forest plot. The results showed a significant effectiveness of PAL; notably, there was a standardised mean difference of 1.26 with a confidence interval of 0.58-1.94. The Cochran's Q test showed a 5% level of significance as measured by Chi<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 449.46. Besides, the results of the I<sup>2</sup> test were significant (98%); moreover, a z value of 3.65 validated the effectiveness of PAL. This research has shown that PAL can be used as a valuable learning tool in the medical field. Educational interventions in curricula for incorporating PAL strategies can potentially enhance the learning experience of the medical students.

"Systematic review of artificial intelligence techniques in the detection and classification of COVID-19 medical images in terms of evaluation and benchmarking: Taxonomy analysis, challenges, future solutions and methodological aspects","This study presents a systematic review of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques used in the detection and classification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) medical images in terms of evaluation and benchmarking. Five reliable databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus were used to obtain relevant studies of the given topic. Several filtering and scanning stages were performed according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria to screen the 36 studies obtained; however, only 11 studies met the criteria. Taxonomy was performed, and the 11 studies were classified on the basis of two categories, namely, review and research studies. Then, a deep analysis and critical review were performed to highlight the challenges and critical gaps outlined in the academic literature of the given subject. Results showed that no relevant study evaluated and benchmarked AI techniques utilised in classification tasks (i.e. binary, multi-class, multi-labelled and hierarchical classifications) of COVID-19 medical images. In case evaluation and benchmarking will be conducted, three future challenges will be encountered, namely, multiple evaluation criteria within each classification task, trade-off amongst criteria and importance of these criteria. According to the discussed future challenges, the process of evaluation and benchmarking AI techniques used in the classification of COVID-19 medical images considered multi-complex attribute problems. Thus, adopting multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is an essential and effective approach to tackle the problem complexity. Moreover, this study proposes a detailed methodology for the evaluation and benchmarking of AI techniques used in all classification tasks of COVID-19 medical images as future directions; such methodology is presented on the basis of three sequential phases. Firstly, the identification procedure for the construction of four decision matrices, namely, binary, multi-class, multi-labelled and hierarchical, is presented on the basis of the intersection of evaluation criteria of each classification task and AI classification techniques. Secondly, the development of the MCDA approach for benchmarking AI classification techniques is provided on the basis of the integrated analytic hierarchy process and VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje methods. Lastly, objective and subjective validation procedures are described to validate the proposed benchmarking solutions.","Albahri, Zaidan, Albahri, Zaidan, Abdulkareem, Al-Qaysi, Alamoodi, Aleesa, Chyad, Alesa, Kem, Lakulu, Ibrahim, Rashid","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.06.028","20201013","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; COVID-19; Decision-making; Evaluation; MCDA; Medical image; Artificial Intelligence; Benchmarking; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Decision Support Techniques; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiography, Thoracic; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16525,""
"Enhanced character-level deep convolutional neural networks for cardiovascular disease prediction","Electronic medical records contain a variety of valuable medical information for patients. So, when we are able to recognize and extract risk factors for disease from EMRs of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), and are able to use them to predict CVD, we have the ability to automatically process clinical texts, resulting in an improved accuracy of supporting doctors for the clinical diagnosis of CVD. In the case where CVD is becoming more worldwide, predictive CVD based on EMRs has been studied by many researchers to address this important aspect of improving diagnostic efficiency. This paper proposes an Enhanced Character-level Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (EnDCNN) model for cardiovascular disease prediction. On the manually annotated Chinese EMRs corpus, our risk factor identification extraction model achieved 0.9073 of F-score, our prediction model achieved 0.9516 of F-score, and the prediction result is better than the most previous methods. The character-level model based on text region embedding can well map risk factors and their labels as a unit into a vector, and downsampling plays a crucial role in improving the training efficiency of deep CNN. What's more, the shortcut connections with pre-activation used in our model architecture implements dimension-matching free in training.","Zhang, Qiu, Yang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-1118-z","20200826","CVD prediction; CVD risk factors extraction; Chinese electronic medical record; Dimension-matching free; Downsampling; Pre-activation; Text region embedding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16526,""
"Identifying diagnosis evidence of cardiogenic stroke from Chinese echocardiograph reports","Cardiogenic stroke has increasing morbidity in China and brought economic burden to patient families. In cardiogenic stroke diagnosis, echocardiograph examination is one of the most important examinations. Sonographers will investigate patients' heart via echocardiograph, and describe them in the echocardiograph reports. In this study, we developed a machine learning model to automatically identify diagnosis evidences of cardiogenic stroke providing to neurologist for clinical decision making. We collected 4188 Chinese echocardiograph reports of 4018 patients, with average length 177 Chinese characters in free-text style. Collaborating with neurologists and sonographers, we summarized 149 phrases on diagnosis evidence of cardiogenic stroke such as &quot; (severe mitral stenosis), &quot; (aortic valve degeneration) and so on. Furthermore, we developed an annotated corpus via mapping 149 phrases to the 4188 reports. We selected 11 most frequent diagnosis evidence types such as &quot; (mitral stenosis) for further identifying. The generated corpus is divided into training set and testing set in the ratio of 8:2, which is used to train and validate a machine learning model to identify the evidence of cardiogenic stroke using BiLSTM-CRF algorithm. Our machine learning method achieved the average performance on the diagnosis evidence identification is 98.03, 90.17 and 93.94% respectively. In addition, our method is capable to identify the novel diagnosis evidence of cardiogenic stroke description such as &quot;-&quot; (mitral stenosis), &quot; (aortic valve calcification) et al. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we analyze the structure of the echocardiograph reports and summarized 149 phrases on diagnosis evidence of cardiogenic stroke. We use the phrases to generate an annotated corpus automatically, which greatly reduces the cost of manual annotation. The model trained based on the corpus also has a good performance on the testing set. The method of automatically identifying diagnosis evidence of cardiogenic stroke proposed in this study will be further refined in the practice.","Qin, Xu, Ding, Li, Li","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-1106-3","20200826","BiLSTM-CRF; Cardiogenic stroke; Chinese echocardiograph reports; Diagnosis evidences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16527,""
"Fine-tuning ERNIE for chest abnormal imaging signs extraction","Chest imaging reports describe the results of chest radiography procedures. Automatic extraction of abnormal imaging signs from chest imaging reports has a pivotal role in clinical research and a wide range of downstream medical tasks. However, there are few studies on information extraction from Chinese chest imaging reports. In this paper, we formulate chest abnormal imaging sign extraction as a sequence tagging and matching problem. On this basis, we propose a transferred abnormal imaging signs extractor with pretrained ERNIE as the backbone, named EASON (fine-tuning ERNIE with CRF for Abnormal Signs ExtractiON), which can address the problem of data insufficiency. In addition, to assign the attributes (the body part and degree) to corresponding abnormal imaging signs from the results of the sequence tagging model, we design a simple but effective tag2relation algorithm based on the nature of chest imaging report text. We evaluate our method on the corpus provided by a medical big data company, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant and consistent improvement compared to other baselines.","Li, Ren","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103492","20200824","Chest Abnormal imaging signs extraction; Conditional random field; ERNIE; Sequence tagging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16528,""
"Collaborative, Multidisciplinary Evaluation of Cancer Variants Through Virtual Molecular Tumor Boards Informs Local Clinical Practices","The cancer research community is constantly evolving to better understand tumor biology, disease etiology, risk stratification, and pathways to novel treatments. Yet the clinical cancer genomics field has been hindered by redundant efforts to meaningfully collect and interpret disparate data types from multiple high-throughput modalities and integrate into clinical care processes. Bespoke data models, knowledgebases, and one-off customized resources for data analysis often lack adequate governance and quality control needed for these resources to be clinical grade. Many informatics efforts focused on genomic interpretation resources for neoplasms are underway to support data collection, deposition, curation, harmonization, integration, and analytics to support case review and treatment planning. In this review, we evaluate and summarize the landscape of available tools, resources, and evidence used in the evaluation of somatic and germline tumor variants within the context of molecular tumor boards. Molecular tumor boards (MTBs) are collaborative efforts of multidisciplinary cancer experts equipped with genomic interpretation resources to aid in the delivery of accurate and timely clinical interpretations of complex genomic results for each patient, within an institution or hospital network. Virtual MTBs (VMTBs) provide an online forum for collaborative governance, provenance, and information sharing between experts outside a given hospital network with the potential to enhance MTB discussions. Knowledge sharing in VMTBs and communication with guideline-developing organizations can lead to progress evidenced by data harmonization across resources, crowd-sourced and expert-curated genomic assertions, and a more informed and explainable usage of artificial intelligence. Advances in cancer genomics interpretation aid in better patient and disease classification, more streamlined identification of relevant literature, and a more thorough review of available treatments and predicted patient outcomes.","Rao, Pitel, Wagner, Boca, McCoy, King, Gupta, Park, Warner, Chen, Rogan, Chakravarty, Griffith, Griffith, Madhavan","https://doi.org/10.1200/CCI.19.00169","20200924","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16529,""
"[Clinical application characteristics of different acupuncture-moxibustion therapies for knee osteoarthritis in the past decade: an analysis based on data mining techniques]","To investigate the application characteristics of different acupuncture-moxibusition (acu-moxi) therapies for knee osteoarthritis (KOA), and to provide a reference for clinical application. Computer and data mining techniques were used to establish a database of acu-moxi therapies for KOA, and the articles on acu-moxi in the treatment of KOA in the past decade were collected, screened, entered, reviewed, and analyzed. Acu-moxi therapies for KOA were summarized in terms of treatment method, clinical effect, association between treatment method and acupoint selection, needle specifications, and depth of acupuncture. There are as many as 46 kinds of operation methods to treat knee osteoarthritis, among which moxibustion method has the highest frequency and the most operation methods. Traditional Chinese acupuncture and moxibustion technology has a significant effect on knee osteoarthritis, and the effective rate is more than 90%, among which the minimally invasive technique of traditional Chinese medicine has the highest cure rate and recovery rate. The relationship between traditional Chinese medicine operation and acupoint selection shows that the acupuncture and moxibustion therapy guided by traditional Chinese medicine theory pays more attention to acupoint selection based on syndrome differentiation, while the minimally invasive technique of traditional Chinese medicine is mostly proximal acupoint selection. The diameter of the needle with the highest usage frequency was 0.3 mm. The larger the diameter of the needle, the higher the specificity. The level of acupuncture was mostly tendon, followed by bone. The cure rate of acupuncture to bone is the highest. Acupuncture and moxibustion has a significant effect in the treatment of KOA, with a profound theoretical basis; treatment of KOA should emphasize overall conditioning, and acupuncture should reach the bone and the tendon, so as to achieve a better clinical effect.","Wang, Chen, Liu, Zhang, Jia, Xu, Pan, Jia","https://doi.org/10.13702/j.1000-0607.190360","20200901","Acupuncture and moxibustion technique; Clinical effect; Data mining; Knee osteoarthritis; Literature research; Acupuncture Points; Data Mining; Humans; Moxibustion; Osteoarthritis, Knee","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16530,""
"AI in Radiology: Where are we today in Multiple Sclerosis Imaging?","Ã¢â‚¬â€šMR imaging is an essential component in managing patients with Multiple sclerosis (MS). This holds true for the initial diagnosis as well as for assessing the clinical course of MS.Ã¢â‚¬Å In recent years, a growing number of computer tools were developed to analyze imaging data in MS.Ã¢â‚¬Å This review gives an overview of the most important applications with special emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI). Ã¢â‚¬â€šRelevant studies were identified through a literature search in recognized databases, and through parsing the references in studies found this way. Literature published as of November 2019 was included with a special focus on recent studies from 2018 and 2019. Ã¢â‚¬â€šThere are a number of studies which focus on optimizing lesion visualization and lesion segmentation. Some of these studies accomplished these tasks with high accuracy, enabling a reproducible quantitative analysis of lesion loads. Some studies took a radiomics approach and aimed at predicting clinical endpoints such as the conversion from a clinically isolated syndrome to definite MS.Ã¢â‚¬Å Moreover, recent studies investigated synthetic imaging, i.Ã¢â‚¬Å e. imaging data that is not measured during an MR scan but generated by a computer algorithm to optimize the contrast between MS lesions and brain parenchyma. Ã¢â‚¬â€šComputer-based image analysis and AI are hot topics in imaging MS.Ã¢â‚¬Å Some applications are ready for use in clinical routine. A major challenge for the future is to improve prediction of expected disease courses and thereby helping to find optimal treatment decisions on an individual level. With technical improvements, more questions arise about the integration of new tools into the radiological workflow. Ã¢â‚¬â€š Ã‚Â· Computer algorithms have a growing impact on analyzing MR imaging in MS.. Ã‚Â· Artificial intelligence is more and more commonly employed in such computer tools.. Ã‚Â· Applications include lesion segmentation, prediction of clinical parameters and image synthesizing.. Ã‚Â· Eichinger P, Zimmer C, Wiestler B.

Ã¢â‚¬â€šMRT-Untersuchungen sind ein zentraler Baustein in der Diagnostik bei Multipler Sklerose (MS). Dies gilt sowohl fÃƒÂ¼r das Erstereignis wie auch fÃƒÂ¼r die Verlaufsbeurteilung. In den vergangenen Jahren wurden zunehmend Algorithmen zur Analyse von MRT-Daten bei MS entwickelt. Diese ÃƒÅ“bersichtsarbeit stellt die wesentlichen Anwendungsfelder unter besonderer BerÃƒÂ¼cksichtigung von Algorithmen aus dem Bereich der KÃƒÂ¼nstlichen Intelligenz (KI) vor. Ã¢â‚¬â€šRelevante Studien wurden durch eine Literatursuche in anerkannten Datenbanken sowie durch Querverweise in so gefundenen Studien identifiziert. Dabei wurde Literatur berÃƒÂ¼cksichtigt, die bis November 2019 erschienen war, ein besonderes Augenmerk lag auf kÃƒÂ¼rzlich erschienenen Studien aus den Jahren 2018 und 2019. Ã¢â‚¬â€šViele Studien haben LÃƒÂ¶sungen zur optimierten LÃƒÂ¤sionsvisualisierung oder der Segmentierung von LÃƒÂ¤sionen entwickelt. Hier liegen bereits Werkzeuge vor, die diese Aufgaben mit hoher Genauigkeit bewerkstelligen kÃƒÂ¶nnen und damit mittelbar eine reproduzierbare, quantitative Auswertung der LÃƒÂ¤sionslast ermÃƒÂ¶glichen. Einige Arbeiten gingen einem Radiomics-Ansatz nach und untersuchten die Vorhersage klinischer Endpunkte, z.Ã¢â‚¬Å B. die Konversion von einem klinisch isolierten Syndrom zu definitiver MS.Ã¢â‚¬Å Zuletzt liegen erste Arbeiten vor, die synthetisch erstellte Bildgebung untersuchen, also solche Bilder, die basierend auf tatsÃƒÂ¤chlich gemessenen MRT-Sequenzen von Maschinenlernalgorithmen generiert werden und die Kontraste zwischen LÃƒÂ¤sionen und normalem Hirnparenchym optimieren. Ã¢â‚¬â€šComputerunterstÃƒÂ¼tzte Bildanalyse und KI sind hochaktuelle Themen in der MS-Bildgebung. Einzelne Anwendungen sind dabei bereits jetzt prinzipiell in der klinischen Routine einsetzbar. Eine wesentliche Herausforderung fÃƒÂ¼r die Zukunft besteht vor allem darin, bessere PrÃƒÂ¤diktionen klinischer VerlÃƒÂ¤ufe und entsprechende Hilfestellungen in der Findung einer optimalen Therapie auf patientenindividueller Ebene bereitzustellen.

The inclusion criteria for objective 1 were all publication results yielded from the searches. All English papers that had a 'PDF' option from the search results were included for objective 2. A sample of the 'PDF' English papers were included for objective 3. All 116 female patients from the BCCD, consisting of 64 positive BC patients and 52 controls were included in the study for objective 2. For the WBCD, all 699 female patients comprising of 458 with a benign BC tumour and 241 with a malignant BC tumour were included for objective 3. All 2928 publications were included for objective 1. The results showed that the United States of America (USA) produced the highest number of publications (n=803). In total, 2419 first authors contributed towards the publications. Breast Cancer Research and Treatment was the highest ranked journal. Institutional collaborations mainly occurred within the USA. The use of ML for BC screening and detection was the most researched topic. A total of 19 distinct papers were included for objectives 2 and 3. The findings from these studies were never presented to clinicians for validations. In conclusion, the use of ML for BC screening and detection is promising.","Salod, Singh","https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2020.1772","20200928","Breast cancer; blood tests; cancer screening; fine needle aspiration; machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16532,""
"Path to precision: prevention of post-operative atrial fibrillation","Development of post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) following open-heart surgery is a significant clinical and economic burden. Despite advancements in medical therapies, the incidence of POAF remains elevated at 25-40%. Early work focused on detecting arrhythmias from electrocardiograms as well as identifying pre-operative risk factors from medical records. However, further progress has been stagnant, and a deeper understanding of pathogenesis and significant influences is warranted. With the advent of more complex machine learning (ML) algorithms and high-throughput sequencing, we have an unprecedented ability to capture and predict POAF in real-time. Integration of multimodal heterogeneous data and application of ML can generate a paradigm shift for diagnosis and treatment. This will require a concerted effort to consolidate and streamline real-time data. Herein, we will review the current literature and emerging opportunities aimed at predictive targets and new insights into the mechanisms underlying long-term sequelae of POAF.","Skaria, Parvaneh, Zhou, Kim, Wanjiru, Devers, Konhilas, Khalpey","https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-19-3875","20200928","Post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF); deep learning; machine learning (ML)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16533,""
"Neural side effect discovery from user credibility and experience-assessed online health discussions","Health 2.0 allows patients and caregivers to conveniently seek medical information and advice via e-portals and online discussion forums, especially regarding potential drug side effects. Although online health communities are helpful platforms for obtaining non-professional opinions, they pose risks in communicating unreliable and insufficient information in terms of quality and quantity. Existing methods in extracting user-reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in online health forums are not only insufficiently accurate as they disregard user credibility and drug experience, but are also expensive as they rely on supervised ground truth annotation of individual statement. We propose a NEural ArchiTecture for Drug side effect prediction (NEAT), which is optimized on the task of drug side effect discovery based on a complete discussion while being attentive to user credibility and experience, thus, addressing the mentioned shortcomings. We train our neural model in a self-supervised fashion using ground truth drug side effects from mayoclinic.org. NEAT learns to assign each user a score that is descriptive of their credibility and highlights the critical textual segments of their post. Experiments show that NEAT improves drug side effect discovery from online health discussion by 3.04% from user-credibility agnostic baselines, and by 9.94% from non-neural baselines in term of F<sub>1</sub>. Additionally, the latent credibility scores learned by the model correlate well with trustworthiness signals, such as the number of &quot;thanks&quot; received by other forum members, and improve credibility heuristics such as number of posts by 0.113 in term of Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Experience-based self-supervised attention highlights critical phrases such as mentioned side effects, and enhances fully supervised ADR extraction models based on sequence labelling by 5.502% in terms of precision. NEAT considers both user credibility and experience in online health forums, making feasible a self-supervised approach to side effect prediction for mentioned drugs. The derived user credibility and attention mechanism are transferable and improve downstream ADR extraction models. Our approach enhances automatic drug side effect discovery and fosters research in several domains including pharmacovigilance and clinical studies.","Nguyen, Sugiyama, Kan, Halder","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13326-020-00221-1","20200715","Credibility analysis; Deep learning; Drug side effect discovery; Natural language processing; Online health communities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16534,""

"Comparative Effects Between Direct Oral Anticoagulants for Acute Venous Thromboembolism: Indirect Comparison From Randomized Controlled Trials","<b>Background:</b> There is no direct comparison from clinical trials amongst the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), leaving an evidence gap in decision-making regarding the choice of a DOAC. <b>Methods:</b> We performed a systematic review for an indirect comparison from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for comparative effects amongst DOACs in the patients with acute VTE. <b>Results:</b> A total of 16 RCTs were included for analyses, among which three for dabigatran (<i>n</i> = 7,963 patients), six rivaroxaban (<i>n</i> = 17,935), five apixaban (<i>n</i> = 12,823), and two edoxaban (<i>n</i> = 9,286). There was no significant difference in risk of recurrent VTE (evidence quality: low) and major bleeding (evidence quality: very low) for treatment effects between the four DOACs. Albeit non-significantly, apixaban seemed to have a lowest risk of major bleeding while rivaroxaban had a smallest risk of VTE. Although in general all the included trials were comparable, data from the included trials indicated that the assumption of transitivity may be challenged. Further methodological research including simulation studies, using a net-benefit or benefit-harm approach, running ranking probability analysis, and developing decision aids with machine-learning may be a worthwhile endeavor to help with the choice of DOACs in patients with acute VTE. <b>Conclusions:</b> To conclude, based on results from the indirect comparison no significant difference in the efficacy and safety was found among the DOACs in patients with acute VTE. More evidence from direct comparative trials is needed to further inform the choice of DOACs in patients with acute VTE.","Li, Zeng, Zhang, Thabane","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00280","20200928","comparative effect; direct oral anticoagulant; efficacy; major bleeding; safety; venous thromboembolism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16536,""
"Calibration and validation of accelerometry using cut-points to assess physical activity in paediatric clinical groups: A systematic review","Regular physical activity is associated with physiological and psychosocial benefits in both healthy and clinical populations. However, little is known about tailoring the analysis of physical activity using accelerometers to the specific characteristics of chronic conditions. Whilst accelerometry is broadly used to assess physical activity, recommendations on calibration in paediatric clinical groups are warranted. The aim of this systematic review was to provide a critical overview of protocols used to calibrate accelerometry in children and adolescents with clinical conditions, as well as to develop recommendations for calibration and validation of accelerometry in such populations. The search was performed between March to July 2017 using text words and subject headings in six databases. Studies had to develop moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) cut-points for paediatric clinical populations to be included. Risk of bias was assessed using a specific checklist. A total of 540,630 titles were identified, with 323 full-text articles assessed. Five studies involving 347 participants aged 9 to 15Ã‚Â years were included. Twenty-four MVPA cut-points were reported across seven clinical conditions, 16 of which were developed for different models of ActiGraph, seven for Actical and one for Tritrac-R3D. Statistical approaches included mixed regression, machine learning and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Disease-specific MVPA cut-points ranged from 152 to 735 countsÃ‚Â·15Ã‚Â s<sup>-1</sup>, with lower cut-points found for inherited muscle disease and higher cut-points associated with intellectual disabilities. The lower MVPA cut-points for diseases characterised by both ambulatory and metabolic impairments likely reflect the higher energetic demands associated with those conditions.","Bianchim, McNarry, Larun, Barker, Williams, Mackintosh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2020.101142","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16537,""
"Constructing knowledge graphs and their biomedical applications","Knowledge graphs can support many biomedical applications. These graphs represent biomedical concepts and relationships in the form of nodes and edges. In this review, we discuss how these graphs are constructed and applied with a particular focus on how machine learning approaches are changing these processes. Biomedical knowledge graphs have often been constructed by integrating databases that were populated by experts via manual curation, but we are now seeing a more robust use of automated systems. A number of techniques are used to represent knowledge graphs, but often machine learning methods are used to construct a low-dimensional representation that can support many different applications. This representation is designed to preserve a knowledge graph's local and/or global structure. Additional machine learning methods can be applied to this representation to make predictions within genomic, pharmaceutical, and clinical domains. We frame our discussion first around knowledge graph construction and then around unifying representational learning techniques and unifying applications. Advances in machine learning for biomedicine are creating new opportunities across many domains, and we note potential avenues for future work with knowledge graphs that appear particularly promising.","Nicholson, Greene","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.05.017","20201020","Lterature review; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Network embeddings; Text mining; knowledge graphs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16538,""
"Circular Economy on Construction and Demolition Waste: A Literature Review on Material Recovery and Production","Construction and demolition waste (CDW) accounts for at least 30% of the total solid waste produced around the world. At around 924 million tons in the European Union in 2016 and 2.36 billion tons in China in 2018, the amount is expected to increase over the next few years. Dumping these wastes in sanitary landfills has always been the traditional approach to waste management but this will not be feasible in the years to come. To significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of CDW being dumped, circular economy is a possible solution to the increasing amounts of CDW. Circular economy is an economic system based on business models which replaces the end-of-life concept with reducing, reusing, recycling, and recovering materials. This paper discusses circular economy (CE) frameworks-specifically material recovery and production highlighting the reuse and recycling of CDW and reprocessing into new construction applications. Likewise, a literature review into recent studies of reuse and recycling of CDW and its feasibility is also discussed to possibly prove the effectivity of CE in reducing CDW. Findings such as effectivity of recycling CDW into new construction applications and its limitations in effective usage are discussed and research gaps such as reuse of construction materials are also undertaken. CE and recycling were also found to be emerging topics. Observed trends in published articles as well as the use of latent Dirichlet allocation in creating topic models have shown a rising awareness and increasing research in CE which focuses on recycling and reusing CDW.","Ginga, Ongpeng, Daly","https://doi.org/10.3390/ma13132970","20200928","circular economy; construction; demolition; recycling; waste","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16539,""
"[The Importance of Different Topics in Medical Psychology/Sociology from Physicians' and Medical Students' View: Similarities and Differences]","The subject of &quot;Medical Psychology/Sociology&quot; is facing various content changes as a result of the currently pending study reforms within the framework of the &quot;Master Plan Medical Studies 2020&quot;. These include the further development of the catalogues of exam-relevant topics (GK) and the National Competence-Based Learning Objectives Catalogue for Undergraduate Medical Education (NKLM) as well as the Medical Licensing Regulations (Ãƒâ€žApprO). In this context, the question arises as to which training contents of &quot;medical psychology/sociology&quot;, that medical students are confronted with, are of particular importance for their future medical work. 332 physicians and 265 students evaluated different contents of the catalogue of exam-relevant topics of medical psychology/sociology (GK-MPS) according to their importance regarding their education or respectively their daily work. In addition, the physicians indicated in free text fields of the questionnaire which situations in their daily work they would have liked to have been better prepared for during medical school. In a combined quantitative-qualitative analysis approach, differences between the 2 groups were identified by t-tests for independent samples with unequal variances (Welch test) and free text information was assigned to the various topics of the GK-MPS and evaluated in terms of content by 3 raters within the framework of a qualitatively oriented category-based text analysis. Both physicians and students considered those topics of the GK-MPS, that involve communication between physician and patient, to be the most important. In addition, physicians rated the topics of physician-patient communication, statistics and prevention as more important than the students did. The physicians would have liked to have been better prepared for special and challenging medical situations in physician-patient interaction. The topics of physician-patient communication are still considered to be of particular importance for the medical training of physicians and students, but physicians consider them to be more important than students. The study results support the current study reforms towards a stronger emphasis on physician-patient communication and scientific basics as well as the linking of pre-clinical and clinical study contents.

"Functional imaging using radiomic features in assessment of lymphoma","Lymphomas are typically large, well-defined, and relatively homogeneous tumors, and therefore represent ideal targets for the use of radiomics. Of the available functional imaging tests, [18F]FDG-PET for body lymphoma and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) for central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma are of particular interest. The current literature suggests that two main applications for radiomics in lymphoma show promise: differentiation of lymphomas from other tumors, and lymphoma treatment response and outcome prognostication. In particular, encouraging results reported in the limited number of presently available studies that utilize functional imaging suggest that (1) MRI-based radiomics enables differentiation of CNS lymphoma from glioblastoma, and (2) baseline [18F]FDG-PET radiomics could be useful for survival prognostication, adding to or even replacing commonly used metrics such as standardized uptake values and metabolic tumor volume. However, due to differences in biological and clinical characteristics of different lymphoma subtypes and an increasing number of treatment options, more data are required to support these findings. Furthermore, a consensus on several critical steps in the radiomics workflow -most importantly, image reconstruction and post processing, lesion segmentation, and choice of classification algorithm- is desirable to ensure comparability of results between research institutions.","Mayerhoefer, Umutlu, SchÃƒÂ¶der","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2020.06.020","20200714","Artificial intelligence; Lymphoma; Magnetic resonance imaging; Positron emission tomography; Radiomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16541,""
"Cost-Utility Analysis of Prophylactic Dextrose Gel vs Standard Care for Neonatal Hypoglycemia in At-Risk Infants","To evaluate the long-term costs and impact on quality of life of using prophylactic dextrose gel in patients at increased risk of developing neonatal hypoglycemia. A cost-utility analysis was performed from the perspective of the health system, using a decision tree to model the long-term clinical outcomes of neonatal hypoglycemia, including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, vision disturbances, and learning disabilities, in patients at increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia who received prophylactic dextrose gel vs standard care. Model parameters including likelihoods of hypoglycemia and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, were based on the pre-Hypoglycemia Prevention with Oral Dextrose Study. Estimations of the likelihood of long-term condition(s), and their costs, were based on review of published literature. Patients who received prophylactic dextrose gel incurred costs to the health system of around US $14 000 over an 18-year time horizon, accruing 11.25 quality-adjusted life-years, whereas those who did not receive prophylactic treatment incurred cost of around $16 000 and experienced a utility of 11.10 quality-adjusted life-years. A prophylactic strategy of using dextrose gel in infants at increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia is likely to be cost effective compared with standard care, to reduce the direct costs to the health system over an 18-year time horizon, and improve quality of life.","Glasgow, Edlin, Harding","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.06.073","20200918","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16542,""

"Conventional Computed Tomographic Calcium Scoring vs full chest CTCS for lung cancer screening: a cost-effectiveness analysis","Conventional CTCS images the mid/lower chest for coronary artery disease (CAD). Because many CAD patients are also at risk for lung malignancy, CTCS often discovers incidental pulmonary nodules (IPN). CTCS excludes the upper chest, where malignancy is common. Full-chest CTCS (FCT) may be a cost-effective screening tool for IPN. A decision tree was created to compare a FCT to CTCS in a hypothetical patient cohort with suspected CAD. (Figure) The design compares the effects of missed cancers on CTCS with the cost of working up non-malignant nodules on FCT. The model was informed by results of the National Lung Screening Trial and literature review, including the rate of malignancy among patients receiving CTCS and the rate of malignancy in upper vs lower portions of the lung. The analysis outcomes are Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is generally considered beneficial when &lt;$50,000/QALY. Literature review suggests that rate of IPNs in the upper portion of the lung varied from 47 to 76%. Our model assumed that IPNs occur in upper and lower portions of the lung with equal frequency. The model also assumes an equal malignancy potential in upper lung IPNs despite data that malignancy occurs 61-66% in upper lung fields. In the base case analysis, a FCT will lead to an increase of 0.03 QALYs comparing to conventional CTCS (14.54 vs 14.51 QALY, respectively), which translates into an QALY increase of 16Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. The associated incremental cost for FCT is $278 ($1027 vs $748, FCT vs CTCS respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is $10,289/QALY, suggesting significant benefit. Sensitivity analysis shows this benefit increases proportional to the rate of malignancy in upper lung fields. Conventional CTCS may be a missed opportunity to screen for upper lung field cancers in high risk patients. The ICER of FCT is better than screening for breast cancer screening (mammograms $80Ã¢â‚¬â€°k/QALY) and colon cancer (colonoscopy $6Ã¢â‚¬â€°k/QALY). Prospective studies are appropriate to define protocols for FCT.","Jiang, Linden, Gupta, Jarrett, Worrell, Ho, Perry, Towe","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-020-01221-8","20200709","Conventional computed tomographic calcium scoring; Coronary artery disease; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Full chest calcium scoring scan; Lung cancer screening","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16545,""
"Diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence to detect genetic diseases with facial phenotypes: A protocol for systematic review and meta analysis","Many genetic diseases are known to have distinctive facial phenotypes, which are highly informative to provide an opportunity for automated detection. However, the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence to identify genetic diseases with facial phenotypes requires further investigation. The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence to identify the genetic diseases with face phenotypes and then find the best algorithm. The systematic review will be conducted in accordance with the &quot;Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols&quot; guidelines. The following electronic databases will be searched: PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE, Ovid, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. Two reviewers will screen and select the titles and abstracts of the studies retrieved independently during the database searches and perform full-text reviews and extract available data. The main outcome measures include diagnostic accuracy, as defined by accuracy, recall, specificity, and precision. The descriptive forest plot and summary receiver operating characteristic curves will be used to represent the performance of diagnostic tests. Subgroup analysis will be performed for different algorithms aided diagnosis tests. The quality of study characteristics and methodology will be assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool. Data will be synthesized by RevMan 5.3 and Meta-disc 1.4 software. The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis will be disseminated in a relevant peer-reviewed journal and academic presentations. To our knowledge, there have not been any systematic review or meta-analysis relating to diagnosis performance of artificial intelligence in identifying the genetic diseases with face phenotypes.

"Transport safety and human factors in the era of automation: What can transport modes learn from each other?","One of the main aims of introducing automation in transport is to improve safety by reducing or eliminating human errors; it is often argued however that this may induce new types of errors. There is different level of maturity with automation in different transport modes (road, aviation, maritime and rail), however no systematic research has been conducted on the lessons learned in different sectors, so that they can be exploited for the design of safer automated systems. The aim of this paper is to review the impact of key human factors on the safety of automated transport systems, with focus on relevant experiences from different transport sectors. A systematic literature review is carried out on the following topics: the level of trust in automation - in particular the impact of mis-aligned trust, i.e. mistrust vs overreliance, the resulting impact on operator situation awareness (SA), the implications for takeover control from machine to human, and the role of experience and training on using automated transport systems. The results revealed several areas where experiences from the aviation and road domain can be transferable to other sectors. Experiences from maritime and rail transport, although limited, tend to confirm the general patterns. Remarkably, in the road sector where higher levels of automation are only recently introduced, there are clearer and more quantitative approaches to human factors, while other sectors focus only on mental modes. Other sectors could use similar approaches to define their own context-specific metrics. The paper makes a synthesis of key messages on automation safety in different transport sectors, and presents an assessment of their transferability.","Papadimitriou, Schneider, Aguinaga Tello, Damen, Lomba Vrouenraets, Ten Broeke","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2020.105656","20200818","Aviation; Human factors; Maritime; Rail; Road; Safety; Transport automation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16547,""
"Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Arrhythmias and Cardiac Electrophysiology","Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in medicine are currently areas of intense exploration, showing potential to automate human tasks and even perform tasks beyond human capabilities. Literacy and understanding of AI/ML methods are becoming increasingly important to researchers and clinicians. The first objective of this review is to provide the novice reader with literacy of AI/ML methods and provide a foundation for how one might conduct an ML study. We provide a technical overview of some of the most commonly used terms, techniques, and challenges in AI/ML studies, with reference to recent studies in cardiac electrophysiology to illustrate key points. The second objective of this review is to use examples from recent literature to discuss how AI and ML are changing clinical practice and research in cardiac electrophysiology, with emphasis on disease detection and diagnosis, prediction of patient outcomes, and novel characterization of disease. The final objective is to highlight important considerations and challenges for appropriate validation, adoption, and deployment of AI technologies into clinical practice.","Feeny, Chung, Madabhushi, Attia, Cikes, Firouznia, Friedman, Kalscheur, Kapa, Narayan, Noseworthy, Passman, Perez, Peters, Piccini, Tarakji, Thomas, Trayanova, Turakhia, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCEP.119.007952","20201027","artificial intelligence; atrial fibrillation; cardiac electrophysiology; computers; diagnosis; machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16548,""
"A systematic review on spatial crime forecasting","Predictive policing and crime analytics with a spatiotemporal focus get increasing attention among a variety of scientific communities and are already being implemented as effective policing tools. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview and evaluation of the state of the art in spatial crime forecasting focusing on study design and technical aspects. We follow the PRISMA guidelines for reporting this systematic literature review and we analyse 32 papers from 2000 to 2018 that were selected from 786 papers that entered the screening phase and a total of 193 papers that went through the eligibility phase. The eligibility phase included several criteria that were grouped into: (a) the publication type, (b) relevance to research scope, and (c) study characteristics. The most predominant type of forecasting inference is the hotspots (i.e. binary classification) method. Traditional machine learning methods were mostly used, but also kernel density estimation based approaches, and less frequently point process and deep learning approaches. The top measures of evaluation performance are the Prediction Accuracy, followed by the Prediction Accuracy Index, and the F1-Score. Finally, the most common validation approach was the train-test split while other approaches include the cross-validation, the leave one out, and the rolling horizon. Current studies often lack a clear reporting of study experiments, feature engineering procedures, and are using inconsistent terminology to address similar problems. There is a remarkable growth in spatial crime forecasting studies as a result of interdisciplinary technical work done by scholars of various backgrounds. These studies address the societal need to understand and combat crime as well as the law enforcement interest in almost real-time prediction. Although we identified several opportunities and strengths there are also some weaknesses and threats for which we provide suggestions. Future studies should not neglect the juxtaposition of (existing) algorithms, of which the number is constantly increasing (we enlisted 66). To allow comparison and reproducibility of studies we outline the need for a protocol or standardization of spatial forecasting approaches and suggest the reporting of a study's key data items.","Kounadi, Ristea, Araujo, Leitner","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40163-020-00116-7","20200928","Crime; Forecasting; Hotspots; Prediction; Predictive policing; Spatial analysis; Spatiotemporal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16549,""
"Working with a new kind of team: harnessing the wisdom of the crowd in trial identification","At a time when research output is expanding exponentially, citizen science, the process of engaging willing volunteers in scientific research activities, has an important role to play in helping to manage the information overload. It also creates a model of contribution that enables anyone with an interest in health to contribute meaningfully and in a way that is flexible. Citizen science models have been shown to be extremely effective in other domains such as astronomy and ecology. Cochrane Crowd (crowd.cochrane.org) is a citizen science platform that offers contributors a range of microtasks, designed to help identify and describe health research. The platform enables contributors to dive into needed tasks that capture and describe health evidence. Brief interactive training modules and agreement algorithms help to ensure accurate collective decision making. Contributors can work online or offline; they can view their activity and performance in detail. They can choose to work in topic areas of interest to them such dementia or diabetes, and as contributors progress, they unlock milestone rewards and new tasks. Cochrane Crowd was launched in May 2016. It now hosts a range of microtasks which help to identify health evidence and then describe it according to a PICO (Population; Intervention; Comparator; Outcome) ontology. The microtasks are either at 'citation level' in which a contributor is presented with a title and abstract to classify or annotate, or at the full-text level in which a whole or a portion of a full paper is displayed. To date (March 2019), the Cochrane Crowd community comprises over 12,000 contributors from more than 180 countries. Almost 3Ã‚Â million individual classifications have been made, and around 70,000 reports of randomised trials have been identified for Cochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials. Performance evaluations to assess crowd accuracy have shown crowd sensitivity is 99.1%, and crowd specificity is 99%. Main motivations for involvement are that people want to help Cochrane, and people want to learn. This model of contribution is now an established part of Cochrane's effort to manage the deluge of information produced in a way that offers contributors a chance to get involved, learn and play a crucial role in evidence production. Our experience has shown that people want to be involved and that, with little or no prior experience, can do certain tasks to a very high degree of collective accuracy. Using a citizen science approach effectively has enabled Cochrane to better support its expert community through better use of human effort. It has also generated large, high-quality data sets on a scale not carried out before which has provided training material for machine learning routines. Citizen science is not an easy option, but performed well it brings a wealth of advantages to both the citizen and the organisation.","Noel-Storr","https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2019.e170715","20200928","citizen science; crowdsourcing; metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis; microtask; randomised controlled trial; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16550,""
"Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Applied at the Point of Care","The increasing availability of healthcare data and rapid development of big data analytic methods has opened new avenues for use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)- and Machine Learning (ML)-based technology in medical practice. However, applications at the point of care are still scarce. Review and discuss case studies to understand current capabilities for applying AI/ML in the healthcare setting, and regulatory requirements in the US, Europe and China. A targeted narrative literature review of AI/ML based digital tools was performed. Scientific publications (identified in PubMed) and grey literature (identified on the websites of regulatory agencies) were reviewed and analyzed. From the regulatory perspective, AI/ML-based solutions can be considered medical devices (i.e., Software as Medical Device, SaMD). A case series of SaMD is presented. First, tools for monitoring and remote management of chronic diseases are presented. Second, imaging applications for diagnostic support are discussed. Finally, clinical decision support tools to facilitate the choice of treatment and precision dosing are reviewed. While tested and validated algorithms for precision dosing exist, their implementation at the point of care is limited, and their regulatory and commercialization pathway is not clear. Regulatory requirements depend on the level of risk associated with the use of the device in medical practice, and can be classified into administrative (manufacturing and quality control), software-related (design, specification, hazard analysis, architecture, traceability, software risk analysis, cybersecurity, etc.), clinical evidence (including patient perspectives in some cases), non-clinical evidence (dosing validation and biocompatibility/toxicology) and other, such as e.g. benefit-to-risk determination, risk assessment and mitigation. There generally is an alignment between the US and Europe. China additionally requires that the clinical evidence is applicable to the Chinese population and recommends that a third-party central laboratory evaluates the clinical trial results. The number of promising AI/ML-based technologies is increasing, but few have been implemented widely at the point of care. The need for external validation, implementation logistics, and data exchange and privacy remain the main obstacles.","Angehrn, Haldna, Zandvliet, Gil Berglund, Zeeuw, Amzal, Cheung, Polasek, Pfister, Kerbusch, Heckman","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.00759","20200928","Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in medical practice; chronic disease management; clinical decision support tools; model-informed precision dosing; precision dosing; real-world evidence; software as a medical device","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16551,""

Several ECG parameters have already been proposed to have prognostic value with regard to both in-hospital and long-term follow-up of patients. In this review, we discuss various ECG parameters other than ST segment changes, particularly with regard to their in-hospital prognostic importance. Our review not only evaluates the prognostic segments and parts of ECG, but also highlights the need for an integrative approach in a bigÃ‚Â data to re-assess the parameters reported to predict in-hospital prognosis. The evolving importance of artificial intelligence in evaluation of ECG, particularly with regard to predicting prognosis, and the potential integration with other patient characteristics to predict prognosis, are discussed.","HayÃ„Â±roÃ„Å¸lu, Lakhani, Tse, Ãƒâ€¡Ã„Â±nar, Ãƒâ€¡inier, TekkeÃ…Å¸in","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2020.04.011","20200706","Electrocardiography; In-hospital mortality; P wave; QRS morphology; QT interval; T wave","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16552,""
"Social media based surveillance systems for healthcare using machine learning: A systematic review","Real-time surveillance in the field of health informatics has emerged as a growing domain of interest among worldwide researchers. Evolution in this field has helped in the introduction of various initiatives related to public health informatics. Surveillance systems in the area of health informatics utilizing social media information have been developed for early prediction of disease outbreaks and to monitor diseases. In the past few years, the availability of social media data, particularly Twitter data, enabled real-time syndromic surveillance that provides immediate analysis and instant feedback to those who are charged with follow-ups and investigation of potential outbreaks. In this paper, we review the recent work, trends, and machine learning(ML) text classification approaches used by surveillance systems seeking social media data in the healthcare domain. We also highlight the limitations and challenges followed by possible future directions that can be taken further in this domain. To study the landscape of research in health informatics performing surveillance of the various health-related data posted on social media or web-based platforms, we present a bibliometric analysis of the 1240 publications indexed in multiple scientific databases (IEEE, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, PubMed) from the year 2010-2018. The papers were further reviewed based on the various machine learning algorithms used for analyzing health-related text posted on social media platforms. Based on the corpus of 148 selected articles, the study finds the types of social media or web-based platforms used for surveillance in the healthcare domain, along with the health topic(s) studied by them. In the corpus of selected articles, we found 26 articles were using machine learning technique. These articles were studied to find commonly used ML techniques. The majority of studies (24%) focused on the surveillance of flu or influenza-like illness (ILI). Twitter (64%) is the most popular data source to perform surveillance research using social media text data, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (33%) being the most used ML algorithm for text classification. The inclusion of online data in surveillance systems has improved the disease prediction ability over traditional syndromic surveillance systems. However, social media based surveillance systems have many limitations and challenges, including noise, demographic bias, privacy issues, etc. Our paper mentions future directions, which can be useful for researchers working in the area. Researchers can use this paper as a library for social media based surveillance systems in the healthcare domain and can expand such systems by incorporating the future works discussed in our paper.","Gupta, Katarya","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103500","20200907","Health informatics; Machine learning; Outbreak detection; Social media; Surveillance systems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16553,""
"A comprehensive overview of promising biomarkers in stage II colorectal cancer","Colon cancer (CC) has the highest incidence rate among gastrointestinal cancers and ranks the third in mortality among all cancers, which contributes to the current CC burden and constitutes a major public health issue. While therapeutic strategies for stage I, III, and IV CC are standardized, those for stage II CC remain debatable. The choice of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II CC depends on stage (pT4) and grade (high) of the disease, the presence of venous, perinervous, and/or lymphatic emboli, or the need of suboptimal surgery (tumor with initial occlusion or perforation needing emergency surgeries, &lt;12 lymph nodes harvested). Several prognostic factors that have been validated in retrospective studies can potentially define a population of CC patients at low and high-risk for reccurence. The role of biomarkers is becoming increasingly important for the future personalized treatment options.

"How to do things with (thousands of) words: Computational approaches to discourse analysis in Alzheimer's disease","Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an ever-growing field of computational science that aims to model natural human language. Combined with advances in machine learning, which learns patterns in data, it offers practical capabilities including automated language analysis. These approaches have garnered interest from clinical researchers seeking to understand the breakdown of language due to pathological changes in the brain, offering fast, replicable and objective methods. The study of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and preclinical Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), suggests that changes in discourse (connected speech or writing) may be key to early detection of disease. There is currently no disease-modifying treatment for AD, the leading cause of dementia in people over the age of 65, but detection of those at risk of developing the disease could help with the identification and testing of medications which can take effect before the underlying pathology has irreversibly spread. We outline important components of natural language, as well as NLP tools and approaches with which they can be extracted, analysed and used for disease identification and risk prediction. We review literature using these tools to model discourse across the spectrum of AD, including the contribution of machine learning approaches and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We conclude that NLP and machine learning techniques are starting to greatly enhance research in the field, with measurable and quantifiable language components showing promise for early detection of disease, but there remain research and practical challenges for clinical implementation of these approaches. Challenges discussed include the availability of large and diverse datasets, ethics of data collection and sharing, diagnostic specificity and clinical acceptability.","Clarke, Foltz, Garrard","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2020.05.001","20200728","Alzheimer's disease; Discourse; Machine learning; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Natural Language Processing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16555,""
"Current applications of artificial intelligence for intraoperative decision support in surgery","Research into medical artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant advances in recent years, including surgical applications. This scoping review investigated AI-based decision support systems targeted at the intraoperative phase of surgery and found a wide range of technological approaches applied across several surgical specialties. Within the twenty-one (n = 21) included papers, three main categories of motivations were identified for developing such technologies: (1) augmenting the information available to surgeons, (2) accelerating intraoperative pathology, and (3) recommending surgical steps. While many of the proposals hold promise for improving patient outcomes, important methodological shortcomings were observed in most of the reviewed papers that made it difficult to assess the clinical significance of the reported performance statistics.

"Assessing quality of life in psychosocial and mental health disorders in children: a comprehensive overview and appraisal of generic health related quality of life measures","Mental health problems often arise in childhood and adolescence and can have detrimental effects on people's quality of life (QoL). Therefore, it is of great importance for clinicians, policymakers and researchers to adequately measure QoL in children. With this review, we aim to provide an overview of existing generic measures of QoL suitable for economic evaluations in children with mental health problems. First, we undertook a meta-review of QoL instruments in which we identified all relevant instruments. Next, we performed a systematic review of the psychometric properties of the identified instruments. Lastly, the results were summarized in a decision tree. This review provides an overview of these 22 generic instruments available to measure QoL in children with psychosocial and or mental health problems and their psychometric properties. A systematic search into the psychometric quality of these instruments found 195 suitable papers, of which 30 assessed psychometric quality in child and adolescent mental health. We found that none of the instruments was perfect for use in economic evaluation of child and adolescent mental health care as all instruments had disadvantages, ranging from lack of psychometric research, no proxy version, not being suitable for young children, no age-specific value set for children under 18, to insufficient focus on relevant domains (e.g. social and emotional domains).","Mierau, Kann-Weedage, Hoekstra, Spiegelaar, Jansen, Vermeulen, Reijneveld, van den Hoofdakker, Buskens, van den Akker-van Marle, Dirksen, Groenman","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-020-02220-8","20200708","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16558,""
"COVID-19 drug repurposing: Summary statistics on current clinical trials and promising untested candidates","Repurposing of existing anti-viral drugs, immunological modulators and supportive therapies represents a promising path towards rapidly developing new control strategies to mitigate the devastating public health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. A comprehensive text-mining and manual curation approach was used to comb and summarize the most pertinent information from existing clinical trials and previous efforts to develop therapies against related betacoronaviruses, particularly SARS and MERS. In contrast to drugs in current trials, which have been derived overwhelmingly from studies on taxonomically unrelated RNA viruses, a number of untested small molecule anti-virals had previously demonstrated remarkable in vitro specificity for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, with high selectivity indices, EC<sub>50</sub> and/or IC<sub>50</sub> . Due to the rapid containment of the prior epidemics, however, these were generally not followed up with in vivo animal studies or clinical investigations and thus largely overlooked as treatment prospects in the current COVID-19 trials.

"Understanding the relationship between patient language and outcomes in internet-enabled cognitive behavioural therapy: A deep learning approach to automatic coding of session transcripts","<b>Objective:</b> Understanding patient responses to psychotherapy is important in developing effective interventions. However, coding patient language is a resource-intensive exercise and difficult to perform at scale. Our aim was to develop a deep learning model to automatically identify patient utterances during text-based internet-enabled Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and to determine the association between utterances and clinical outcomes. <b>Method:</b> Using 340 manually annotated transcripts we trained a deep learning model to categorize patient utterances into one or more of five categories. The model was used to automatically code patient utterances from our entire data set of transcripts (Ã¢Ë†Â¼34,000 patients), and logistic regression analyses used to determine the association between both reliable improvement and engagement, and patient responses. <b>Results:</b> Our model reached human-level agreement on three of the five patient categories. Regression analyses revealed that increased counter change-talk (movement away from change) was associated with lower odds of both reliable improvement and engagement, while increased change-talk (movement towards change or self-exploration) was associated with increased odds of improvement and engagement. <b>Conclusions:</b> Deep learning provides an effective means of automatically coding patient utterances at scale. This approach enables the development of a data-driven understanding of the relationship between therapist and patient during therapy.","Ewbank, Cummins, Tablan, Catarino, Buchholz, Blackwell","https://doi.org/10.1080/10503307.2020.1788740","20200709","cognitive behaviour therapy; outcome research; technology in psychotherapy research &amp; training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16560,""
"Machine learning methods in organ transplantation","Machine learning techniques play an important role in organ transplantation. Analysing the main tasks for which they are being applied, together with the advantages and disadvantages of their use, can be of crucial interest for clinical practitioners. In the last 10 years, there has been an explosion of interest in the application of machine-learning techniques to organ transplantation. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature aiming to find universal models by considering multicenter cohorts or from different countries. Moreover, recently, deep learning has also been applied demonstrating a notable ability when dealing with a vast amount of information. Organ transplantation can benefit from machine learning in such a way to improve the current procedures for donor--recipient matching or to improve standard scores.

"Advances in accelerometry for cardiovascular patients: a systematic review with practical recommendations","Accelerometers are becoming increasingly commonplace for assessing physical activity; however, their use in patients with cardiovascular diseases is relatively substandard. We aimed to systematically review the methods used for collecting and processing accelerometer data in cardiology, using the example of heart failure, and to provide practical recommendations on how to improve objective physical activity assessment in patients with cardiovascular diseases by using accelerometers. Four electronic databases were searched up to September 2019 for observational, interventional, and validation studies using accelerometers to assess physical activity in patients with heart failure. Study and population characteristics, details of accelerometry data collection and processing, and description of physical activity metrics were extracted from the eligible studies and synthesized. To assess the quality and completeness of accelerometer reporting, the studies were scored using 12 items on data collection and processing, such as the placement of accelerometer, days of data collected, and criteria for non-wear of the accelerometer. In 60 eligible studies with 3500 patients (of those, 536 were heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients), a wide variety of accelerometer brands (n = 27) and models (n = 46) were used, with Actigraph being the most frequent (n = 12), followed by Fitbit (n = 5). The accelerometer was usually worn on the hip (n = 32), and the most prevalent wear period was 7 days (n = 22). The median wear time required for a valid day was 600 min, and between two and five valid days was required for a patient to be included in the analysis. The most common measures of physical activity were steps (n = 20), activity counts (n = 15), and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (n = 14). Only three studies validated accelerometers in a heart failure population, showing that their accuracy deteriorates at slower speeds. Studies failed to report between one and six (median 4) of the 12 scored items, with non-wear time criteria and valid day definition being the most underreported items. The use of accelerometers in cardiology lacks consistency and reporting on data collection, and processing methods need to be improved. Furthermore, calculating metrics based on raw acceleration and machine learning techniques is lacking, opening the opportunity for future exploration. Therefore, we encourage researchers and clinicians to improve the quality and transparency of data collection and processing by following our proposed practical recommendations for using accelerometers in patients with cardiovascular diseases, which are outlined in the article.","Vetrovsky, Clark, Bisi, Siranec, Linhart, Tufano, Duncan, Belohlavek","https://doi.org/10.1002/ehf2.12781","20201030","Counts; Cut points; Heart failure; Physical activity; Raw acceleration; Steps","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16562,""
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): an evidence map of medical literature","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019, a substantial body of COVID-19 medical literature has been generated. As of June 2020, gaps and longitudinal trends in the COVID-19 medical literature remain unidentified, despite potential benefits for research prioritisation and policy setting in both the COVID-19 pandemic and future large-scale public health crises. In this paper, we searched PubMed and Embase for medical literature on COVID-19 between 1 January and 24 March 2020. We characterised the growth of the early COVID-19 medical literature using evidence maps and bibliometric analyses to elicit cross-sectional and longitudinal trends and systematically identify gaps. The early COVID-19 medical literature originated primarily from Asia and focused mainly on clinical features and diagnosis of the disease. Many areas of potential research remain underexplored, such as mental health, the use of novel technologies and artificial intelligence, pathophysiology of COVID-19 within different body systems, and indirect effects of COVID-19 on the care of non-COVID-19 patients. Few articles involved research collaboration at the international level (24.7%). The median submission-to-publication duration was 8 days (interquartile range: 4-16). Although in its early phase, COVID-19 research has generated a large volume of publications. However, there are still knowledge gaps yet to be filled and areas for improvement for the global research community.

"Combined Orthodontic-Orthognathic Approach for Dentofacial Deformities as a Risk Factor for Gingival Recession: A Systematic Review","The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the risk of development of gingival recession (GR) as a result of the combined orthodontic-orthognathic approach. The PubMed, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Included articles mentioned gingival parameters in their materials and methods sections; specifically, they evaluated GR, which was measured before and after the surgical procedure. Study parameters such as methodology, evaluation period, sample characteristics, and follow-up were extracted by 2 authors independently. In total, 133 relevant articles were identified from the databases; after screening and full-text analysis, 9 studies were included in this systematic review. Meta-analysis could not be conducted because of considerable heterogeneity in methods. The incidence of GR in the range of 0.5 to 3.0Ã‚Â mm as a significant clinical finding after orthognathic surgery showed statistically significant differences in all included articles. Among patients with GR, the mean age was 23.0 to 29.5Ã‚Â years and the mandibular incisors were the most common site. However,Ã‚Â no case of recession greater than 3.0 mm was associated with surgery. On the basis of the findings of this review, GR of approximately 0.5 to 3.0Ã‚Â mm is a common finding after the combined orthodontic-orthognathic approach. Although periodontal damage up to 3Ã‚Â mm can be observed as an isolated finding in mainly the incisors, true recession is not associated with orthognathic surgery in general.","Mota de Paulo, Herbert de Oliveira Mendes, GonÃƒÂ§alves Filho, MarÃƒÂ§al","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2020.05.040","20201030","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16564,""
"A Survey of Network Embedding for Drug Analysis and Prediction","Traditional network-based computational methods have shown good results in drug analysis and prediction. However, these methods are time consuming and lack universality, and it is difficult to exploit the auxiliary information of nodes and edges. Network embedding provides a promising way for alleviating the above problems by transforming network into a low-dimensional space while preserving network structure and auxiliary information. This thus facilitates the application of machine learning algorithms for subsequent processing. Network embedding has been introduced into drug analysis and prediction in the last few years, and has shown superior performance over traditional methods. However, there is no systematic review of this issue. This article offers a comprehensive survey of the primary network embedding methods and their applications in drug analysis and prediction. The network embedding technologies applied in homogeneous network and heterogeneous network are investigated and compared, including matrix decomposition, random walk, and deep learning. Especially, the Graph neural network (GNN) methods in deep learning are highlighted. Further, the applications of network embedding in drug similarity estimation, drug-target interaction prediction, adverse drug reactions prediction, protein function and therapeutic peptides prediction are discussed. Several future potential research directions are also discussed.","Liu, Chen, Lan, Liang, Chen, Chen","https://doi.org/10.2174/1389203721666200702145701","20200914"," <Keyword MajorTopicYN=""Y"">Network embedding; adverse drug reactions prediction; drug discovery; drug similarity estimation; drug-target prediction; protein function and therapeutic peptides prediction.

"Global characteristics and trends of research on construction dust: based on bibliometric and visualized analysis","The booming construction industry has led to many environmental and occupational health and safety problems. Construction dust caused irreversible damage to the health of frontline workers and polluted the surrounding air environment, which has attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners. In this study, to systematically sort and analyze the distribution of construction dust (CD) research, its hot areas, and the evolution of its fronts, papers with &quot;construction dust&quot; as the subject term in the Web of Science Core Collection Database since 2010 are visually analyzed using CiteSpace. The characteristics of these papers, including the quantity trend, quality, author group, affiliated institution type, and journal type, are summarized, and keyword co-appearance and paper co-citation knowledge maps are produced. The results show that (1) China is the backbone of CD research, and the research results account for a considerable proportion of the total. (2) Respiratory dust and atmospheric aerosols, marble dust, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and other hot issues have always attracted international attention. And exposure assessment and spatial distribution were the main focuses in the study of CD. (3) The direction of CD research will explore in a more subtle and intelligent direction in the future, for example, monitoring and control equipment under the technical support of big data technology and machine learning and face recognition. By combining bibliometrics with a systematic review, we aim to analyze the research foci and future development direction deeply, providing scholars with a comprehensive view of the field.","Guo, Tian, Li, Zhang, Li","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09723-y","20200915","Bibliometrics; CiteSpace; Construction dust (CD); Knowledge mapping; Bibliometrics; China; Databases, Factual; Dust; Humans; Technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16566,""
"Artificial intelligence in gastric cancer: a systematic review","This study aims to systematically review the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in gastric cancer and to discuss the potential limitations and future directions of AI in gastric cancer. A systematic review was performed that follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Pubmed, EMBASE, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were used to search for gastric cancer publications with an emphasis on AI that were published up to June 2020. The terms &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; and &quot;gastric cancer&quot; were used to search for the publications. A total of 64 articles were included in this review. In gastric cancer, AI is mainly used for molecular bio-information analysis, endoscopic detection for Helicobacter pylori infection, chronic atrophic gastritis, early gastric cancer, invasion depth, and pathology recognition. AI may also be used to establish predictive models for evaluating lymph node metastasis, response to drug treatments, and prognosis. In addition, AI can be used for surgical training, skill assessment, and surgery guidance. In the foreseeable future, AI applications can play an important role in gastric cancer management in the era of precision medicine.","Jin, Ji, Kang, Li, Liu, Ma, Ma, Hu, Li, Tian","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00432-020-03304-9","20200804","Artificial intelligence; Cancer management; Diagnosis; Gastric cancer; Treatment; Artificial Intelligence; Computational Biology; Humans; Lymphatic Metastasis; Prognosis; Stomach Neoplasms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16567,""
"Clinical teams' experiences of crowding in public emergency centres in Cape Town, South Africa","Crowding is a significant challenge for emergency centres (ECs) globally. While South Africa is not alone in reckoning with high patient demand and insufficient resources to treat these patients; staff-to-patient ratios are generally lower than in the Global North. The study of crowding and its consequences for patient care is a key research priority for strengthening the quality and efficacy of emergency care in South Africa. The study set out to understand frontline staff's perspectives on crowding in Cape Town public ECs to learn how they cope in such high- pressure working conditions, determine what they see as the factors contributing to crowding, and obtain their recommendations for reform. This research is a qualitative study from interviews and observations at five ECs in Cape Town, conducted in June and July 2017. In total 43 staff were interviewed individually or in pairs. The interviews included physicians of varying levels of experience (25), and registered or enrolled nurses (18). Data were analysed with the qualitative text-analysis software NVivo. Both doctors and nurses saw crowding as a consequence of three factors: 1) limited bed space in the EC, 2) insufficient health professionals to care for admitted patients, and 3) the presence of boarders. Systemic or organizational factors as well as human resource scarcity were determined to be the key reasons for crowding. With its high patient acuity and volume and its limited human and material resources, South Africa is an important case study for understanding how emergency care providers manage working in crowded conditions. The solutions to crowding recommended by interviewees were to expand the EC workforce and to add discharge lounges and examination tables.","van de Ruit, Lahri, Wallis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.afjem.2019.12.004","20200928","Emergency care; Qualitative research; South Africa","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16568,""
"A systematic review of endovascular stent-electrode arrays, a minimally invasive approach to brain-machine interfaces","The goal of this study was to systematically review the feasibility and safety of minimally invasive neurovascular approaches to brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). A systematic literature review was performed using the PubMed database for studies published between 1986 and 2019. All studies assessing endovascular neural interfaces were included. Additional studies were selected based on review of references of selected articles and review articles. Of the 53 total articles identified in the original literature search, 12 studies were ultimately selected. An additional 10 articles were included from other sources, resulting in a total of 22 studies included in this systematic review. This includes primarily preclinical studies comparing endovascular electrode recordings with subdural and epidural electrodes, as well as studies evaluating stent-electrode gauge and material type. In addition, several clinical studies are also included. Endovascular stent-electrode arrays provide a minimally invasive approach to BMIs. Stent-electrode placement has been shown to be both efficacious and safe, although further data are necessary to draw comparisons between subdural and epidural electrode measurements given the heterogeneity of the studies included. Greater access to deep-seated brain regions is now more feasible with stent-electrode arrays; however, further validation is needed in large clinical trials to optimize this neural interface. This includes the determination of ideal electrode material type, venous versus arterial approaches, the feasibility of deep brain stimulation, and more streamlined computational decoding techniques.","Soldozy, Young, Kumar, Capek, Felbaum, Jean, Park, Syed","https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.4.FOCUS20186","20200826","BMI = brain-machine interface; DBS = deep brain stimulation; SNR = signal-to-noise ratio; SSS = superior sagittal sinus; SVM = support vector machine; brain-machine interface; endovascular stent-electrode; minimally invasive; neural interface","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16569,""
"An Ensemble Learning Strategy for Eligibility Criteria Text Classification for Clinical Trial Recruitment: Algorithm Development and Validation","Eligibility criteria are the main strategy for screening appropriate participants for clinical trials. Automatic analysis of clinical trial eligibility criteria by digital screening, leveraging natural language processing techniques, can improve recruitment efficiency and reduce the costs involved in promoting clinical research. We aimed to create a natural language processing model to automatically classify clinical trial eligibility criteria. We proposed a classifier for short text eligibility criteria based on ensemble learning, where a set of pretrained models was integrated. The pretrained models included state-of-the-art deep learning methods for training and classification, including Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), XLNet, and A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa). The classification results by the integrated models were combined as new features for training a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model for eligibility criteria classification. Our proposed method obtained an accuracy of 0.846, a precision of 0.803, and a recall of 0.817 on a standard data set from a shared task of an international conference. The macro F1 value was 0.807, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline methods on the shared task. We designed a model for screening short text classification criteria for clinical trials based on multimodel ensemble learning. Through experiments, we concluded that performance was improved significantly with a model ensemble compared to a single model. The introduction of focal loss could reduce the impact of class imbalance to achieve better performance.","Zeng, Pan, Xu, Qu","https://doi.org/10.2196/17832","20200928","Clinical trial; Deep learning; Eligibility criteria; Ensemble learning; Text classification","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16570,""
"[Analysis of Activity and Its Emissions Trend for Construction Equipment in China]","Emissions from non-road equipment are attracting more attention due to their increasing contribution to air pollution. Thus, an accurate estimate of emission inventory for non-road equipment is imperative for air quality management and improvement. Activity data from a large range of construction equipment were collected from multiple sources, including on-site/phone interviews and literature review, and used for further analysis to characterize its operations. Activity analysis of construction equipment included:Ã¢â€˜Â activity of construction equipment by type (functionality); Ã¢â€˜Â¡activity differences by geographical area; and Ã¢â€˜Â¢activity differences by age. A back-propagation neural network model was developed to estimate the construction equipment population in China from 2018 to 2025. Furthermore, real-world measurements of emissions were made on 47 selected examples of construction equipment using a portable emission measurement system. Population, activity, and emission factors were then combined to develop emission inventories for construction equipment in China from 2015 to 2025. The results showed that activity of construction equipment differs by type or functionality, ranging from 1439 to 4332 hours per year. Furthermore, there are differences in activity by as much as three times due to geographical area differences for the same construction equipment type. In general, activity of construction equipment decreases as it ages by a rate of approximately 140 to 150 hours per year. It is estimated that CO, HC, NO, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions of construction equipment in China in 2015 were approximately 2.099, 0.462, 3.452, and 0.574 million tons, respectively. Compared to 2015, due to the slow growth of the construction equipment population, CO, HC, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions will decrease by 2.4%-33.1% and 7.1%-64.7% by 2020 and 2025, respectively, depending on pollutant. It should be noted that NO emissions appear to increase slightly for the first several years in the future, but then decrease after 2020. As increasingly stringent regulations have been enforced for on-road vehicles, but less has been done regarding non-road equipment, although total emissions from non-road equipment continue to decrease, their contribution to air pollution will continue to increase; they should therefore be one of the focuses for future work.","Pang, Zhang, Ma, Wang","https://doi.org/10.13227/j.hjkx.201909174","20200706","activity analysis; construction equipment; emission inventory; population; tailpipe emissions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16571,""
"Shared and distinct functional networks for empathy and pain processing: a systematic review and meta-analysis of fMRI studies","Empathy for pain is a complex phenomenon incorporating sensory, cognitive and affective processes. Functional neuroimaging studies indicate a rich network of brain activations for empathic processing. However, previous research focused on core activations in bilateral anterior insula (AI) and anterior cingulate/anterior midcingulate cortex (ACC/aMCC) which are also typically present during nociceptive (pain) processing. Theoretical understanding of empathy would benefit from empirical investigation of shared and contrasting brain activations for empathic and nociceptive processing. Thirty-nine empathy for observed pain studies (1112 participants; 527 foci) were selected by systematic review. Coordinate based meta-analysis (activation likelihood estimation) was performed and novel contrast analyses compared neurobiological processing of empathy with a comprehensive meta-analysis of 180 studies of nociceptive processing (Tanasescu etÃ‚Â al., 2016). Conjunction analysis indicated overlapping activations for empathy and nociception in AI, aMCC, somatosensory and inferior frontal regions. Contrast analysis revealed increased likelihood of activation for empathy, relative to nociception, in bilateral supramarginal, inferior frontal and occipitotemporal regions. Nociception preferentially activated bilateral posterior insula, somatosensory cortex and aMCC. Our findings support the likelihood of shared and distinct neural networks for empathic, relative to nociceptive, processing. This offers succinct empirical support for recent tiered or modular theoretical accounts of empathy.","Fallon, Roberts, Stancak","https://doi.org/10.1093/scan/nsaa090","20201001","activation likelihood estimation; neuroimaging; perception action model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16572,""
"Uterine fibroids may play a protecting role against endometrial carcinoma in Chinese women with gynecological diseases","It has been reported that uterine fibroids (UFs) may increase the risk of endometrial carcinoma (EC) with the underlying mechanism largely unknown. Here, we explore whether UF could be an influential factor for EC. We have collected and analyzed clinical data from 4537 Chinese patients to study the co-incidence of UF and EC. Then, a large-scale literature-based data mining was conducted to identify genes implicated as UF downstream regulating targets and EC upstream regulators. In addition, a meta-analysis has been conducted for each of the EC-specific genes, using six independent UF expression datasets. The meta-analysis results, together with literature-based pathway analysis, were used to explore the potential explanation of the clinical data. Our results showed that the incidence rate of EC in the case of UF was 50.53% lower than without UF, which suggested a protective role of UF in EC patients. The meta-analysis identified three significantly overexpressed genes (HTRA3, HOPX, and PCNA) in the case of UF, which were implicated as EC inhibitors in the pathway analysis. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis showed that, compared with UF, aging might be a stronger influential factor for EC. Among women with gynecological diseases, UFs may play a protecting role against EC in the Chinese population.","Qiao, Xia, Dong, Cheng, Cao","https://doi.org/10.1042/BSR20200350","20200723","HOPX; HTRA3; PCNA; Uterine fibroids; endometrial carcinoma; mega-analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16573,""
"MR Image-Based Attenuation Correction of Brain PET Imaging: Review of Literature on Machine Learning Approaches for Segmentation","Recent emerging hybrid technology of positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging has generated a great need for an accurate MR image-based PET attenuation correction. MR image segmentation, as a robust and simple method for PET attenuation correction, has been clinically adopted in commercial PET/MR scanners. The general approach in this method is to segment the MR image into different tissue types, each assigned an attenuation constant as in an X-ray CT image. Machine learning techniques such as clustering, classification and deep networks are extensively used for brain MR image segmentation. However, only limited work has been reported on using deep learning in brain PET attenuation correction. In addition, there is a lack of clinical evaluation of machine learning methods in this application.

"A study of MRI-based radiomics biomarkers for sacroiliitis and spondyloarthritis","To evaluate the performance of texture-based biomarkers by radiomic analysis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients with sacroiliitis secondary to spondyloarthritis (SpA). The determination of sacroiliac joints inflammatory activity supports the drug management in these diseases. Sacroiliac joints (SIJ) MRI examinations of 47 patients were evaluated. Thirty-seven patients had SpA diagnoses (27 axial SpA and ten peripheral SpA) which was established previously after clinical and laboratory follow-up. To perform the analysis, the SIJ MRI was first segmented and warped. Second, radiomics biomarkers were extracted from the warped MRI images for associative analysis with sacroiliitis and the SpA subtypes. Finally, statistical and machine learning methods were applied to assess the associations of the radiomics texture-based biomarkers with clinical outcomes. All diagnostic performances obtained with individual or combined biomarkers reached areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.80 regarding SpA related sacroiliitis andÃ‚Â and SpA subtypes classification. Radiomics texture-based analysis showed significant differences between the positive and negative SpA groups and differentiated the axial and peripheral subtypes (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). In addition, the radiomics analysis was also able to correctly identify the disease even in the absence of active inflammation. We concluded that the application of the radiomic approach constitutes a potential noninvasive tool to aid the diagnosis of sacroiliitis and for SpA subclassifications based on MRI of sacroiliac joints.","TenÃƒÂ³rio, Faleiros, Junior, Dalto, Assad, Louzada-Junior, Yoshida, Nogueira-Barbosa, de Azevedo-Marques","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02219-7","20200921","Magnetic resonance imaging; Radiomic biomarkers; Sacroiliitis; Spondyloarthritis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16575,""

Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) models were trained with varying data sources to perform SQuAD 2.0 style why-question answering (why-QA) on clinical notes. The evaluation focused on: (1) comparing the merits from different training data and (2) error analysis. The best model achieved an accuracy of 0.707 (or 0.760 by partial match). Training toward customization for the clinical language helped increase 6% in accuracy. The error analysis suggested that the model did not really perform deep reasoning and that clinical why-QA might warrant more sophisticated solutions. The BERT model achieved moderate accuracy in clinical why-QA and should benefit from the rapidly evolving technology. Despite the identified limitations, it could serve as a competent proxy for question-driven clinical information extraction.","Wen, Elwazir, Moon, Fan","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamiaopen/ooz072","20200928","artificial intelligence; clinical decision-making; evaluation studies; natural language processing; question answering","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16576,""
"Rapid antigen detection and molecular tests for group A streptococcal infections for acute sore throat: systematic reviews and economic evaluation","Sore throat is a common condition caused by an infection of the airway. Most cases are of a viral nature; however, a number of these infections may be caused by the group A <i>Streptococcus</i> bacterium. Most viral and bacterial sore throat infections resolve spontaneously within a few weeks. Point-of-care testing in primary care has been recognised as an emerging technology for aiding targeted antibiotic prescribing for sore throat in cases that do not spontaneously resolve. Systematically review the evidence for 21 point-of-care tests for detecting group A <i>Streptococcus</i> bacteria and develop a de novo economic model to compare the cost-effectiveness of point-of-care tests alongside clinical scoring tools with the cost-effectiveness of clinical scoring tools alone for patients managed in primary care and hospital settings. Multiple electronic databases were searched from inception to March 2019. The following databases were searched in November and December 2018 and searches were updated in March 2019: MEDLINE [via OvidSP (Health First, Rockledge, FL, USA)], MEDLINE In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations (via OvidSP), MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print (via OvidSP), MEDLINE Daily Update (via OvidSP), EMBASE (via OvidSP), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [via Wiley Online Library (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, USA)], Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (via Wiley Online Library), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (via Centre for Reviews and Dissemination), Health Technology Assessment database (via the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination), Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings [via the Web of ScienceÃ¢â€žÂ¢ (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA)] and the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (via the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination). Eligible studies included those of people aged Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°5 years presenting with sore throat symptoms, studies comparing point-of-care testing with antibiotic-prescribing decisions, studies of test accuracy and studies of cost-effectiveness. Quality assessment of eligible studies was undertaken. Meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity was carried out for tests with sufficient data. A decision tree model estimated costs and quality-adjusted life-years from an NHS and Personal Social Services perspective. The searches identified 38 studies of clinical effectiveness and three studies of cost-effectiveness. Twenty-six full-text articles and abstracts reported on the test accuracy of point-of-care tests and/or clinical scores with biological culture as a reference standard. In the population of interest (patients with Centor/McIsaac scores of Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°3 points or FeverPAIN scores of Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°4 points), point estimates were 0.829 to 0.946 for sensitivity and 0.849 to 0.991 for specificity. There was considerable heterogeneity, even for studies using the same point-of-care test, suggesting that is unlikely that any single study will have accurately captured a test's true performance. There is some randomised controlled trial evidence to suggest that the use of rapid antigen detection tests may help to reduce antibiotic-prescribing rates. Sensitivity and specificity estimates for each test in each age group and care setting combination were obtained using meta-analyses where appropriate. Any apparent differences in test accuracy may not be attributable to the tests, and may have been caused by known differences in the studies, latent characteristics or chance. Fourteen of the 21 tests reviewed were included in the economic modelling, and these tests were not cost-effective within the current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's cost-effectiveness thresholds. Uncertainties in the cost-effectiveness estimates included model parameter inputs and assumptions that increase the cost of testing, and the penalty for antibiotic overprescriptions. No information was identified for the elderly population or pharmacy setting. It was not possible to identify which test is the most accurate owing to the paucity of evidence. The systematic review and the cost-effectiveness models identified uncertainties around the adoption of point-of-care tests in primary and secondary care settings. Although sensitivity and specificity estimates are promising, we have little information to establish the most accurate point-of-care test. Further research is needed to understand the test accuracy of point-of-care tests in the proposed NHS pathway and in comparable settings and patient groups. The protocol of the review is registered as PROSPERO CRD42018118653. This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in <i>Health Technology Assessment</i>; Vol. 24, No. 31. See the NIHR Journals Library website for further project information. Sore throat is a common condition caused by an infection of the airway. Most cases are viral; however, a small number may be caused by the group A <i>Streptococcus</i> bacterium. Most viral and bacterial sore throat infections resolve spontaneously within a few weeks; however, some may be more serious and require antibiotics. Currently, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance recommends the use of clinical scoring tools to identify patients for whom antibiotic treatment is appropriate. Ideally, a throat swab culture should be obtained to identify the organism causing the infection in cases in which diagnosis is uncertain. However, this takes time, causing potential delays in administering the correct treatment. Point-of-care tests can be administered at or near the site of the patient; therefore, they are much faster. Our review considered evidence for the test accuracy and cost-effectiveness of 21 point-of-care tests for detecting group A <i>Streptococcus</i> bacteria. We built an economic model, predicting costs and benefits for adults and children in a primary care or hospital setting. The findings will support the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to make recommendations about the use of these point-of-care tests for detecting group A <i>Streptococcus</i> bacteria in the NHS in England and Wales. The clinical effectiveness review found 38 relevant studies; of these, 26 reported on the accuracy of point-of-care tests. These studies found wide variation in the accuracy of the tests. The quality of the evidence was weak and there was little information on some of the 21 tests. As the studies were all so different, it was not possible to identify which test is the most accurate. The economic model found considerable uncertainty about how costs and benefits would change if point-of-care tests were introduced in different care settings. Further research is needed to see whether or not point-of-care testing provides value for money.","Fraser, Gallacher, Achana, Court, Taylor-Phillips, Nduka, Stinton, Willans, Gill, Mistry","https://doi.org/10.3310/hta24310","20200714","DIAGNOSTIC; ECONOMIC ANALYSIS; PHARYNGITIS; POINT-OF-CARE TESTS; SORE THROAT; SYSTEMATIC REVIEW; TEST ACCURACY","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16577,""

Our algorithm shows the accuracy of 0.96 and ROC AUC = 0.96 and might be easily implemented in other medical domains.","Danilov, Shifrin, Strunina, Kotik, Tsukanova, Pronkina, Ishankulov, Makashova, Kosyrkova, Melchenko, Zagidullin, Potapov","https://doi.org/10.3233/SHTI200492","20200714","Adverse Events; Annotation; Natural Language Processing; Neurosurgery; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Muscle Weakness; Natural Language Processing; Pharmacovigilance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16578,""
"Digital microbiology","Digitalization and artificial intelligence have an important impact on the way microbiology laboratories will work in the near future. Opportunities and challenges lie ahead to digitalize the microbiological workflows. Making efficient use of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in clinical microbiology requires a profound understanding of data handling aspects. This review article summarizes the most important concepts of digital microbiology. The article gives microbiologists, clinicians and data scientists a viewpoint and practical examples along the diagnostic process. We used peer-reviewed literature identified by a PubMed search for digitalization, machine learning, artificial intelligence and microbiology. We describe the opportunities and challenges of digitalization in microbiological diagnostic processes with various examples. We also provide in this context key aspects of data structure and interoperability, as well as legal aspects. Finally, we outline the way for applications in a modern microbiology laboratory. We predict that digitalization and the usage of machine learning will have a profound impact on the daily routine of laboratory staff. Along the analytical process, the most important steps should be identified, where digital technologies can be applied and provide a benefit. The education of all staff involved should be adapted to prepare for the advances in digital microbiology.","Egli, Schrenzel, Greub","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.06.023","20200925","Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Diagnostics; Digitalization; Image analysis; Interoperability; Microbiology; Post-analytics; Pre-analytics; Quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16579,""
"Artificial Intelligence Education and Tools for Medical and Health Informatics Students: Systematic Review","The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine will generate numerous application possibilities to improve patient care, provide real-time data analytics, and enable continuous patient monitoring. Clinicians and health informaticians should become familiar with machine learning and deep learning. Additionally, they should have a strong background in data analytics and data visualization to use, evaluate, and develop AI applications in clinical practice. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the current state of AI training and the use of AI tools to enhance the learning experience. A comprehensive systematic review was conducted to analyze the use of AI in medical and health informatics education, and to evaluate existing AI training practices. PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols) guidelines were followed. The studies that focused on the use of AI tools to enhance medical education and the studies that investigated teaching AI as a new competency were categorized separately to evaluate recent developments. This systematic review revealed that recent publications recommend the integration of AI training into medical and health informatics curricula. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review exploring the current state of AI education in both medicine and health informatics. Since AI curricula have not been standardized and competencies have not been determined, a framework for specialized AI training in medical and health informatics education is proposed.","Sapci, Sapci","https://doi.org/10.2196/19285","20200928","artificial intelligence; deep learning; education; health informatics; machine learning; medical education; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16580,""
"Machine learning and artificial intelligence in haematology","Digitalization of the medical record and integration of genomic methods into clinical practice have resulted in an unprecedented wealth of data. Machine learning is a subdomain of artificial intelligence that attempts to computationally extract meaningful insights from complex data structures. Applications of machine learning in haematological scenarios are steadily increasing. However, basic concepts are often unfamiliar to clinicians and investigators. The purpose of this review is to provide readers with tools to interpret and critically appraise machine learning literature. We begin with the elucidation of standard terminology and then review examples in haematology. Guidelines for designing and evaluating machine-learning studies are provided. Finally, we discuss limitations of the machine-learning approach.","Shouval, Fein, Savani, Mohty, Nagler","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.16915","20200630","artificial intelligence; haematology; leukaemia; machine learning; prediction models","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16581,""
"Quantitative ultrasound radiomics in predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer: Results from multi-institutional study","This study was conducted in order to develop a model for predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) using pretreatment quantitative ultrasound (QUS) radiomics. This was a multicenter study involving four sites across North America, and appropriate approval was obtained from the individual ethics committees. Eighty-two patients with LABC were included for final analysis. Primary tumors were scanned using a clinical ultrasound system before NAC was started. The tumors were contoured, and radiofrequency data were acquired and processed from whole tumor regions of interest. QUS spectral parameters were derived from the normalized power spectrum, and texture analysis was performed based on six QUS features using a gray level co-occurrence matrix. Patients were divided into responder or nonresponder classes based on their clinical-pathological response. Classification analysis was performed using machine learning algorithms, which were trained to optimize classification accuracy. Cross-validation was performed using a leave-one-out cross-validation method. Based on the clinical outcomes of NAC treatment, there were 48 responders and 34 nonresponders. A K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) approach resulted in the best classifier performance, with a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 83%, and an accuracy of 87%. QUS-based radiomics can predict response to NAC based on pretreatment features with acceptable accuracy.","DiCenzo, Quiaoit, Fatima, Bhardwaj, Sannachi, Gangeh, Sadeghi-Naini, Dasgupta, Kolios, Trudeau, Gandhi, Eisen, Wright, Look Hong, Sahgal, Stanisz, Brezden, Dinniwell, Tran, Yang, Curpen, Czarnota","https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.3255","20200821","imaging biomarker; locally advanced breast cancer; machine learning; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; quantitative ultrasound; radiomics; response prediction; texture analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16582,""
"Prognostic factors of biochemical remission after transsphenoidal surgery for acromegaly: a structured review","Biochemical control is the main determinant of survival, clinical manifestations and comorbidities in acromegaly. Transsphenoidal selective adenomectomy (TSA) is the initial treatment of choice with reported biochemical remission rates varying between 32 and 85%. Understanding the limiting factors is essential for identification of patients who require medical treatment. We reviewed the English literature published in Medline/Pubmed until Dec 31, 2019 to identify eligible studies that described outcomes of TSA as primary therapy and performed analyses to determine the main predictors of remission. Most publications reported single-institution, retrospective studies. The following preoperative parameters were consistently associated with lower remission rates: cavernous sinus invasion by imaging, larger tumor size and higher GH levels. Young age and preoperative IGF-1 levels were predictive in some studies. When controlled for covariates, the best single preoperative predictor was cavernous sinus invasion, followed by preoperative GH levels. Conversely, low GH level in the first few days postoperatively was a robust predictor of durable remission. The influence of tumor histology (sparsely granular pattern, co-expression of prolactin and proliferation markers) on surgical remission remains to be established. Few studies developed predictive models that yielded much higher predictive values than individual parameters. Surgical outcome prognostication systems could be further generated by machine learning algorithms in order to support development and implementation of personalized care in patients with acromegaly.","Agrawal, Ioachimescu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11102-020-01063-x","20200814","Acromegaly; Age; Cavernous sinus invasion; Gender; Growth hormone; Growth hormone secreting tumor; IGF-1; Remission; Sparsely granular tumors; Transsphenoidal surgery; Tumor markers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16583,""

"Theory and practical use of Bayesian methods in interpreting clinical trial data: a narrative review","The critical reading of scientific articles is necessary for the daily practice of evidence-based medicine. Rigorous comprehension of statistical methods is essential, as reflected by the extensive use of statistics in the biomedical literature. In contrast to the customary frequentist approach, which never uses or gives the probability of a hypothesis, Bayesian theory uses probabilities for both hypotheses and data. This statistical approach is increasingly used for analyses of clinical trial data and for applied machine learning. The aim of this review is to compare general Bayesian concepts with frequentist methods to facilitate a better understanding of Bayesian theory for readers who are not familiar with this approach. The review is intended to be used in combination with a checklist we have devised for reading reports analysed by Bayesian methods. We compare and contrast the different approaches of Bayesian vs frequentist statistical methods by considering data from a clinical trial that lends itself to this comparative approach.","Ferreira, Barthoulot, Pottecher, Torp, Diemunsch, Meyer","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.04.092","20200729","Bayesian methods; clinician; frequentist; randomised controlled trial; statistical analysis; theory; Bayes Theorem; Checklist; Consensus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16585,""
"Data for registry and quality review can be retrospectively collected using natural language processing from unstructured charts of arthroplasty patients","Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers an automated method to extract data from unstructured free text fields for arthroplasty registry participation. Our objective was to investigate how accurately NLP can be used to extract structured clinical data from unstructured clinical notes when compared with manual data extraction. A group of 1,000 randomly selected clinical and hospital notes from eight different surgeons were collected for patients undergoing primary arthroplasty between 2012 and 2018. In all, 19 preoperative, 17 operative, and two postoperative variables of interest were manually extracted from these notes. A NLP algorithm was created to automatically extract these variables from a training sample of these notes, and the algorithm was tested on a random test sample of notes. Performance of the NLP algorithm was measured in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) by calculating the accuracy of the variables collected, the ability of the algorithm to collect the correct information when it was indeed in the note (sensitivity), and the ability of the algorithm to not collect a certain data element when it was not in the note (specificity). The NLP algorithm performed well at extracting variables from unstructured data in our random test dataset (accuracy = 96.3%, sensitivity = 95.2%, and specificity = 97.4%). It performed better at extracting data that were in a structured, templated format such as range of movement (ROM) (accuracy = 98%) and implant brand (accuracy = 98%) than data that were entered with variation depending on the author of the note such as the presence of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) (accuracy = 90%). The NLP algorithm used in this study was able to identify a subset of variables from randomly selected unstructured notes in arthroplasty with an accuracy above 90%. For some variables, such as objective exam data, the accuracy was very high. Our findings suggest that automated algorithms using NLP can help orthopaedic practices retrospectively collect information for registries and quality improvement (QI) efforts.

"2020 Frank Stinchfield Award: Identifying who will fail following irrigation and debridement for prosthetic joint infection","Failure of irrigation and debridement (I&amp;D) for prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is influenced by numerous host, surgical, and pathogen-related factors. We aimed to develop and validate a practical, easy-to-use tool based on machine learning that may accurately predict outcome following I&amp;D surgery taking into account the influence of numerous factors. This was an international, multicentre retrospective study of 1,174 revision total hip (THA) and knee arthroplasties (TKA) undergoing I&amp;D for PJI between January 2005 and December 2017. PJI was defined using the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria. A total of 52 variables including demographics, comorbidities, and clinical and laboratory findings were evaluated using random forest machine learning analysis. The algorithm was then verified through cross-validation. Of the 1,174 patients that were included in the study, 405 patients (34.5%) failed treatment. Using random forest analysis, an algorithm that provides the probability for failure for each specific patient was created. By order of importance, the ten most important variables associated with failure of I&amp;D were serum CRP levels, positive blood cultures, indication for index arthroplasty other than osteoarthritis, not exchanging the modular components, use of immunosuppressive medication, late acute (haematogenous) infections, methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infection, overlying skin infection, polymicrobial infection, and older age. The algorithm had good discriminatory capability (area under the curve = 0.74). Cross-validation showed similar probabilities comparing predicted and observed failures indicating high accuracy of the model. This is the first study in the orthopaedic literature to use machine learning as a tool for predicting outcomes following I&amp;D surgery. The developed algorithm provides the medical profession with a tool that can be employed in clinical decision-making and improve patient care. Future studies should aid in further validating this tool on additional cohorts.

"A Clinically Applicable Approach to the Classification of B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas with Flow Cytometry and Machine Learning","The immunophenotype is a key element to classify B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (B-NHL); while it is routinely obtained through immunohistochemistry, the use of flow cytometry (FC) could bear several advantages. However, few FC laboratories can rely on a long-standing practical experience, and the literature in support is still limited; as a result, the use of FC is generally restricted to the analysis of lymphomas with bone marrow or peripheral blood involvement. In this work, we applied machine learning to our database of 1465 B-NHL samples from different sources, building four artificial predictive systems which could classify B-NHL in up to nine of the most common clinico-pathological entities. Our best model shows an overall accuracy of 92.68%, a mean sensitivity of 88.54% and a mean specificity of 98.77%. Beyond the clinical applicability, our models demonstrate (i) the strong discriminatory power of MIB1 and Bcl2, whose integration in the predictive model significantly increased the performance of the algorithm; (ii) the potential usefulness of some non-canonical markers in categorizing B-NHL; and (iii) that FC markers should not be described as strictly positive or negative according to fixed thresholds, but they rather correlate with different B-NHL depending on their level of expression.","Gaidano, Tenace, Santoro, Varvello, Cignetti, Prato, Saglio, De Rosa, Geuna","https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12061684","20200928","artificial intelligence; classification; flow cytometry; lymphoma; machine learning; non-hodgkin","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16588,""
"Performance of artificial intelligence in colonoscopy for adenoma and polyp detection: a systematic review and meta-analysis","One-fourth of colorectal neoplasia are missed at screening colonoscopy, representing the main cause of interval colorectal cancer. Deep learning systems with real-time computer-aided polyp detection (CADe) showed high accuracy in artificial settings, and preliminary randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported favorable outcomes in the clinical setting. The aim of this meta-analysis was to summarize available RCTs on the performance of CADe systems in colorectal neoplasia detection. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central databases until March 2020 for RCTs reporting diagnostic accuracy of CADe systems in the detection of colorectal neoplasia. The primary outcome was pooled adenoma detection rate (ADR), and secondary outcomes were adenoma per colonoscopy (APC) according to size, morphology, and location; advanced APC; polyp detection rate; polyps per colonoscopy; and sessile serrated lesions per colonoscopy. We calculated risk ratios (RRs), performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses, and assessed heterogeneity and publication bias. Overall, 5 randomized controlled trials (4354 patients) were included in the final analysis. Pooled ADR was significantly higher in the CADe group than in the control group (791/2163 [36.6%] vs 558/2191 [25.2%]; RR, 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1.62; PÃ‚Â &lt; .01; I<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â = 42%). APC was also higher in the CADe group compared with control (1249/2163 [.58] vs 779/2191 [.36]; RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.53-1.89; PÃ‚Â &lt; .01; I<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â = 33%). APC was higher forÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¤5-mm (RR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.48-1.84), 6- to 9-mm (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19-1.75), andÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¥10-mm adenomas (RR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.04-2.06) and for proximal (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.34-1.88), distal (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.50-1.88), flat (RR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.47-2.15), and polypoid morphology (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.40-1.68). Regarding histology, CADe resulted in a higher sessile serrated lesion per colonoscopy (RR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.14-2.02), whereas a nonsignificant trend for advanced ADR was found (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, .74-2.47; PÃ‚Â = .33; I<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â = 69%). Level of evidence for RCTs was graded as moderate. According to available evidence, the incorporation of artificial intelligence as aid for detection of colorectal neoplasia results in a significant increase in the detection of colorectal neoplasia, and such effect is independent from main adenoma characteristics.","Hassan, Spadaccini, Iannone, Maselli, Jovani, Chandrasekar, Antonelli, Yu, Areia, Dinis-Ribeiro, Bhandari, Sharma, Rex, RÃƒÂ¶sch, Wallace, Repici","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.06.059","20201019","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16589,""
"Quantifying the Uncertainty of Parameters Measured in Spontaneous Speech of Speakers With Dementia","Purpose Corpus analyses of spontaneous language fragments of varying length provide useful insights in the language change caused by brain damage, such as caused by some forms of dementia. Sample size is an important experimental parameter to consider when designing spontaneous language analyses studies. Sample length influences the confidence levels of analyses. Machine learning approaches often favor to use as much language as available, whereas language evaluation in a clinical setting is often based on truncated samples to minimize annotation labor and to limit any discomfort for participants. This article investigates, using Bayesian estimation of machine learned models, what the ideal text length should be to minimize model uncertainty. Method We use the Stanford parser to extract linguistic variables and train a statistic model to distinguish samples by speakers with no brain damage from samples by speakers with probable Alzheimer's disease. We compare the results to previously published models that used CLAN for linguistic analysis. Results The uncertainty around six individual variables and its relation to sample length are reported. The same model with linguistic variables that is used in all three experiments can predict group membership better than a model without them. One variable (concept density) is more informative when measured using the Stanford tools than when measured using CLAN. Conclusion For our corpus of German speech, the optimal sample length is found to be around 700 words long. Longer samples do not provide more information.","Ossewaarde, Jonkers, Jalvingh, Bastiaanse","https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_JSLHR-19-00222","20200722","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16590,""
"[Robot-assisted operations in vascular surgery]","The article contains a systematic review of the literature dedicated to vascular robot-assisted operations, also discussing the use of robotic technologies in vascular surgery, their advantages and disadvantages. In so doing, we studied the experience of Russian and leading international surgical centres, comparing the reported outcomes by such parameters as the average duration of the operation, mean time of aortic cross-clamping, time spent for anastomosis formation, frequency of postoperative complications, etc. Benefits of robot-assisted operations allowed the latter to occupy the leading positions in various fields of surgery, although the use of robots in vascular surgery has only begun to gain popularity.

"Toward the Development of Data Governance Standards for Using Clinical Free-Text Data in Health Research: Position Paper","Clinical free-text data (eg, outpatient letters or nursing notes) represent a vast, untapped source of rich information that, if more accessible for research, would clarify and supplement information coded in structured data fields. Data usually need to be deidentified or anonymized before they can be reused for research, but there is a lack of established guidelines to govern effective deidentification and use of free-text information and avoid damaging data utility as a by-product. This study aimed to develop recommendations for the creation of data governance standards to integrate with existing frameworks for personal data use, to enable free-text data to be used safely for research for patient and public benefit. We outlined data protection legislation and regulations relating to the United Kingdom for context and conducted a rapid literature review and UK-based case studies to explore data governance models used in working with free-text data. We also engaged with stakeholders, including text-mining researchers and the general public, to explore perceived barriers and solutions in working with clinical free-text. We proposed a set of recommendations, including the need for authoritative guidance on data governance for the reuse of free-text data, to ensure public transparency in data flows and uses, to treat deidentified free-text data as potentially identifiable with use limited to accredited data safe havens, and to commit to a culture of continuous improvement to understand the relationships between the efficacy of deidentification and reidentification risks, so this can be communicated to all stakeholders. By drawing together the findings of a combination of activities, we present a position paper to contribute to the development of data governance standards for the reuse of clinical free-text data for secondary purposes. While working in accordance with existing data governance frameworks, there is a need for further work to take forward the recommendations we have proposed, with commitment and investment, to assure and expand the safe reuse of clinical free-text data for public benefit.","Jones, Ford, Lea, Griffiths, Hassan, Heys, Squires, Nenadic","https://doi.org/10.2196/16760","20201020","ethical; free-text data; information governance; legal; public engagement; social implications","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16592,""
"Converging Multidimensional Sensor and Machine Learning Toward High-Throughput and Biorecognition Element-Free Multidetermination of Extracellular Vesicle Biomarkers","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a frontier class of circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of different diseases. These lipid structures afford various biomarkers such as the concentrations of the EVs (<i>C</i><sub>V</sub>) themselves and carried proteins (<i>C</i><sub>P</sub>). However, simple, high-throughput, and accurate determination of these targets remains a key challenge. Herein, we address the simultaneous monitoring of <i>C</i><sub>V</sub> and <i>C</i><sub>P</sub> from a single impedance spectrum without using recognizing elements by combining a multidimensional sensor and machine learning models. This multidetermination is essential for diagnostic accuracy because of the heterogeneous composition of EVs and their molecular cargoes both within the tumor itself and among patients. Pencil HB cores acting as electric double-layer capacitors were integrated into a scalable microfluidic device, whereas supervised models provided accurate predictions, even from a small number of training samples. User-friendly measurements were performed with sample-to-answer data processing on a smartphone. This new platform further showed the highest throughput when compared with the techniques described in the literature to quantify EVs biomarkers. Our results shed light on a method with the ability to determine multiple EVs biomarkers in a simple and fast way, providing a promising platform to translate biofluid-based diagnostics into clinical workflows.","Nicoliche, de Oliveira, da Silva, Ferreira, Rodrigues, Faria, Fazzio, Carrilho, de Pontes, Schleder, Lima","https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.0c00599","20200724","accuracy; cancer; exosome; point-of-care diagnosis; smartphone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16593,""
"[Machine learning-based method for interpreting the guidelines of the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19]","The outbreak of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (COVID-19) at the end of 2019 was a major public health emergency in human history. In a short period of time, Chinese medical workers have experienced the gradual understanding, evidence accumulation and clinical practice of the unknown virus. So far, National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China has issued seven trial versions of the &quot;Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19&quot;. However, it is difficult for clinicians and laymen to quickly and accurately distinguish the similarities and differences among the different versions and locate the key points of the new version. This paper reports a computer-aided intelligent analysis method based on machine learning, which can automatically analyze the similarities and differences of different treatment plans, present the focus of the new version to doctors, reduce the difficulty in interpreting the &quot;diagnosis and treatment plan&quot; for the professional, and help the general public better understand the professional knowledge of medicine. Experimental results show that this method can achieve the topic prediction and matching of the new version of the program text through unsupervised learning of the previous versions of the program topic with an accuracy of 100%. It enables the computer interpretation of &quot;diagnosis and treatment plan&quot; automatically and intelligently. 2019 Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã¥Âºâ€¢Ã¦Å¡Â´Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¯Â¼Ë†COVID-19Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ§Â±Â»Ã¥ÂÂ²Ã¤Â¸Å Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¦Â¬Â¡Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¥Â¤Â§Ã§ÂªÂÃ¥Ââ€˜Ã¥â€¦Â¬Ã¥â€¦Â±Ã¥ÂÂ«Ã§â€Å¸Ã¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¤Â¸Â­Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§Å¸Â­Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥â€ â€¦Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Â¯Â¥Ã¦Å“ÂªÃ§Å¸Â¥Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©â‚¬ÂÃ¦Â­Â¥Ã¨Â®Â¤Ã¨Â¯â€ Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨Â¯ÂÃ¦ÂÂ®Ã§Â§Â¯Ã§Â´Â¯Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¸Â´Ã¥ÂºÅ Ã¥Â®Å¾Ã¨Â·ÂµÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Ë†ÂªÃ¨â€¡Â³Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂÂ«Ã§â€Å¸Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â§â€Ã¥â€˜ËœÃ¤Â¼Å¡Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Â¤Â©Ã¥â€ â€¦Ã¥Â¯â€ Ã©â€ºâ€ Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¥Â¸Æ’Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸Æ’Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ§â€°Ë†Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Å¡â€žÃ£â‚¬Å Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¦Å¸â€œÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¨Â¯Å Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â¡Ë†Ã£â‚¬â€¹Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã§Â®â‚¬Ã§Â§Â°Ã£â‚¬Å Ã¨Â¯Å Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â¡Ë†Ã£â‚¬â€¹Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§â€žÂ¶Ã¨â‚¬Å’Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¿Â«Ã©â‚¬Å¸Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã§Â¡Â®Ã¥Å“Â°Ã¦Â¯â€Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¥Ââ€žÃ§â€°Ë†Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¼â€šÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Å½Å’Ã¦ÂÂ¡Ã¦â€“Â°Ã§â€°Ë†Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©â€¡ÂÃ§â€šÂ¹Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤Â¸Â´Ã¥ÂºÅ Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥â€™Å’Ã©ÂÅ¾Ã¤Â¸â€œÃ¤Â¸Å¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¦ÂÂ¥Ã¨Â¯Â´Ã¥Â­ËœÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¥â€ºÂ°Ã©Å¡Â¾Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å“Â¬Ã¦â€“â€¡Ã¦ÂÂÃ¥â€¡ÂºÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§Â§ÂÃ¥Å¸ÂºÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¥â„¢Â¨Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¤Â¹Â Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â®Â¡Ã§Â®â€”Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¨Â¾â€¦Ã¥Å Â©Ã¦â„¢ÂºÃ¨Æ’Â½Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¦â€“â€¡Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¤Â¸Â»Ã©Â¢ËœÃ¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¦â€”Â Ã§â€ºâ€˜Ã§ÂÂ£Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¤Â¹Â Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¥Å Â¨Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã§â€°Ë†Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã£â‚¬Å Ã¨Â¯Å Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â¡Ë†Ã£â‚¬â€¹Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¼â€šÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸Â»Ã¥Å Â¨Ã§Â»â„¢Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¦Å½Â¨Ã©â‚¬ÂÃ¦â€“Â°Ã§â€°Ë†Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã¦Â³Â¨Ã©â€¡ÂÃ§â€šÂ¹Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã©â„¢ÂÃ¤Â½Å½Ã£â‚¬Å Ã¨Â¯Å Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â¡Ë†Ã£â‚¬â€¹Ã¨Â§Â£Ã¨Â¯Â»Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸â€œÃ¤Â¸Å¡Ã©Å¡Â¾Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦ÂÂÃ©Â«ËœÃ©ÂÅ¾Ã¤Â¸â€œÃ¤Â¸Å¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â¯Â¹Ã¨Â¯Å Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â¡Ë†Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â®Â¤Ã¨Â¯â€ Ã¦Â°Â´Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â®Å¾Ã©ÂªÅ’Ã¨Â¯ÂÃ¦ËœÅ½Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥Â·Â¥Ã¨Â§Â£Ã¨Â¯Â»Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¥Â¼ÂÃ§â€ºÂ¸Ã¦Â¯â€Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¦â€“â€¡Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¥Å Â¨Ã¨Â®Â¡Ã§Â®â€”Ã¦â€“â€¡Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¤Â¸Â»Ã©Â¢ËœÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â®Å¾Ã§Å½Â°Ã¤Â¸Â»Ã©Â¢ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§Â²Â¾Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã¥Å’Â¹Ã©â€¦ÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥â€¡â€ Ã§Â¡Â®Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¨Â¾Â¾ 100%Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨â€¡ÂªÃ¥Å Â¨Ã§â€Å¸Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã©â€Â®Ã¨Â¯ÂÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¨Â¯Â­Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã§ÂºÂ§Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â§Â£Ã¨Â¯Â»Ã¦Å Â¥Ã¥â€˜Å Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â®Å¾Ã§Å½Â°Ã£â‚¬Å Ã¨Â¯Å Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â¡Ë†Ã£â‚¬â€¹Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â®Â¡Ã§Â®â€”Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¨â€¡ÂªÃ¥Å Â¨Ã¦â„¢ÂºÃ¨Æ’Â½Ã¨Â§Â£Ã¨Â¯Â»Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Pu, Chen, Liu, Wen, Zhneng, Li","https://doi.org/10.7507/1001-5515.202003045","20200701","COVID-19; artificial intelligence; biomedical engineering; diagnosis and treatment plan; machine learning; novel coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Machine Learning; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16594,""
"HDAC1-mediated deacetylation of LSD1 regulates vascular calcification by promoting autophagy in chronic renal failure","Chronic renal failure (CRF) is commonly associated with various adverse consequences including pathological vascular calcification (VC), which represents a significant clinical concern. Existing literature has suggested the involvement of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in the progression of CRF-induced VC. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with HDACs remain largely unknown. Therefore, we established the adenine-induced CRF rat model and in vitro VC models based on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to examine HDAC1/lysine demethylase 1A (LSD1)/SESN2 as a novel molecular pathway in CRF-induced VC. Our initial results demonstrated that HDAC1 reduced the formation of VC in vivo and in vitro. HDAC1 was found to deacetylate LSD1, which subsequently led to impaired transcriptional activity in CRF-induced VC. Moreover, our results illustrated that LSD1 diminished the enrichment of H3K4me2 at the SESN2 promoter. Autophagy was identified as a vasculo-protective element against calcification in VC. Finally, we found that the inhibitory effects of HDAC1 overexpression on VC were partially abolished via over-expressed LSD1 in adenine-induced CRF model rats and in high phosphate-induced VSMCs. Taken together, these results highlight the crucial role of HDAC1 as an antagonistic factor in the progression of VC in CRF, and also revealed a novel regulatory mechanism by which HDAC1 operates. These findings provide significant insight and a fresh perspective into promising novel treatment strategies by up-regulating HDAC1 in CRF.","Zhou, Zhou, Liu, Huang, Lu, Gao","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.15494","20200811","HDAC1; LSD1; SESN2; autophagy; chronic renal failure; deacetylation; vascular calcification","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16595,""
"Using Artificial Intelligence Resources in Dialysis and Kidney Transplant Patients: A Literature Review","The purpose of this review is to depict current research and impact of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms on dialysis and kidney transplantation. Published studies were presented from two points of view: What medical aspects were covered? What AI/ML algorithms have been used? We searched four electronic databases or studies that used AI/ML in hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and kidney transplantation (KT). Sixty-nine studies were split into three categories: AI/ML and HD, PD, and KT, respectively. We identified 43 trials in the first group, 8 in the second, and 18 in the third. Then, studies were classified according to the type of algorithm. AI and HD trials covered: (a) dialysis service management, (b) dialysis procedure, (c) anemia management, (d) hormonal/dietary issues, and (e) arteriovenous fistula assessment. PD studies were divided into (a) peritoneal technique issues, (b) infections, and (c) cardiovascular event prediction. AI in transplantation studies were allocated into (a) management systems (ML used as pretransplant organ-matching tools), (b) predicting graft rejection, (c) tacrolimus therapy modulation, and (d) dietary issues. Although guidelines are reluctant to recommend AI implementation in daily practice, there is plenty of evidence that AI/ML algorithms can predict better than nephrologists: volumes, Kt/V, and hypotension or cardiovascular events during dialysis. Altogether, these trials report a robust impact of AI/ML on quality of life and survival in G5D/T patients. In the coming years, one would probably witness the emergence of AI/ML devices that facilitate the management of dialysis patients, thus increasing the quality of life and survival.","Burlacu, Iftene, Jugrin, Popa, Lupu, Vlad, Covic","https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/9867872","20200630","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16596,""
"Review of Machine Learning in Predicting Dermatological Outcomes","Artificial intelligence is a broad branch of computer science that has garnered significant interest in the field of medicine because of its problem solving, decision making and pattern recognition abilities. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, hones in on the ability of computers to receive data and learn for themselves, manipulating algorithms as they organize the information they are processing. Dermatology is at a particular advantage in the implementation of machine learning due to the availability of large clinical image databases that can be used for machine training and interpretation. While numerous studies have implemented machine learning in the diagnostic aspect of dermatology, less research has been conducted on the use of machine learning in predicting long-term outcomes in skin disease, with only a few studies published to date. Such an approach would assist physicians in selecting the best treatment methods, save patients' time, reduce treatment costs and improve the quality of treatment overall by reducing the amount of trial-and-error in the treatment process. In this review, we aim to provide a brief and relevant introduction to basic artificial intelligence processes, and to consolidate and examine the published literature on the use of machine learning in predicting clinical outcomes in dermatology.","Du, Emam, Gniadecki","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00266","20200928","artificial intelligence; clinical outcomes; dermatology; machine learning; prediction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16597,""
"The Use of Artificial Intelligence in Screening and Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Literature Review","The detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is based on behavioral observations. To build a more objective datadriven method for screening and diagnosing ASD, many studies have attempted to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Therefore, the purpose of this literature review is to summarize the studies that used AI in the assessment process and examine whether other behavioral data could potentially be used to distinguish ASD characteristics. Based on our search and exclusion criteria, we reviewed 13 studies. To improve the accuracy of outcomes, AI algorithms have been used to identify items in assessment instruments that are most predictive of ASD. Creating a smaller subset and therefore reducing the lengthy evaluation process, studies have tested the efficiency of identifying individuals with ASD from those without. Other studies have examined the feasibility of using other behavioral observational features as potential supportive data. While previous studies have shown high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in classifying ASD and non-ASD individuals, there remain many challenges regarding feasibility in the real-world that need to be resolved before AI methods can be fully integrated into the healthcare system as clinical decision support systems.","Song, Kim, Bong, Kim, Yoo","https://doi.org/10.5765/jkacap.190027","20200928","Artificial intelligence; Autism spectrum disorder; Diagnosis; Screening","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16598,""
"Image-Guided Radiooncology: The Potential of Radiomics in Clinical Application","Medical imaging plays an imminent role in today's radiation oncology workflow. Predominantly based on semantic image analysis, malignant tumors are diagnosed, staged, and therapy decisions are made. The field of &quot;radiomics&quot; promises to extract complementary, objective information from medical images. In radiomics, predefined quantitative features including intensity statistics, texture, shape, or filtering techniques are combined into statistical or machine learning models to predict clinical or biological outcomes. Alternatively, deep neural networks can directly analyze medical images and provide predictions. A large number of research studies could demonstrate that radiomics prediction models may provide significant benefits in the radiation oncology workflow including diagnostics, tumor characterization, target volume segmentation, prognostic stratification, and prediction of therapy response or treatment-related toxicities. This chapter provides an overview of techniques within the radiomics toolbox, potential clinical application, and current limitations. A literature overview of four selected malignant entities including non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, soft tissue sarcomas, and gliomas is given.","Peeken, Wiestler, Combs","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-42618-7_24","20200928","Humans; Neoplasms; Prognosis; Radiation Oncology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16599,""
"Artificial neural networks for prediction of recurrent venous thromboembolism","Recurrent venous thromboembolism (RVTE) is a multifactorial disease with occurrence rates which vary from 13 % to 25 % in 5 years after the initial event. Once a patient the first thrombotic event, the probability of recurrence should be determined, as well as the most adequate anticoagulant therapy. To our knowledge based on the published literature, three statistical models have been proposed to calculate RVTE probability. However, these models present several limitations, such as: limited input variables, lack of external validation and applicability only for patients with a first unprovoked thrombosis. Additionally, some of the models have been recognized to fail in determining RVTE when patients have a low risk of recurrence. An alternative procedure in which three Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were developed to classify which patients will present RVTE based solely on clinical data. Data of 39 clinical factors from 235 patients were used to train several ANN structures. The difference among the three models was its inputs. In ANN 1, the inputs were all 39 factors. In ANN 2, 18 factors determined previously as the main predictors of RTVE using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Finally, in ANN 3, 15 factors combining PCA results with practical aspects. Different number of hidden layers and neurons, and three optimization algorithms were considered. 5-fold cross validation was also performed. The results showed that all models were capable of performing this task. Different optimization algorithms lead to different results. The best models presented high accuracy. The best structures were 39-10-10-1, 18-10-5-1, and 15-15-10-1 for ANN 1, ANN 2, and ANN 3 models, respectively. The cross-validation showed that the results are consistent. This work showed that the association of multivariate techniques and ANNs is a powerful tool that can be used to model a complex phenomenon such as RVTE without the restrictions of existing approaches. After proper validation, these ANN models can be used to help clinicians with decisions regarding VTE treatment.","Martins, Annichino-Bizzacchi, Romano, Maciel Filho","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104221","20201026","Artificial intelligence; Embolism and thrombosis; Prediction; Recurrence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16600,""
"Towards unstructured mortality prediction with free-text clinical notes","Healthcare data continues to flourish yet a relatively small portion, mostly structured, is being utilized effectively for predicting clinical outcomes. The rich subjective information available in unstructured clinical notes can possibly facilitate higher discrimination but tends to be under-utilized in mortality prediction. This work attempts to assess the gain in performance when multiple notes that have been minimally preprocessed are used as an input for prediction. A hierarchical architecture consisting of both convolutional and recurrent layers is used to concurrently model the different notes compiled in an individual hospital stay. This approach is evaluated on predicting in-hospital mortality on the MIMIC-III dataset. On comparison to approaches utilizing structured data, it achieved higher metrics despite requiring less cleaning and preprocessing. This demonstrates the potential of unstructured data in enhancing mortality prediction and signifies the need to incorporate more raw unstructured data into current clinical prediction methods.","Hashir, Sawhney","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103489","20200824","Clinical notes; Deep learning; Hierarchical neural networks; Mortality prediction; Text classification; Unstructured data","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16601,""
"Machine learning for genetic prediction of psychiatric disorders: a systematic review","Machine learning methods have been employed to make predictions in psychiatry from genotypes, with the potential to bring improved prediction of outcomes in psychiatric genetics; however, their current performance is unclear. We aim to systematically review machine learning methods for predicting psychiatric disorders from genetics alone and evaluate their discrimination, bias and implementation. Medline, PsycInfo, Web of Science and Scopus were searched for terms relating to genetics, psychiatric disorders and machine learning, including neural networks, random forests, support vector machines and boosting, on 10 September 2019. Following PRISMA guidelines, articles were screened for inclusion independently by two authors, extracted, and assessed for risk of bias. Overall, 63 full texts were assessed from a pool of 652 abstracts. Data were extracted for 77 models of schizophrenia, bipolar, autism or anorexia across 13 studies. Performance of machine learning methods was highly varied (0.48-0.95 AUC) and differed between schizophrenia (0.54-0.95 AUC), bipolar (0.48-0.65 AUC), autism (0.52-0.81 AUC) and anorexia (0.62-0.69 AUC). This is likely due to the high risk of bias identified in the study designs and analysis for reported results. Choices for predictor selection, hyperparameter search and validation methodology, and viewing of the test set during training were common causes of high risk of bias in analysis. Key steps in model development and validation were frequently not performed or unreported. Comparison of discrimination across studies was constrained by heterogeneity of predictors, outcome and measurement, in addition to sample overlap within and across studies. Given widespread high risk of bias and the small number of studies identified, it is important to ensure established analysis methods are adopted. We emphasise best practices in methodology and reporting for improving future studies.","Bracher-Smith, Crawford, Escott-Price","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-0825-2","20200917","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16602,""
"Building a PubMed knowledge graph","PubMed<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> is an essential resource for the medical domain, but useful concepts are either difficult to extract or are ambiguous, which has significantly hindered knowledge discovery.

"Diagnostic accuracy of deep learning in orthopaedic fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis","To gather and compare related clinical studies, and to investigate the accuracy and reliability of deep learning in detecting orthopaedic fractures. This study is a retrospective combination and interpretation of prospectively acquired data. Articles from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library databases, and reference lists of the qualified articles were retrieved. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using a random effective model. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were obtained by a random model. This work was managed from October 2018 to March 2020. Fourteen studies were included in this systematic review and nine were synthesized in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for the whole group (17 trials, 5,434 images) were 0.87 and 0.91, respectively. The AUC was 0.95. Eight trials (1,574 images) were included in the long-bone group, which contained seven studies. The pooled sensitivity was 0.96 and specificity was 0.94. The AUC was 0.99. Heterogeneity existed in the four pooled results of the whole group and the pooled specificity of the long-bone group. Deep learning is reliable in fracture diagnosis and has high diagnostic accuracy, which is similar to that of general physicians and is unlikely to produce a large number of false diagnoses; however, the ability of deep learning to localize the fracture needs more attention and testing. Deep learning can be extremely helpful with pre-classification of clinical diagnoses.","Yang, Yin, Cao, Feng, Fan, He","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2020.05.021","20200810","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16604,""
"External Validation of an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Prediction Model Using Radiology Reports","Acute respiratory distress syndrome is frequently under recognized and associated with increased mortality. Previously, we developed a model that used machine learning and natural language processing of text from radiology reports to identify acute respiratory distress syndrome. The model showed improved performance in diagnosing acute respiratory distress syndrome when compared to a rule-based method. In this study, our objective was to externally validate the natural language processing model in patients from an independent hospital setting. Secondary analysis of data across five prospective clinical studies. An urban, tertiary care, academic hospital. Adult patients admitted to the medical ICU and at-risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome. None. The natural language processing model was previously derived and internally validated in burn, trauma, and medical patients at Loyola University Medical Center. Two machine learning models were examined with the following text features from qualifying radiology reports: 1) word representations (n-grams) and 2) standardized clinical named entity mentions mapped from the National Library of Medicine Unified Medical Language System. The models were externally validated in a cohort of 235 patients at the University of Chicago Medicine, among which 110 (47%) were diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome by expert annotation. During external validation, the n-gram model demonstrated good discrimination between acute respiratory distress syndrome and nonacute respiratory distress syndrome patients (C-statistic, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.72-0.84). The n-gram model had a higher discrimination for acute respiratory distress syndrome when compared with the standardized named entity model, although not statistically significant (C-statistic 0.78 vs 0.72; p = 0.09). The most important features in the model had good face validity for acute respiratory distress syndrome characteristics but differences in frequencies did occur between hospital settings. Our computable phenotype for acute respiratory distress syndrome had good discrimination in external validation and may be used by other health systems for case-identification. Discrepancies in feature representation are likely due to differences in characteristics of the patient cohorts.","Mayampurath, Churpek, Su, Shah, Munroe, Patel, Dligach, Afshar","https://doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0000000000004468","20200824","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16605,""
"Clinical questionnaire filling based on question answering framework","Electronic Health Records (EHR) are the foundation of much medical research. However, analyzing the text data of EHRs directly is an challenging task. Therefore, physicians often use questionnaires to first convert text data to structured data. Filling in these questionnaires requires a considerable amount of time and medical knowledge. It is a significant task to develop an algorithm to make computers fill out these questionnaires automatically. This research aims to build a deep learning model that can automatically complete questionnaires with given medical text. This task is a part of Information Extraction (IE), but it differs from the existing tasks of medical IE. Because of the questions in questionnaires are closed-end type, which refers to making a selection among given options, we could treat this task as a classification problem. However, conventional classification algorithms are resource-consuming when filling out one entire questionnaire with one model. They also could not use the question information to guide the questionnaire filling task. To handle these issues, we propose a neural network model based on question answering (QA) framework in this paper. With this framework, our neural network can fill out one complete questionnaire using only one model. We perform experiments on three real-world Chinese medical datasets and related clinical questionnaires. Our model respectively achieves F1 scores of 0.9273, 0.8834, and 0.9846. The results outperform several baseline models. The strong performance of our QA model will allow us to build a system which can help physicians to fill out questionnaires and convert text data to structured data. This system can reduce the workload of physicians.","Ren, Liu, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104225","20201026","EHR; Information extraction; Medical text; Multi-label classification; Question answering","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16606,""
"The 2019 Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) White Paper on Contemporary Grading of Prostate Cancer","Controversies and uncertainty persist in prostate cancer grading. To update grading recommendations. Critical review of the literature along with pathology and clinician surveys. Percent Gleason pattern 4 (%GP4) is as follows: (1) report %GP4 in needle biopsy with Grade Groups (GrGp) 2 and 3, and in needle biopsy on other parts (jars) of lower grade in cases with at least 1 part showing Gleason score (GS) 4 + 4 = 8; and (2) report %GP4: less than 5% or less than 10% and 10% increments thereafter. Tertiary grade patterns are as follows: (1) replace &quot;tertiary grade pattern&quot; in radical prostatectomy (RP) with &quot;minor tertiary pattern 5 (TP5),&quot; and only use in RP with GrGp 2 or 3 with less than 5% Gleason pattern 5; and (2) minor TP5 is noted along with the GS, with the GrGp based on the GS. Global score and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsies are as follows: (1) when multiple undesignated cores are taken from a single MRI-targeted lesion, an overall grade for that lesion is given as if all the involved cores were one long core; and (2) if providing a global score, when different scores are found in the standard and the MRI-targeted biopsy, give a single global score (factoring both the systematic standard and the MRI-targeted positive cores). Grade Groups are as follows: (1) Grade Groups (GrGp) is the terminology adopted by major world organizations; and (2) retain GS 3 + 5 = 8 in GrGp 4. Cribriform carcinoma is as follows: (1) report the presence or absence of cribriform glands in biopsy and RP with Gleason pattern 4 carcinoma. Intraductal carcinoma (IDC-P) is as follows: (1) report IDC-P in biopsy and RP; (2) use criteria based on dense cribriform glands (&gt;50% of the gland is composed of epithelium relative to luminal spaces) and/or solid nests and/or marked pleomorphism/necrosis; (3) it is not necessary to perform basal cell immunostains on biopsy and RP to identify IDC-P if the results would not change the overall (highest) GS/GrGp part per case; (4) do not include IDC-P in determining the final GS/GrGp on biopsy and/or RP; and (5) &quot;atypical intraductal proliferation (AIP)&quot; is preferred for an intraductal proliferation of prostatic secretory cells which shows a greater degree of architectural complexity and/or cytological atypia than typical high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, yet falling short of the strict diagnostic threshold for IDC-P. Molecular testing is as follows: (1) Ki67 is not ready for routine clinical use; (2) additional studies of active surveillance cohorts are needed to establish the utility of PTEN in this setting; and (3) dedicated studies of RNA-based assays in active surveillance populations are needed to substantiate the utility of these expensive tests in this setting. Artificial intelligence and novel grading schema are as follows: (1) incorporating reactive stromal grade, percent GP4, minor tertiary GP5, and cribriform/intraductal carcinoma are not ready for adoption in current practice.","Epstein, Amin, Fine, Algaba, Aron, Baydar, Beltran, Brimo, Cheville, Colecchia, Comperat, da Cunha, Delprado, DeMarzo, Giannico, Gordetsky, Guo, Hansel, Hirsch, Huang, Humphrey, Jimenez, Khani, Kong, Kryvenko, Kunju, Lal, Latour, Lotan, Maclean, Magi-Galluzzi, Mehra, Menon, Miyamoto, Montironi, Netto, Nguyen, Osunkoya, Parwani, Robinson, Rubin, Shah, So, Takahashi, Tavora, Tretiakova, True, Wobker, Yang, Zhou, Zynger, Trpkov","https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0015-RA","20200626","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16607,""

"Semi-Supervised Text Classification Framework: An Overview of Dengue Landscape Factors and Satellite Earth Observation","In recent years there has been an increasing use of satellite Earth observation (EO) data in dengue research, in particular the identification of landscape factors affecting dengue transmission. Summarizing landscape factors and satellite EO data sources, and making the information public are helpful for guiding future research and improving health decision-making. In this case, a review of the literature would appear to be an appropriate tool. However, this is not an easy-to-use tool. The review process mainly includes defining the topic, searching, screening at both title/abstract and full-text levels and data extraction that needs consistent knowledge from experts and is time-consuming and labor intensive. In this context, this study integrates the review process, text scoring, active learning (AL) mechanism, and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and proposes a semi-supervised text classification framework that enables the efficient and accurate selection of the relevant articles. Specifically, text scoring and BiLSTM-based active learning were used to replace the title/abstract screening and full-text screening, respectively, which greatly reduces the human workload. In this study, 101 relevant articles were selected from 4 bibliographic databases, and a catalogue of essential dengue landscape factors was identified and divided into four categories: land use (LU), land cover (LC), topography and continuous land surface features. Moreover, various satellite EO sensors and products used for identifying landscape factors were tabulated. Finally, possible future directions of applying satellite EO data in dengue research in terms of landscape patterns, satellite sensors and deep learning were proposed. The proposed semi-supervised text classification framework was successfully applied in research evidence synthesis that could be easily applied to other topics, particularly in an interdisciplinary context.","Li, Gurgel, Dessay, Hu, Xu, Gong","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124509","20200907","deep active learning; dengue; landscape; natural language processing; satellite Earth observation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16609,""
"Deep Natural Language Processing to Identify Symptom Documentation in Clinical Notes for Patients With Heart Failure Undergoing Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy","Clinicians lack reliable methods to predict which patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) will benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Symptom burden may help to predict response, but this information is buried in free-text clinical notes. Natural language processing (NLP) may identify symptoms recorded in the electronic health record and thereby enable this information to inform clinical decisions about the appropriateness of CRT. To develop, train, and test a deep NLP model that identifies documented symptoms in patients with CHF receiving CRT. We identified a random sample of clinical notes from a cohort of patients with CHF who later received CRT. Investigators labeled documented symptoms as present, absent, and context dependent (pathologic depending on the clinical situation). The algorithm was trained on 80% and fine-tuned parameters on 10% of the notes. We tested the model on the remaining 10%. We compared the model's performance to investigators' annotations using accuracy, precision (positive predictive value), recall (sensitivity), and F1 score (a combined measure of precision and recall). Investigators annotated 154 notes (352,157 words) and identified 1340 present, 1300 absent, and 221 context-dependent symptoms. In the test set of 15 notes (35,467 words), the model's accuracy was 99.4% and recall was 66.8%. Precision was 77.6%, and overall F1 score was 71.8. F1 scores for present (70.8) and absent (74.7) symptoms were higher than that for context-dependent symptoms (48.3). A deep NLP algorithm can be trained to capture symptoms in patients with CHF who received CRT with promising precision and recall.","Leiter, Santus, Jin, Lee, Yusufov, Chien, Ramaswamy, Moseley, Qian, Schrag, Lindvall","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.06.010","20201020","Artificial intelligence; cardiac resynchronization therapy; clinical decision making; heart failure; signs and symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16610,""
"Approaches Based on Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Intelligent Things to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19: Scoping Review","Artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Intelligent Things (IIoT) are promising technologies to prevent the concerningly rapid spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and to maximize safety during the pandemic. With the exponential increase in the number of COVID-19 patients, it is highly possible that physicians and health care workers will not be able to treat all cases. Thus, computer scientists can contribute to the fight against COVID-19 by introducing more intelligent solutions to achieve rapid control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes the disease. The objectives of this review were to analyze the current literature, discuss the applicability of reported ideas for using AI to prevent and control COVID-19, and build a comprehensive view of how current systems may be useful in particular areas. This may be of great help to many health care administrators, computer scientists, and policy makers worldwide. We conducted an electronic search of articles in the MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Embase, and Web of Knowledge databases to formulate a comprehensive review that summarizes different categories of the most recently reported AI-based approaches to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. Our search identified the 10 most recent AI approaches that were suggested to provide the best solutions for maximizing safety and preventing the spread of COVID-19. These approaches included detection of suspected cases, large-scale screening, monitoring, interactions with experimental therapies, pneumonia screening, use of the IIoT for data and information gathering and integration, resource allocation, predictions, modeling and simulation, and robotics for medical quarantine. We found few or almost no studies regarding the use of AI to examine COVID-19 interactions with experimental therapies, the use of AI for resource allocation to COVID-19 patients, or the use of AI and the IIoT for COVID-19 data and information gathering/integration. Moreover, the adoption of other approaches, including use of AI for COVID-19 prediction, use of AI for COVID-19 modeling and simulation, and use of AI robotics for medical quarantine, should be further emphasized by researchers because these important approaches lack sufficient numbers of studies. Therefore, we recommend that computer scientists focus on these approaches, which are still not being adequately addressed.","Adly, Adly, Adly","https://doi.org/10.2196/19104","20200821","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; artificial intelligence; internet of things; machine learning; modeling; novel coronavirus; robotics; simulation; telemedicine; Artificial Intelligence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Humans; Internet; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16611,""
"Development and Implementation of Clinical Outcome Measures for Automated Collection Within Specialty Pharmacy Practice","Johns Hopkins Specialty Pharmacy Services recognized the need to identify and develop standardized collection methods for clinical outcome measures (COMs) to demonstrate program quality and value to third-party payers, manufacturers, and internal stakeholders. To define specialty COMs and develop a framework for standardized data collection and reporting. COMs for specialty pharmacy disease states (cystic fibrosis; hepatitis C; inflammatory conditions in dermatology, gastroenterology and rheumatology; and multiple sclerosis) were identified through a literature search, collaboration with specialty pharmacists, and committee review. Once identified, these measures were distributed to internal and external stakeholders that included specialty clinic team members, drug manufacturers, and third-party payers for input and validation. A standardized process for discrete documentation and data collection of these measures was implemented using case management software, electronic medical record integration, and informatics support. 28 COMs were identified. The various data sources used to collect the COMs were incorporated into an automated virtual dashboard to allow for regular review and sharing with clinicians, leadership, and other key stakeholders. The virtual dashboard included COMs with data derived from electronic medical records (n = 9), patient-reported outcomes based on responses to pharmacist-delivered questions (n = 11), and pharmacist assessment of outcomes (n = 8). The completed virtual dashboard was further refined to allow for reporting of both population and patient-level outcome results on a quarterly basis. This project describes methods to standardize documentation, data collection, and reporting of clinical outcomes data for multiple specialty conditions in a health system-integrated specialty pharmacy program. Through literature review and stakeholder consultation, a variety of potential COMs were identified for further evaluation of feasibility and value considering documentation and data collection requirements. Incorporation of COMs into a virtual dashboard will help facilitate the evaluation of program effectiveness, quality improvement planning, and sharing with stakeholders. Additional opportunities exist to further standardize COMs across the pharmacy industry to allow for future benchmarking and standardized evaluation of patient care programs.

"Revisiting the complex architecture of ALS in Turkey: Expanding genotypes, shared phenotypes, molecular networks, and a public variant database","The last decade has proven that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, and that the genetic component in sporadic cases might be stronger than expected. This study investigates 1,200 patients to revisit ALS in the ethnically heterogeneous yet inbred Turkish population. Familial ALS (fALS) accounts for 20% of our cases. The rates of consanguinity are 30% in fALS and 23% in sporadic ALS (sALS). Major ALS genes explained the disease cause in only 35% of fALS, as compared with ~70% in Europe and North America. Whole exome sequencing resulted in a discovery rate of 42% (53/127). Whole genome analyses in 623 sALS cases and 142 population controls, sequenced within Project MinE, revealed well-established fALS gene variants, solidifying the concept of incomplete penetrance in ALS. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with whole genome sequencing data did not indicate a new risk locus. Coupling GWAS with a coexpression network of disease-associated candidates, points to a significant enrichment for cell cycle- and division-related genes. Within this network, literature text-mining highlights DECR1, ATL1, HDAC2, GEMIN4, and HNRNPA3 as important genes. Finally, information on ALS-related gene variants in the Turkish cohort sequenced within Project MinE was compiled in the GeNDAL variant browser (www.gendal.org).","Tunca, Ã…Å¾eker, AkÃƒÂ§imen, CoÃ…Å¸kun, Bayraktar, Palvadeau, Zor, KoÃƒÂ§oÃ„Å¸lu, Kartal, Ã…Å¾en, Hamzeiy, Ãƒâ€“zoÃ„Å¸uz ErimiÃ…Å¸, Norman, Karakahya, Olgun, AkgÃƒÂ¼n, DurmuÃ…Å¸, Ã…Å¾ahin, Ãƒâ€¡akar, BaÃ…Å¸ar GÃƒÂ¼rsoy, Babacan YÃ„Â±ldÃ„Â±z, Ã„Â°Ã…Å¸ak, UluÃƒÂ§, HanaÃ„Å¸asÃ„Â±, BilgiÃƒÂ§, Turgut, Aysal, ErtaÃ…Å¸, Boz, Kotan, Ã„Â°drisoÃ„Å¸lu, Soysal, Uzun Adatepe, AkalÃ„Â±n, KoÃƒÂ§, Tan, Oflazer, Deymeer, TaÃ…Å¸tan, Ãƒâ€¡iÃƒÂ§ek, Kavak, Parman, BaÃ…Å¸ak","https://doi.org/10.1002/humu.24055","20200728","ALS; ALS variant database; Turkish peninsula; clinical exome sequencing; coexpression network analysis; genetics; genome-wide association study; motor neuron disease; next generation sequencing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16613,""
"Evaluation of Different Learning Algorithms of Neural Networks for Drug Dosing Recommendations in Pediatrics","Publicly accessible databases with evidence-based information on drug dosages for children and adolescents are not available in Germany. In previous work a prototypical web-based online platform for pediatric dosing recommendation has been developed. Quality assured maintenance of such a database is a time consuming effort. Recent work has shown that it is possible to use routinely documented data for machine learning approaches in order to create models for future decision support tools. This work describes the development of a prototype for pediatric dosing recommendations on the basis of routine drug prescriptions. Since they are structured for daily clinical use, not for machine learning, they include a substantial proportion of narrative text that requires preprocessing with consideration of medical and pharmaceutical knowledge. Three different learning algorithms have been applied and compared. The genetic algorithm with backpropagation has achieved the highest accuracy in the predictions. Our study constitutes a first step towards pediatric dosing recommendations, but there are multiple additional steps to be taken before a routine use might be considered, such as an evaluation by experienced physicians.","RÃƒÂ¶dle, Caliskan, Prokosch, Kraus","https://doi.org/10.3233/SHTI200106","20200825","computer; drug dosage calculations; machine learning; neural networks; pediatrics; Adolescent; Algorithms; Child; Germany; Humans; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16614,""
"The composition and capacity of the clinical genetics workforce in high-income countries: a scoping review","As genetics becomes increasingly integrated into all areas of health care and the use of complex genetic tests continues to grow, the clinical genetics workforce will likely face greatly increased demand for its services. To inform strategic planning by health-care systems to prepare to meet this future demand, we performed a scoping review of the genetics workforce in high-income countries, summarizing all available evidence on its composition and capacity published between 2010 and 2019. Five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PAIS, CINAHL, and Web of Science) and gray literature sources were searched, resulting in 162 unique studies being included in the review. The evidence presented includes the composition and size of the workforce, the scope of practice for genetics and nongenetics specialists, the time required to perform genetics-related tasks, case loads of genetics providers, and opportunities to increase efficiency and capacity. Our results indicate that there is currently a shortage of genetics providers and that there is a lack of consensus about the appropriate boundaries between the scopes of practice for genetics and nongenetics providers. Moreover, the results point to strategies that may be used to increase productivity and efficiency, including alternative service delivery models, streamlining processes, and the automation of tasks.","Dragojlovic, Borle, Kopac, Ellis, Birch, Adam, Friedman, Nisselle, Elliott, Lynd, Dragojlovic, Birch, Adam, Friedman, Elliott, Lynd","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-020-0825-2","20200902","clinical geneticist; clinical genetics; genetic counselor; human resources; workforce","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16615,""
"Current Applications, Opportunities, and Limitations of AI for 3D Imaging in Dental Research and Practice","The increasing use of three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques in dental medicine has boosted the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems for various clinical problems. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and intraoral/facial scans are potential sources of image data to develop 3D image-based AI systems for automated diagnosis, treatment planning, and prediction of treatment outcome. This review focuses on current developments and performance of AI for 3D imaging in dentomaxillofacial radiology (DMFR) as well as intraoral and facial scanning. In DMFR, machine learning-based algorithms proposed in the literature focus on three main applications, including automated diagnosis of dental and maxillofacial diseases, localization of anatomical landmarks for orthodontic and orthognathic treatment planning, and general improvement of image quality. Automatic recognition of teeth and diagnosis of facial deformations using AI systems based on intraoral and facial scanning will very likely be a field of increased interest in the future. The review is aimed at providing dental practitioners and interested colleagues in healthcare with a comprehensive understanding of the current trend of AI developments in the field of 3D imaging in dental medicine.","Hung, Yeung, Tanaka, Bornstein","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124424","20201013","AI; ML; artificial intelligence; cone beam computed tomography (CBCT); facial scanning; intraoral scanning; machine learning; Artificial Intelligence; Dental Research; Dentists; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Professional Role","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16616,""
"An Electronic Health Record Text Mining Tool to Collect Real-World Drug Treatment Outcomes: A Validation Study in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma","Real-world evidence can close the inferential gap between marketing authorization studies and clinical practice. However, the current standard for real-world data extraction from electronic health records (EHRs) for treatment evaluation is manual review (MR), which is time-consuming and laborious. Clinical Data Collector (CDC) is a novel natural language processing and text mining software tool for both structured and unstructured EHR data and only shows relevant EHR sections improving efficiency. We investigated CDC as a real-world data (RWD) collection method, through application of CDC queries for patient inclusion and information extraction on a cohort of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) receiving systemic drug treatment. Baseline patient characteristics, disease characteristics, and treatment outcomes were extracted and these were compared with MR for validation. One hundred patients receiving 175 treatments were included using CDC, which corresponded to 99% with MR. Calculated median overall survival was 21.7Ã‚Â months (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.7-24.8) vs. 21.7Ã‚Â months (95% CI 18.6-24.8) and progression-free survival 8.9Ã‚Â months (95% CI 5.4-12.4) vs. 7.6Ã‚Â months (95% CI 5.7-9.4) for CDC vs. MR, respectively. Highest F1-score was found for cancer-related variables (88.1-100), followed by comorbidities (71.5-90.4) and adverse drug events (53.3-74.5), with most diverse scores on international metastatic RCC database criteria (51.4-100). Mean data collection time was 12Ã‚Â minutes (CDC) vs. 86Ã‚Â minutes (MR). In conclusion, CDC is a promising tool for retrieving RWD from EHRs because the correct patient population can be identified as well as relevant outcome data, such as overall survival and progression-free survival.","van Laar, Gombert-Handoko, Guchelaar, Zwaveling","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.1966","20201001","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16617,""
"Task-based characterization of a deep learning image reconstruction and comparison with filtered back-projection and a partial model-based iterative reconstruction in abdominal CT: A phantom study","We aimed to thoroughly characterize image quality of a novel deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR), and investigate its potential for dose reduction in abdominal CT in comparison with filtered back-projection (FBP) and a partial model-based iterative reconstruction (ASiR-V). We scanned a phantom at three dose levels: regular (7Ã‚Â mGy), low (3Ã‚Â mGy) and ultra-low (1Ã‚Â mGy). Images were reconstructed using DLIR (low, medium and high levels) and ASiR-V (0%Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â FBP, 50% and 100%). Noise and contrast-dependent spatial resolution were characterized by computing noise power spectra and target transfer functions, respectively. Detectability indexes of simulated acute appendicitis or colonic diverticulitis (low contrast), and calcium-containing urinary stones (high contrast) (|ÃŽâ€HU|Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 50 and 500, respectively) were calculated using the nonprewhitening with eye filter model observer. At all dose levels, increasing DLIR and ASiR-V levels both markedly decreased noise magnitude compared with FBP, with DLIR low and medium maintaining noise texture overall. For both low- and high-contrast spatial resolution, DLIR not only maintained, but even slightly enhanced spatial resolution in comparison with FBP across all dose levels. Conversely, increasing ASiR-V impaired low-contrast spatial resolution compared with FBP. Overall, DLIR outperformed ASiR-V in all simulated clinical scenarios. For both low- and high-contrast diagnostic tasks, increasing DLIR substantially enhanced detectability at any dose and contrast levels for any simulated lesion size. Unlike ASiR-V, DLIR substantially reduces noise while maintaining noise texture and slightly enhancing spatial resolution overall. DLIR outperforms ASiR-V by enabling higher detectability of both low- and high-contrast simulated abdominal lesions across all investigated dose levels.","Racine, Becce, Viry, Monnin, Thomsen, Verdun, Rotzinger","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2020.06.004","20200824","Computed tomography; Deep learning; Image quality; Iterative reconstruction; Model observer; Radiation dose","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16618,""
"Facial plastic surgery and face recognition algorithms: Interaction and challenges A scoping review and future directions","Face recognition (FR) technology can be used in wide range of applications such as identity authentication, access control, and surveillance. Interests and research activities in face recognition have increased significantly over the past twenty years. Plastic surgery procedures can significantly alter facial appearance, thereby posing a serious challenge even to the state-of-the-art face matching algorithms. The purpose of this work was to detail the interaction between facial plastic surgery and facial recognition software and discuss the new challenges of this interaction. The authors critically reviewed the literature from January 2000 to September 2019, to identify articles reporting interactions between facial plastic surgery and facial recognition algorithms and discuss the new challenges of these interactions. Controlled vocabulary terms and keywords were used in the search strategy and two authors independently analyzed data. Factors included in the analysis were: Author, Journal, Year, Scope, Study design, Plastic surgery, Data (volume, origin and processing), Identification accuracy and Conclusion (interaction/challenge). Forty-three research articles underwent data extraction and 28 articles were included in quantitative synthesis. Of the 28 articles, the most common study designs were experimental evaluation (n=15, 53,5%), Evaluation Study studies (n=7, 25%) and Review studies (n=4, 14,3%). Fifty percent of the articles have been published in the last 4 years (14 articles, 50%). Most of the study scope was informatics (64,3%). Only 10 articles were published in medical journals. Rhytidectomy (face lift) is the most challenging procedure for the FR algorithms. Data volume varied from 4 to 2878 subjects. The proposed algorithms provide at least 15 to 99% better identification performance. Among these, only two papers discuss the new challenges of the interaction between facial plastic surgery and Face Recognition Algorithms. In the context of advances in artificial intelligence, Internet connectivity and data integration, the purpose of this review is, to look forward to analyze the new interactions of facial plastic surgery and facial recognition algorithms, and to suggest avenues for future research and clinical application of this technology. Furthermore, to evaluate if plastic surgeons are prepared to discuss this technology with their patients. Plastic surgeons should be prepared to answer questions from patients about the fundamentals of facial recognition technology, and the potential effects of plastic surgery on facial recognition technology performance. Continued efforts are needed to provide scientifically rigorous data of facial biometric identification after facial plastic surgery and to include these notions in the routine consultation or consent process for patients seeking aesthetic facial surgery.","Bouguila, Khochtali","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jormas.2020.06.007","20200707","Biometry; Face; Face recognition; Plastic surgery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16619,""
"Age-related Macular Degeneration: Nutrition, Genes and Deep Learning-The LXXVI Edward Jackson Memorial Lecture","To evaluate the importance of nutritional supplements, dietary pattern, and genetic associations in age-related macular degeneration (AMD); and to discuss the technique of artificial intelligence/deep learning to potentially enhance research in detecting and classifying AMD. Retrospective literature review. To review the studies of both prospective and retrospective (post hoc) analyses of nutrition, genetic variants, and deep learning in AMD in both the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS2. In addition to demonstrating the beneficial effects of the AREDS and AREDS2 supplements of antioxidant vitamins and zinc (plus copper) for reducing the risk of progression to late AMD, these 2 studies also confirmed the importance of high adherence to Mediterranean diet in reducing progression of AMD in persons with varying severity of disease. In persons with the protective genetic alleles of complement factor H (CFH), the Mediterranean diet had further beneficial effect. However, despite the genetic association with AMD progression, prediction models found genetic information added little to the high predictive value of baseline severity of AMD for disease progression. The technique of deep learning, an arm of artificial intelligence, using color fundus photographs from AREDS/AREDS2 was superior in some cases and noninferior in others to clinical human grading (retinal specialists) and to the gold standard of the certified reading center graders. Counseling individuals affected with AMD regarding the use of the AREDS2 supplements and the beneficial association of the Mediterranean diet is an important public health message. Although genetic testing is important in research, it is not recommended for prediction of disease or to guide therapies and/or dietary interventions in AMD. Techniques in deep learning hold great promise, but further prospective research is required to validate the use of this technique to provide improvement in accuracy and sensitivity/specificity in clinical research and medical management of patients with AMD.","Chew","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2020.05.042","20201006","Deep Learning; Dietary Supplements; Disease Progression; Genetic Testing; Humans; Macular Degeneration; Visual Acuity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16620,""
"Automatic Construction of a Depression-Domain Lexicon Based on Microblogs: Text Mining Study","According to a World Health Organization report in 2017, there was almost one patient with depression among every 20 people in China. However, the diagnosis of depression is usually difficult in terms of clinical detection owing to slow observation, high cost, and patient resistance. Meanwhile, with the rapid emergence of social networking sites, people tend to share their daily life and disclose inner feelings online frequently, making it possible to effectively identify mental conditions using the rich text information. There are many achievements regarding an English web-based corpus, but for research in China so far, the extraction of language features from web-related depression signals is still in a relatively primary stage. The purpose of this study was to propose an effective approach for constructing a depression-domain lexicon. This lexicon will contain language features that could help identify social media users who potentially have depression. Our study also compared the performance of detection with and without our lexicon. We autoconstructed a depression-domain lexicon using Word2Vec, a semantic relationship graph, and the label propagation algorithm. These two methods combined performed well in a specific corpus during construction. The lexicon was obtained based on 111,052 Weibo microblogs from 1868 users who were depressed or nondepressed. During depression detection, we considered six features, and we used five classification methods to test the detection performance. The experiment results showed that in terms of the F1 value, our autoconstruction method performed 1% to 6% better than baseline approaches and was more effective and steadier. When applied to detection models like logistic regression and support vector machine, our lexicon helped the models outperform by 2% to 9% and was able to improve the final accuracy of potential depression detection. Our depression-domain lexicon was proven to be a meaningful input for classification algorithms, providing linguistic insights on the depressive status of test subjects. We believe that this lexicon will enhance early depression detection in people on social media. Future work will need to be carried out on a larger corpus and with more complex methods.","Li, Li, Huang, Hou","https://doi.org/10.2196/17650","20200928","automatic construction; depression detection; depression diagnosis; depression lexicon; domain-specific lexicon; label propagation; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16621,""

"Text-Mining Services of the Swiss Variant Interpretation Platform for Oncology","The Swiss Variant Interpretation Platform for Oncology is a centralized, joint and curated database for clinical somatic variants piloted by a board of Swiss healthcare institutions and operated by the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. To support this effort, SIB Text Mining designed a set of text analytics services. This report focuses on three of those services. First, the automatic annotations of the literature with a set of terminologies have been performed, resulting in a large annotated version of MEDLINE and PMC. Second, a generator of variant synonyms for single nucleotide variants has been developed using publicly available data resources, as well as patterns of non-standard formats, often found in the literature. Third, a literature ranking service enables to retrieve a ranked set of MEDLINE abstracts given a variant and optionally a diagnosis. The annotation of MEDLINE and PMC resulted in a total of respectively 785,181,199 and 1,156,060,212 annotations, which means an average of 26 and 425 annotations per abstract and full-text article. The generator of variant synonyms enables to retrieve up to 42 synonyms for a variant. The literature ranking service reaches a precision (P10) of 63%, which means that almost two-thirds of the top-10 returned abstracts are judged relevant.

"On the Construction of Multilingual Corpora for Clinical Text Mining","The amount of digital data derived from healthcare processes have increased tremendously in the last years. This applies especially to unstructured data, which are often hard to analyze due to the lack of available tools to process and extract information. Natural language processing is often used in medicine, but the majority of tools used by researchers are developed primarily for the English language. For developing and testing natural language processing methods, it is important to have a suitable corpus, specific to the medical domain that covers the intended target language. To improve the potential of natural language processing research, we developed tools to derive language specific medical corpora from publicly available text sources. n order to extract medicine-specific unstructured text data, openly available pub-lications from biomedical journals were used in a four-step process: (1) medical journal databases were scraped to download the articles, (2) the articles were parsed and consolidated into a single repository, (3) the content of the repository was de-scribed, and (4) the text data and the codes were released. In total, 93 969 articles were retrieved, with a word count of 83 868 501 in three different languages (German, English, and Spanish) from two medical journal databases Our results show that unstructured text data extraction from openly available medical journal databases for the construction of unified corpora of medical text data can be achieved through web scraping techniques.","Villena, Eisenmann, Knaup, Dunstan, Ganzinger","https://doi.org/10.3233/SHTI200180","20200825","Data Mining; Information Storage and Retrieval; Linguistics; Medical Informatics; Natural Language Processing; Data Mining; Multilingualism; Natural Language Processing; Unified Medical Language System","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16630,""

"Machine Learning Assisted Citation Screening for Systematic Reviews","Evidence-based practice is highly dependent upon up-to-date systematic reviews (SR) for decision making. However, conducting and updating systematic reviews, especially the citation screening for identification of relevant studies, requires much human work and is therefore expensive. Automating citation screening using machine learning (ML) based approaches can reduce cost and labor.

"Leveraging PubMed to Create a Specialty-Based Sense Inventory for Spanish Acronym Resolution","Acronyms frequently occur in clinical text, which makes their identification, disambiguation and resolution an important task in clinical natural language processing. This paper contributes to acronym resolution in Spanish through the creation of a set of sense inventories organized by clinical specialty containing acronyms, their expansions, and corpus-driven features. The new acronym resource is composed of 51 clinical specialties with 3,603 acronyms in total, from which we identified 228 language independent acronyms and 391 language dependent expansions. We further analyzed the sense inventory across specialties and present novel insights of acronym usage in biomedical Spanish texts.","Pomares-Quimbaya, LÃƒÂ³pez-ÃƒÅ¡beda, Oleynik, Schulz","https://doi.org/10.3233/SHTI200169","20200706","Acronym resolution; Clinical specialties; Natural Language Processing; PubMed; Sense inventory; Spanish; Abbreviations as Topic; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Language; Natural Language Processing; PubMed","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16633,""
"Integration of Unstructured Data into a Clinical Data Warehouse for Kidney Transplant Screening - Challenges &amp; Solutions","After kidney transplantation graft rejection must be prevented. Therefore, a multitude of parameters of the patient is observed pre- and postoperatively. To support this process, the Screen Reject research project is developing a data warehouse optimized for kidney rejection diagnostics. In the course of this project it was discovered that important information are only available in form of free texts instead of structured data and can therefore not be processed by standard ETL tools, which is necessary to establish a digital expert system for rejection diagnostics. Due to this reason, data integration has been improved by a combination of methods from natural language processing and methods from image processing. Based on state-of-the-art data warehousing technologies (Microsoft SSIS), a generic data integration tool has been developed. The tool was evaluated by extracting Banff-classification from 218 pathology reports and extracting HLA mismatches from about 1700 PDF files, both written in german language.","Zubke, Katzensteiner, Bott","https://doi.org/10.3233/SHTI200165","20200706","NLP; data warehouse; graft rejection; image processing; information extraction; kidney transplant; Data Warehousing; Graft Rejection; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Kidney; Kidney Transplantation; Natural Language Processing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16634,""
"End-to-End Approach for Structuring Radiology Reports","Radiology reports include various types of clinical information that are used for patient care. Reports are also expected to have secondary uses (e.g., clinical research and the development of decision support systems). For secondary use, it is necessary to extract information from the report and organize it in a structured format. Our goal is to build an application to transform radiology reports written in a free-text form into a structured format. To this end, we propose an end-to-end method that consists of three elements. First, we built a neural network model to extract clinical information from the reports. We experimented on a dataset of chest X-ray reports. Second, we transformed the extracted information into a structured format. Finally, we built a tool that enabled the transformation of terms in reports to standard forms. Through our end-to-end method, we could obtain a structured radiology dataset that was easy to access for secondary use.","Sugimoto, Takeda, Wada, Yamahata, Konishi, Manabe, Matsumura","https://doi.org/10.3233/SHTI200151","20200706","Information Extraction; Natural Language Processing; Radiology Report; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Neural Networks, Computer; Radiology; Radiology Information Systems; Research Report; Software; Writing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16635,""

"Discovering New Social Determinants of Health Concepts from Unstructured Data: Framework and Evaluation","Social determinants of health (SDoH) are the complex set of circumstances in which individuals are born, or with which they live, that impact their health. Integrating SDoH into practice requires that information systems are able to identify SDoH-related concepts from charts and case notes through vocabularies or terminologies. Despite significant standardisation efforts across healthcare domains, SDoH coverage remains sparse in existing terminologies due to the broad spectrum of this domain, ranging from family relations, risk factors, to social programs and benefits, which are not consistently captured across administrative and clinical settings. This paper presents a framework to mine, evaluate and recommend new multidisciplinary concepts that relate to or impact the health and well-being of individuals using a word embedding model trained from a large dynamic corpus of unstructured data. Five key SDoH domains were selected and evaluated by domain experts. The concepts resulting from the trained model were matched against well-established meta-thesaurus UMLS and terminology SNOMED-CT and, overall, a significant proportion of concepts from a set of 10,000 candidates were not found (31% and 28% respectively). The results confirm both the gaps in current terminologies and the feasibility and impact of the methods presented in this paper for the incremental discovery and validation of new SDoH concepts together with domain experts. This sustainable approach facilitates the development and refinement of new and existing terminologies and, in turn, it allows systems such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotators to leverage SDoH concepts across integrated care settings.","Bettencourt-Silva, Mulligan, Sbodio, Segrave-Daly, Williams, Lopez, Alzate","https://doi.org/10.3233/SHTI200145","20200825","Social Determinants of Health; Terminologies; Vocabularies; Natural Language Processing; Social Determinants of Health; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine; Vocabulary, Controlled","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16637,""

"AD-NET: Age-adjust neural network for improved MCI to AD conversion prediction","The prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients who are at higher risk converting to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is critical for effective intervention and patient selection in clinical trials. Different biomarkers including neuroimaging have been developed to serve the purpose. With extensive methodology development efforts on neuroimaging, an emerging field is deep learning research. One great challenge facing deep learning is the limited medical imaging data available. To address the issue, researchers explore the use of transfer learning to extend the applicability of deep models on neuroimaging research for AD diagnosis and prognosis. Existing transfer learning models mostly focus on transferring the features from the pre-training into the fine-tuning stage. Recognizing the advantages of the knowledge gained during the pre-training, we propose an AD-NET (Age-adjust neural network) with the pre-training model serving two purposes: extracting and transferring features; and obtaining and transferring knowledge. Specifically, the knowledge being transferred in this research is an age-related surrogate biomarker. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, AD-NET is compared with 8 classification models from literature using the same public neuroimaging dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed AD-NET outperforms the competing models in predicting the MCI patients at risk for conversion to the AD stage.","Gao, Yoon, Xu, Goradia, Luo, Wu, Su","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2020.102290","20201025","AD; Biomarker; Deep learning; MCI; Transfer learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16645,""
"FasTag: Automatic text classification of unstructured medical narratives","Unstructured clinical narratives are continuously being recorded as part of delivery of care in electronic health records, and dedicated tagging staff spend considerable effort manually assigning clinical codes for billing purposes. Despite these efforts, however, label availability and accuracy are both suboptimal. In this retrospective study, we aimed to automate the assignment of top-level International Classification of Diseases version 9 (ICD-9) codes to clinical records from human and veterinary data stores using minimal manual labor and feature curation. Automating top-level annotations could in turn enable rapid cohort identification, especially in a veterinary setting. To this end, we trained long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on 52,722 human and 89,591 veterinary records. We investigated the accuracy of both separate-domain and combined-domain models and probed model portability. We established relevant baseline classification performances by training Decision Trees (DT) and Random Forests (RF). We also investigated whether transforming the data using MetaMap Lite, a clinical natural language processing tool, affected classification performance. We showed that the LSTM-RNNs accurately classify veterinary and human text narratives into top-level categories with an average weighted macro F1 score of 0.74 and 0.68 respectively. In the &quot;neoplasia&quot; category, the model trained on veterinary data had a high validation accuracy in veterinary data and moderate accuracy in human data, with F1 scores of 0.91 and 0.70 respectively. Our LSTM method scored slightly higher than that of the DT and RF models. The use of LSTM-RNN models represents a scalable structure that could prove useful in cohort identification for comparative oncology studies. Digitization of human and veterinary health information will continue to be a reality, particularly in the form of unstructured narratives. Our approach is a step forward for these two domains to learn from and inform one another.","Venkataraman, Pineda, Bear Don't Walk Iv, Zehnder, Ayyar, Page, Bustamante, Rivas","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234647","20200826","Animals; Automation; Data Mining; Databases as Topic; Humans; Narrative Medicine; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Species Specificity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16646,""
"Efficacy of bone marrow stem cells combined with core decompression in the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head: A PRISMA-compliant meta-analysis","This study used the meta-analytic approach to assess the safety and treatment efficacy of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) with core decompression (CD) for osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Electronic database of PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang database was searched up to December 26, 2019 for relevant RCTs about combined utilization of BMSCs and CD versus CD alone for ONFH. Gray literature sources were also searched. We conducted a meta-analysis following the guidelines of the Cochrane Reviewer's Handbook. Two independent reviewers performed the data extraction and assessed study quality. Our outcomes included the Harris hip scores (HHS) at 12 months, HHS at 24 months, necrotic area of femoral head, conversion to total hip arthroplasty (THA), visual analog pain scale at final follow-up, and adverse effects. The meta-analysis was performed with Stata 12.0. A total of 15 published studies with 688 patients fulfilled the requirements of inclusion criteria. Across all populations, participants in combined utilization of BMSCs group showed a statistical significance with higher HHS at 12 months (standard mean difference [SMD] 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.77) and 24 months (SMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.77). Similarly, participants in combined utilization of BMSCs group had more advantages in reducing necrotic area of femoral head (SMD -1.05, 95% CI -1.73 to -0.38) and the rate of conversion to THA (risk ratio [RR]Ã¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.53, 95% CI 0.38-0.74, PÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å .000).

"Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Diabetes Care: A Position Statement of the Italian Association of Medical Diabetologists","Since the last decade, most of our daily activities have become digital. Digital health takes into account the ever-increasing synergy between advanced medical technologies, innovation, and digital communication. Thanks to machine learning, we are not limited anymore to a descriptive analysis of the data, as we can obtain greater value by identifying and predicting patterns resulting from inductive reasoning. Machine learning software programs that disclose the reasoning behind a prediction allow for &quot;what-if&quot; models by which it is possible to understand if and how, by changing certain factors, one may improve the outcomes, thereby identifying the optimal behavior. Currently, diabetes care is facing several challenges: the decreasing number of diabetologists, the increasing number of patients, the reduced time allowed for medical visits, the growing complexity of the disease both from the standpoints of clinical and patient care, the difficulty of achieving the relevant clinical targets, the growing burden of disease management for both the health care professional and the patient, and the health care accessibility and sustainability. In this context, new digital technologies and the use of artificial intelligence are certainly a great opportunity. Herein, we report the results of a careful analysis of the current literature and represent the vision of the Italian Association of Medical Diabetologists (AMD) on this controversial topic that, if well used, may be the key for a great scientific innovation. AMD believes that the use of artificial intelligence will enable the conversion of data (descriptive) into knowledge of the factors that &quot;affect&quot; the behavior and correlations (predictive), thereby identifying the key aspects that may establish an improvement of the expected results (prescriptive). Artificial intelligence can therefore become a tool of great technical support to help diabetologists become fully responsible of the individual patient, thereby assuring customized and precise medicine. This, in turn, will allow for comprehensive therapies to be built in accordance with the evidence criteria that should always be the ground for any therapeutic choice.","Musacchio, Giancaterini, Guaita, Ozzello, Pellegrini, Ponzani, Russo, Zilich, de Micheli","https://doi.org/10.2196/16922","20201020","artificial intelligence; big data analytics; clinical decision making; diabetes management; health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16648,""
"Exploring traditional acupuncture point selection patterns for pain control: data mining of randomised controlled clinical trials","The underlying principles of traditional acupuncture point selection for pain control are complex. Analysis of acupuncture treatments from clinical studies may provide us with a potential rule when selecting traditional acupuncture points (hereafter abbreviated as &quot;points&quot;) in treatment protocols for pain control. The aim of this study was to investigate which points were most commonly used to treat pain in randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs). We searched acupuncture treatment regimens in RCTs included in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for pain management. We analysed information on point selection (more than 10 RCTs included) from seven eligible systematic reviews on pain control. The frequency of the points used was calculated and visualised using a human body template. The points most commonly used across diseases were SP6, ST36, LI4 and LR3. However, the most frequently used points varied across individual conditions. For example, the most frequently used points to treat migraine were GB20, LR3, GV20, <i>Taiyang</i>, LI4 and TE5, while the most frequently used points to manage dysmenorrhoea were SP6, CV4, SP8, LR3 and BL32. Both regional and distal points were used for pain management with acupuncture. Our findings suggest that local and segmental/extra-segmental neuromodulation appear to be the most common phenomena for pain control in acupuncture research. Analysis of information on point selection using a data-driven approach may unveil the hidden patterns of traditional acupuncture point utilisation in clinical practice.","Hwang, Lee, Ryu, Lee, Chae","https://doi.org/10.1177/0964528420926173","20200622","acupuncture; data mining; neuromodulation; pain; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16649,""
"Dissecting the Fornix in Basic Memory Processes and Neuropsychiatric Disease: A Review","<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> The fornix is the primary axonal tract of the hippocampus, connecting it to modulatory subcortical structures. This review reveals that fornix damage causes cognitive deficits that closely mirror those resulting from hippocampal lesions. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> We reviewed the literature on the fornix, spanning non-human animal lesion research, clinical case studies of human patients with fornix damage, as well as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) work that evaluates fornix microstructure in vivo. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> The fornix is essential for memory formation because it serves as the conduit for theta rhythms and acetylcholine, as well as providing mnemonic representations to deep brain structures that guide motivated behavior, such as when and where to eat. In rodents and non-human primates, fornix lesions lead to deficits in conditioning, reversal learning, and navigation. In humans, damage to the fornix manifests as anterograde amnesia. DWI research reveals that the fornix plays a key role in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease, and can potentially predict conversion from the former to the latter. Emerging DWI findings link perturbations in this structure to schizophrenia, mood disorders, and eating disorders. Cutting-edge research has investigated how deep brain stimulation of the fornix can potentially attenuate memory loss, control epileptic seizures, and even improve mood. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> The fornix is essential to a fully functioning memory system and is implicated in nearly all neurological functions that rely on the hippocampus. Future research needs to use optimized DWI methods to study the fornix in vivo, which we discuss, given the difficult nature of fornix reconstruction. Impact Statement The fornix is a white matter tract that connects the hippocampus to several subcortical brain regions and is pivotal for episodic memory functioning. Functionally, the fornix transmits essential neurotransmitters, as well as theta rhythms, to the hippocampus. In addition, it is the conduit by which memories guide decisions. The fornix is biomedically important because lesions to this tract result in irreversible anterograde amnesia. Research using in vivo imaging methods has linked fornix pathology to cognitive aging, mild cognitive impairment, psychosis, epilepsy, and, importantly, Alzheimer's Disease.","Benear, Ngo, Olson","https://doi.org/10.1089/brain.2020.0749","20201001","Alzheimer's disease; diffusion imaging; episodic memory; fornix; hippocampus; white matter","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16650,""

"Exploring the mechanism of TCM formulae in the treatment of different types of coronary heart disease by network pharmacology and machining learning","Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has long been used in the clinical treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD). TCM is characterized by syndrome-based medication, which is, using different TCM formulae for different syndromes. However, the underlying mode of action remains unclear. In this work, we utilized network pharmacology and machine learning to explore the mechanism of eight classic TCM formulae in the treatment of different types of CHD. First, by integrating multiple databases, a total of 669 potential bioactive compounds and 581 targets of the eight formulae were screened. Then, the effectiveness of these formulae on CHD was evaluated using two network-based indicators. The results showed that each formula's targets were significantly correlated with CHD associated genes and overlapped with the targets of 9 classes of drugs for cardio vascular diseases (CVD) to some degree. Next, from 5 different levels, i.e., herb, symptom, compound, target, and pathway level, we systematically compared the eight formulae using network clustering and hierarchical clustering. We found that all the formulae could be grouped into five clusters and the clustering results were approximately consistent at different levels. All the formulae were involved in 7 pathways closely related to CHD and may exhibit the common effect of relieving angina. Formulae in the same group collectively regulated some unique pathways and suggest further specific indications. For example, the three formulae used for Qi stagnation and blood stasis, Qi deficiency and blood stasis, and Qi-Yin deficiency syndromes acted on two special pathways (TNF signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway) and may exert anti-inflammatory and immune-enhancing effects; the two formulae for Yin deficiency of heart and kidney, and Yang deficiency of heart and kidney syndromes regulated two special pathways (PPAR signaling pathway, thyroid hormone signaling pathway) in endocrine system and could improve renal function. Subsequently, we designed a rank algorithm, which integrated network topology with biological function, to identify important targets of these formulae. The results were consistent with the multi-level clustering results. At last, our literature mining validated about 20 % putative targets, as well as clustering results and effects of the formulae by experimental evidences. This study explained the medication patterns and scientific significance of TCM formulae on different types of CHD from perspective of systems biology. It may facilitate the understanding of different types of CHD described by traditional Chinese medicine from the perspectives of modern biology.","Yang, Tian, Zhao, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105034","20200923","Coronary heart disease; Machine learning; Modern medicine symptom; Network pharmacology; TCM syndrome; Traditional Chinese medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16652,""
"Machine learning guided association of adverse drug reactions with in vitro target-based pharmacology","Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in health care. Understanding which drug targets are linked to ADRs can lead to the development of safer medicines. Here, we analyse in vitro secondary pharmacology of common (off) targets for 2134 marketed drugs. To associate these drugs with human ADRs, we utilized FDA Adverse Event Reports and developed random forest models that predict ADR occurrences from in vitro pharmacological profiles. By evaluating Gini importance scores of model features, we identify 221 target-ADR associations, which co-occur in PubMed abstracts to a greater extent than expected by chance. Amongst these are established relations, such as the association of in vitro hERG binding with cardiac arrhythmias, which further validate our machine learning approach. Evidence on bile acid metabolism supports our identification of associations between the Bile Salt Export Pump and renal, thyroid, lipid metabolism, respiratory tract and central nervous system disorders. Unexpectedly, our model suggests PDE3 is associated with 40 ADRs. These associations provide a comprehensive resource to support drug development and human biology studies.

"Strategies to optimize implementation of novel preceptorship models: Peer-assisted learning and near-peer teaching","Hospital experiential placements have traditionally used a 1:1 (student to preceptor) ratio. Two models, peer-assisted learning (PAL) and near-peer teaching (NPT), have been described in the literature for education of health professions. This research explored the use of PAL and NPT, as well as advantages, challenges, and strategies to address challenges for implementation. This study used an anonymous survey to solicit feedback from staff pharmacists and pharmacy leaders about their use of PAL and NPT models in hospital settings in Alberta, Canada. Using closed and open-ended questions, experience with each model and implementation considerations were explored. The survey was completed by 115 hospital pharmacists (11% response rate). PAL and NPT were utilized by 25% and 8% of respondents, respectively, and 10% had experience with both models. Advantages of these models include promoting teamwork and clinical independence, learners supporting each other, and fostering active learning. The highest ranked challenges were space/technology/computer access limitations and additional time to complete learner assessments. Many strategies were provided to address challenges, and facilitate implementation and utilization. In the hospital setting, pharmacists used PAL more commonly than NPT. Feedback from pharmacists and leaders affirmed the advantages and challenges associated with use of these precepting models. Strategies to facilitate and optimize use were provided, which will guide faculty, pharmacy leaders, and preceptors in efforts to support implementation to increase capacity and expand the practice of precepting.","MacDonald, Thompson, Ton, Mysak","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cptl.2020.04.001","20200622","Near peer teaching; Peer assisted learning; Precepting models; Preceptorship/preceptors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16654,""
"Artificial Neural Networks in Cardiovascular Diseases and its Potential for Clinical Application in Molecular Imaging","In medical imaging, Artificial Intelligence is described as the ability of a system to properly interpret and learn from external data, acquiring knowledge to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation. The number of possible applications of Artificial Intelligence is huge also in clinical medicine and in cardiovascular diseases. To describe for the first time in literature, the main results of articles about Artificial Intelligence potential for clinical applications in molecular imaging techniques, and to describe its advancements in cardiovascular diseases assessed with nuclear medicine imaging modalities. A comprehensive search strategy was used based on SCOPUS and PubMed databases. From all studies published in English, we selected the most relevant articles that evaluated the technological insights of AI in nuclear cardiology applications. Artificial Intelligence may improve the patient care on many different fields, from the semi-automatization of the medical work, through the technical aspect of image preparation, interpretation, the calculation of additional factors based on data obtained during scanning, to the prognostic prediction and risk-group selection. Myocardial implementation of Artificial Intelligence algorithms in nuclear cardiology can improve and facilitate the diagnostic and predictive process, and global patient care. Building large databases containing clinical and image data is a first but essential step to create and train automated diagnostic/prognostic models able to help the clinicians to make unbiased and faster decisions for precision healthcare.","Laudicella, Comelli, Stefano, Szostek, CrocÃƒÂ¨, Vento, Spataro, Comis, La Torre, Gaeta, Baldari, Alongi","https://doi.org/10.2174/1874471013666200621191259","20200622","CT; Medical imaging; SPECT; artificial intelligence; deep learning; nuclear cardiology ; radiomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16655,""
"COVID-19 and anosmia: A review based on up-to-date knowledge","The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a vast disaster throughout the world. There is increasing evidence that olfactory dysfunction can present in COVID-19 patients. Anosmia can occur alone or can be accompanied by other symptoms of COVID-19, such as a dry cough. However, the pathogenic mechanism of olfactory dysfunction and its clinical characteristics in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. Multiple cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that the incidence rate of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients varies from 33.9-68% with female dominance. Anosmia and dysgeusia are often comorbid in COVID-19 patients. Otolaryngologists should be mindful of the symptom of anosmia in outpatients so as not to delay the diagnosis of COVID-19.

"Targeted estimation of heterogeneous treatment effect in observational survival analysis","The aim of clinical effectiveness research using repositories of electronic health records is to identify what health interventions 'work best' in real-world settings. Since there are several reasons why the net benefit of intervention may differ across patients, current comparative effectiveness literature focuses on investigating heterogeneous treatment effect and predicting whether an individual might benefit from an intervention. The majority of this literature has concentrated on the estimation of the effect of treatment on binary outcomes. However, many medical interventions are evaluated in terms of their effect on future events, which are subject to loss to follow-up. In this study, we describe a framework for the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effect in terms of differences in time-to-event (survival) probabilities. We divide the problem into three phases: (1) estimation of treatment effect conditioned on unique sets of the covariate vector; (2) identification of features important for heterogeneity using non-parametric variable importance methods; and (3) estimation of treatment effect on the reference classes defined by the previously selected features, using one-step Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We conducted a series of simulation studies and found that this method performs well when either sample size or event rate is high enough and the number of covariates contributing to the effect heterogeneity is moderate. An application of this method to a clinical case study was conducted by estimating the effect of oral anticoagulants on newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink.","Zhu, Gallego","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103474","20200720","Heterogeneous treatment effect; Machine learning; Oral anticoagulants; Survival analysis; Targeted maximum likelihood estimation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16657,""
"Understanding spatial language in radiology: Representation framework, annotation, and spatial relation extraction from chest X-ray reports using deep learning","Radiology reports contain a radiologist's interpretations of images, and these images frequently describe spatial relations. Important radiographic findings are mostly described in reference to an anatomical location through spatial prepositions. Such spatial relationships are also linked to various differential diagnoses and often described through uncertainty phrases. Structured representation of this clinically significant spatial information has the potential to be used in a variety of downstream clinical informatics applications. Our focus is to extract these spatial representations from the reports. For this, we first define a representation framework based on the Spatial Role Labeling (SpRL) scheme, which we refer to as Rad-SpRL. In Rad-SpRL, common radiological entities tied to spatial relations are encoded through four spatial roles: Trajector, Landmark, Diagnosis, and Hedge, all identified in relation to a spatial preposition (or Spatial Indicator). We annotated a total of 2,000 chest X-ray reports following Rad-SpRL. We then propose a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) method involving word and character-level encodings to first extract the Spatial Indicators followed by identifying the corresponding spatial roles. Specifically, we use a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) conditional random field (CRF) neural network as the baseline model. Additionally, we incorporate contextualized word representations from pre-trained language models (BERT and XLNet) for extracting the spatial information. We evaluate both gold and predicted Spatial Indicators to extract the four types of spatial roles. The results are promising, with the highest average F1 measure for Spatial Indicator extraction being 91.29 (XLNet); the highest average overall F1 measure considering all the four spatial roles being 92.9 using gold Indicators (XLNet); and 85.6 using predicted Indicators (BERT pre-trained on MIMIC notes).

"Accuracy of artificial intelligence-assisted detection of upper GI lesions: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted detection is increasingly used in upper endoscopy. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the diagnostic accuracy of AI on detection of gastric and esophageal neoplastic lesions and Helicobacter pylori (HP) status. We searched Embase, PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases for studies on AI detection of gastric or esophageal neoplastic lesions and HP status. After assessing study quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool, a bivariate meta-analysis following a random-effects model was used to summarize the data and plot hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic curves. The diagnostic accuracy was determined by the area under the hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). Twenty-three studies including 969,318 images were included. The AUC of AI detection of neoplastic lesions in the stomach, Barrett's esophagus, and squamous esophagus and HP status were .96 (95% confidence interval [CI], .94-.99), .96 (95% CI, .93-.99), .88 (95% CI, .82-.96), and .92 (95% CI, .88-.97), respectively. AI using narrow-band imaging was superior to white-light imaging on detection of neoplastic lesions in squamous esophagus (.92 vs .83, PÃ‚Â &lt; .001). The performance of AI was superior to endoscopists in the detection of neoplastic lesions in the stomach (AUC, .98 vs .87; PÃ‚Â &lt; .001), Barrett's esophagus (AUC, .96 vs .82; PÃ‚Â &lt; .001), and HP status (AUC, .90 vs .82; PÃ‚Â &lt; .001).

"Epileptic seizure detection using EEG signals and extreme gradient boosting","The problem of automated seizure detection is treated using clinical electroencephalograms (EEG) and machine learning algorithms on the Temple University Hospital EEG Seizure Corpus (TUSZ). Performances on this complex data set are still not encountering expectations. The purpose of this work is to determine to what extent the use of larger amount of data can help to improve the performances. Two methods are explored: a standard partitioning on a recent and larger version of the TUSZ, and a leave-one-out approach used to increase the amount of data for the training set. XGBoost, a fast implementation of the gradient boosting classifier, is the ideal algorithm for these tasks. The performances obtained are in the range of what is reported until now in the literature with deep learning models. We give interpretation to our results by identifying the most relevant features and analyzing performances by seizure types. We show that generalized seizures tend to be far better predicted than focal ones. We also notice that some EEG channels and features are more important than others to distinguish seizure from background.","Vanabelle, De Handschutter, El Tahry, Benjelloun, Boukhebouze","https://doi.org/10.7555/JBR.33.20190016","20200928","Temple University Hospital EEG Seizure Corpus; XGBoost; electroencephalograms; epileptic seizure; machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16660,""
"Artificial intelligence-based tools to control healthcare associated infections: A systematic review of the literature","Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are the most frequent adverse events in healthcare and a global public health concern. Surveillance is the foundation for effective HAIs prevention and control. Manual surveillance is labor intensive, costly and lacks standardization. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) might support the development of HAI surveillance algorithms aimed at understanding HAIs risk factors, improve patient risk stratification, identification of transmission pathways, timely or real-time detection. Scant evidence is available on AI and ML implementation in the field of HAIs and no clear patterns emerges on its impact. We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines to systematically retrieve, quantitatively pool and critically appraise the available evidence on the development, implementation, performance and impact of ML-based HAIs detection models. Of 3445 identified citations, 27 studies were included in the review, the majority published in the US (n=15, 55.6%) and on surgical site infections (SSI, n=8, 29.6%). Only 1 randomized controlled trial was included. Within included studies, 17 (63%) ML approaches were classified as predictive and 10 (37%) as retrospective. Most of the studies compared ML algorithms' performance with non-ML logistic regression statistical algorithms, 18.5% compared different ML models' performance, 11.1% assessed ML algorithms' performance in comparison with clinical diagnosis scores, 11.1% with standard or automated surveillance models. Overall, there is moderate evidence that ML-based models perform equal or better as compared to non-ML approaches and that they reach relatively high-performance standards. However, heterogeneity amongst the studies is very high and did not dissipate significantly in subgroup analyses, by type of infection or type of outcome. Available evidence mainly focuses on the development and testing of HAIs detection and prediction models, while their adoption and impact for research, healthcare quality improvement, or national surveillance purposes is still far from being explored.","Scardoni, Balzarini, Signorelli, Cabitza, Odone","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.06.006","20200803","Artificial intelligence; Healthcare-associated infections (HAI); Infection control; Machine learning; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16661,""
"Computer-aided therapeutic diagnosis for anorexia","Anorexia nervosa is a clinical disorder syndrome of the wide spectrum without a fully recognized etiology. The necessary issue in the clinical diagnostic process is to detect the causes of this disease (e.g., my body image, food, family, peers), which the therapist gradually comes to by verifying assumptions using proper methods and tools for diagnostic process. When a person is diagnosed with anorexia, a clinician (a doctor, a therapist or a psychologist) proposes a therapeutic diagnosis and considers the kind of treatment that should be applied. This process is also continued during therapeutic diagnosis. In both cases, it is recommended to apply computer-aided tools designed for testing and confirming the assumptions made by a psychologist. The paper aims to present the computer-aided therapeutic diagnosis method for anorexia. The proposed method consists of 4 stages: free statements of a patient about his/her body image, the general sentiment analysis of statement based on Recurrent Neural Network, assessment of the intensity of five basic emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, fear and disgust (using the Nencki Affective Word List and conversion of words to their basic form), and the assessment of particular areas of difficulties-the sentiment analysis based on the dictionary approach was applied. The sentiment analysis of a document achieved 72% and 51% of effectiveness, respectively, for RNN and dictionary-based methods. The intensity of sadness (emotion) occurring within the dictionary method is differentiated between control and research group at the level of 10%. The quick access to the sentiment analysis of a statement on the image of patient's body, emotions experienced by the patient and particular areas of difficulties of people prone to the anorexia nervosa disorders, may help to establish the diagnosis in a very short time and start an immediate therapy. The proposed automatic method helps to avoid patient's aversions towards the therapy, which may include avoiding patient-therapist communication, talking about less essential topics, coming late for the sessions. These circumstances can guarantee promising prognosis for recovering.","Spinczyk, Bas, DzieciÃ„â€¦tko, MaÃ„â€¡kowski, Rojewska, MaÃ„â€¡kowska","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12938-020-00798-9","20200623","Affective verbal stimuli; Anorexia nervosa; Emotion; Nencki Affective Word List; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment dictionary; Text classifiers; Text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16662,""
"Automated Classification of Significant Prostate Cancer on MRI: A Systematic Review on the Performance of Machine Learning Applications","Significant prostate carcinoma (sPCa) classification based on MRI using radiomics or deep learning approaches has gained much interest, due to the potential application in assisting in clinical decision-making. To systematically review the literature (i) to determine which algorithms are most frequently used for sPCa classification, (ii) to investigate whether there exists a relation between the performance and the method or the MRI sequences used, (iii) to assess what study design factors affect the performance on sPCa classification, and (iv) to research whether performance had been evaluated in a clinical setting Methods: The databases Embase and Ovid MEDLINE were searched for studies describing machine learning or deep learning classification methods discriminating between significant and nonsignificant PCa on multiparametric MRI that performed a valid validation procedure. Quality was assessed by the modified radiomics quality score. We computed the median area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) from overall methods and the interquartile range. From 2846 potentially relevant publications, 27 were included. The most frequent algorithms used in the literature for PCa classification are logistic regression (22%) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (22%). The median AUC was 0.79 (interquartile range: 0.77-0.87). No significant effect of number of included patients, image sequences, or reference standard on the reported performance was found. Three studies described an external validation and none of the papers described a validation in a prospective clinical trial.

"Machine learning and natural language processing methods to identify ischemic stroke, acuity and location from radiology reports","Accurate, automated extraction of clinical stroke information from unstructured text has several important applications. ICD-9/10 codes can misclassify ischemic stroke events and do not distinguish acuity or location. Expeditious, accurate data extraction could provide considerable improvement in identifying stroke in large datasets, triaging critical clinical reports, and quality improvement efforts. In this study, we developed and report a comprehensive framework studying the performance of simple and complex stroke-specific Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) methods to determine presence, location, and acuity of ischemic stroke from radiographic text. We collected 60,564 Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Radiology reports from 17,864 patients from two large academic medical centers. We used standard techniques to featurize unstructured text and developed neurovascular specific word GloVe embeddings. We trained various binary classification algorithms to identify stroke presence, location, and acuity using 75% of 1,359 expert-labeled reports. We validated our methods internally on the remaining 25% of reports and externally on 500 radiology reports from an entirely separate academic institution. In our internal population, GloVe word embeddings paired with deep learning (Recurrent Neural Networks) had the best discrimination of all methods for our three tasks (AUCs of 0.96, 0.98, 0.93 respectively). Simpler NLP approaches (Bag of Words) performed best with interpretable algorithms (Logistic Regression) for identifying ischemic stroke (AUC of 0.95), MCA location (AUC 0.96), and acuity (AUC of 0.90). Similarly, GloVe and Recurrent Neural Networks (AUC 0.92, 0.89, 0.93) generalized better in our external test set than BOW and Logistic Regression for stroke presence, location and acuity, respectively (AUC 0.89, 0.86, 0.80). Our study demonstrates a comprehensive assessment of NLP techniques for unstructured radiographic text. Our findings are suggestive that NLP/ML methods can be used to discriminate stroke features from large data cohorts for both clinical and research-related investigations.","Ong, Orfanoudaki, Zhang, Caprasse, Hutch, Ma, Fard, Balogun, Miller, Minnig, Saglam, Prescott, Greer, Smirnakis, Bertsimas","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234908","20200901","Brain Ischemia; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Patient Acuity; Speech Recognition Software; Stroke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16664,""
"Noonan syndrome on the African Continent","Noonan syndrome is a common genetic syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in genes in the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. The medical literature has an abundance of studies on Noonan syndrome, but few are from the African continent. The medical literature was searched for studies on Noonan syndrome from the African continent and these reports were added to our experience in Africa. Facial analysis was reviewed from two previous reports from our group using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and an analysis using the Face2Gene convolutional neural network technology. Individuals with Noonan syndrome from reports in African populations have the classic phenotype characteristics including typical minor facial anomalies such as widely spaced eyes (31-100%), short stature (71-100%), and congenital heart disease with pulmonary stenosis found in 24-100% of patients. Similarly, the genotypes are similar with the majority of variants occurring in the gene PTPN11 (72%) and 36% of these variants occurred in the amino acid residue Asn308, which is most commonly found in other populations. The two separate facial analysis algorithms successfully discriminated Africans with NS from unaffected matched individuals with area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic of 0.94 (SVM) and 0.979 for the Face2Gene research methodology. Few studies characterizing Noonan syndrome in Africans have been conducted, highlighting the need for more genetic and genomic research in African populations.

"A preliminary study to quantitatively evaluate the development of maturation degree for fetal lung based on transfer learning deep model from ultrasound images","The evaluation of fetal lung maturity is critical for clinical practice since the lung immaturity is an important cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. For the evaluation of the development of fetal lung maturation degree, our study established a deep model from ultrasound images of four-cardiac-chamber view plane. A two-stage transfer learning approach is proposed for the purpose of the study. A specific U-net structure is designed for the applied deep model. In the first stage, the model is to first learn the recognition of fetal lung region in the ultrasound images. It is hypothesized in our study that the development of fetal lung maturation degree is generally proportional to the gestational age. Then, in the second stage, the pretrained deep model is trained to accurately estimate the gestational age from the fetal lung region of ultrasound images. Totally 332 patients were included in our study, while the first 206 patients were used for training and the subsequent 126 patients were used for the independent testing. The testing results of the established deep model have the imprecision as 1.56Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.17Ã‚Â weeks on the gestational age estimation. Its correlation coefficient with the ground truth of gestational age achieves 0.7624 (95% CI 0.6779 to 0.8270, P valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00001). The hypothesis that the development of fetal lung maturation degree can be represented by the texture information from ultrasound images has been preliminarily validated. The fetal lung maturation degree can be considered as being represented by the deep model's output denoted by the estimated gestational age.","Chen, Chen, Deng, Wang, He, Lv, Yu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02211-1","20200713","Deep model; Development of maturation degree; Fetal lung; Gestational age estimation; Transfer learning; Ultrasound image","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16667,""
"Facing complications of direct anterior approach in total hip arthroplasty during the learning curve","This study aims to evaluate complications and early postoperative clinical outcomes of direct anterior approach (DAA) in total hip arthroplasty (THA). Ninety-one consecutive patients who underwent primary elective unilateral THA between January 2013 and December 2019 were identified. Collected data included age of patient, BMI, ASA score, EBL (estimated blood loss), LOS (length of stay), operating time, and intra/postoperative complications. The recorded complications included prolonged wound drainage without infection, superficial and deep infection, dislocation, periprosthetic fracture, aseptic loosening or failure of osteointegration and nervous damage. Any reoperation, with or without prosthetic component revision, was recorded. Fourteen complications (15,4%) and 12 (13,18%) postoperative anemizations were observed in this series. No deep infection was reported. Most common complications were nerve damage (3/91;3,29%), greater trochanter fracture (3/91; 3,29%), and wound trouble (3/91; 3,29%). Two (2,19%) dislocations were reported. One (1,09%) intraoperative periprosthetic fracture was treated with cerclage wiring. One (1,09%) revision was needed for an acetabular mobilization. One patient (1,09%) had severe periprosthetic ectopic ossifications (Brooker 4), needing reintervention because of severe limitations of the range of motion (ROM). Complications rate in this study with THA by DAA is comparable to those reported in literature. DAA is a safe, efficient procedure but it needs a steep learning curve.

"Early warning score validation methodologies and performance metrics: a systematic review","Early warning scores (EWS) have been developed as clinical prognostication tools to identify acutely deteriorating patients. In the past few years, there has been a proliferation of studies that describe the development and validation of novel machine learning-based EWS. Systematic reviews of published studies which focus on evaluating performance of both well-established and novel EWS have shown conflicting conclusions. A possible reason is the heterogeneity in validation methods applied. In this review, we aim to examine the methodologies and metrics used in studies which perform EWS validation. A systematic review of all eligible studies from the MEDLINE database and other sources, was performed. Studies were eligible if they performed validation on at least one EWS and reported associations between EWS scores and inpatient mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) transfers, or cardiac arrest (CA) of adults. Two reviewers independently did a full-text review and performed data abstraction by using standardized data-worksheet based on the TRIPOD (Transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) checklist. Meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity. The key differences in validation methodologies identified were (1) validation dataset used, (2) outcomes of interest, (3) case definition, time of EWS use and aggregation methods, and (4) handling of missing values. In terms of case definition, among the 48 eligible studies, 34 used the patient episode case definition while 12 used the observation set case definition, and 2 did the validation using both case definitions. Of those that used the patient episode case definition, 18 studies validated the EWS at a single point of time, mostly using the first recorded observation. The review also found more than 10 different performance metrics reported among the studies. Methodologies and performance metrics used in studies performing validation on EWS were heterogeneous hence making it difficult to interpret and compare EWS performance. Standardizing EWS validation methodology and reporting can potentially address this issue.","Fang, Lim, Balakrishnan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-01144-8","20200807","Early warning score; Methodology; Validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16670,""
"Personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic for oculofacial plastic and orbital surgery","To review the current literature on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) virology and transmission; to present a decision tree for risk stratifying oculofacial plastic and orbital surgeries; and to generate personal protective equipment (PPE) recommendations by risk category. A comprehensive literature review on COVID-19 was conducted. A two-stage modified Delphi technique involving 18 oculofacial plastic and orbital surgeons across Canada was used to determine consensus risk-stratification criteria and PPE recommendations for surgeries performed in the North American context. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We summarize COVID-19 virology and transmission, as well as practice considerations for oculofacial plastic and orbital surgeons. Although SARS-CoV-2 is known to be transmitted predominantly by droplet mechanisms, some studies suggest that transmission is possible through aerosols. Among common procedures performed by oculofacial and plastic surgeons, some are likely to be considered aerosol-generating. Risk of transmission increases when manipulating structures known to harbor high viral loads. We present an algorithm for risk-stratification based on the nature of surgery and the anatomical sites involved and offer recommendations for PPE. Although universal droplet precautions are now recommended in most healthcare settings, some clinical situations require more stringent infection control measures. By highlighting high-risk scenarios specific to oculofacial plastic and orbital surgery, as well as PPE recommendations, we hope to enhance the safety of continued care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Daigle, Leung, Yin, Kalin-Hajdu, Nijhawan","https://doi.org/10.1080/01676830.2020.1781200","20200619","COVID-19; equipment; personal; protective; surgery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16671,""
"COVID-19-CT-CXR: a freely accessible and weakly labeled chest X-ray and CT image collection on COVID-19 from biomedical literature","The latest threat to global health is the COVID-19 outbreak. Although there exist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans, few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy. At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the biomedical literature. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset. We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in the article and separated compound figures into subfigures. We also designed a deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute to improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza and trained a DL baseline to distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of diseases on CT. (3) We trained an unsupervised one-class classifier from non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4) From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared clinical symptoms and clinical findings of COVID-19 vs. those of influenza to demonstrate the disease differences in the scientific publications. We believe that our work is complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Empirical assessment of bias in machine learning diagnostic test accuracy studies","Machine learning (ML) diagnostic tools have significant potential to improve health care. However, methodological pitfalls may affect diagnostic test accuracy studies used to appraise such tools. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and reporting of design characteristics within the literature. Further, we sought to empirically assess whether design features may be associated with different estimates of diagnostic accuracy. We systematically retrieved 2 Ãƒâ€” 2 tables (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°281) describing the performance of ML diagnostic tools, derived from 114 publications in 38 meta-analyses, from PubMed. Data extracted included test performance, sample sizes, and design features. A mixed-effects metaregression was run to quantify the association between design features and diagnostic accuracy. Participant ethnicity and blinding in test interpretation was unreported in 90% and 60% of studies, respectively. Reporting was occasionally lacking for rudimentary characteristics such as study design (28% unreported). Internal validation without appropriate safeguards was used in 44% of studies. Several design features were associated with larger estimates of accuracy, including having unreported (relative diagnostic odds ratio [RDOR], 2.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-3.1) or case-control study designs (RDOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.97-1.66), and recruiting participants for the index test (RDOR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.08-2.59). Significant underreporting of experimental details was present. Study design features may affect estimates of diagnostic performance in the ML diagnostic test accuracy literature. The present study identifies pitfalls that threaten the validity, generalizability, and clinical value of ML diagnostic tools and provides recommendations for improvement.","Crowley, Tan, Ioannidis","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa075","20200722","bias; diagnostic techniques and procedures; machine learning; research design; sensitivity and specificity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16673,""
"Lung Nodule Sizes Are Encoded When Scaling CT Image for CNN's","Noninvasive diagnosis of lung cancer in early stages is one task where radiomics helps. Clinical practice shows that the size of a nodule has high predictive power for malignancy. In the literature, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become widely used in medical image analysis. We study the ability of a CNN to capture nodule size in computed tomography images after images are resized for CNN input. For our experiments, we used the National Lung Screening Trial data set. Nodules were labeled into 2 categories (small/large) based on the original size of a nodule. After all extracted patches were re-sampled into 100-by-100-pixel images, a CNN was able to successfully classify test nodules into small- and large-size groups with high accuracy. To show the generality of our discovery, we repeated size classification experiments using Common Objects in Context (COCO) data set. From the data set, we selected 3 categories of images, namely, bears, cats, and dogs. For all 3 categories a 5- Ãƒâ€” 2-fold cross-validation was performed to put them into small and large classes. The average area under receiver operating curve is 0.954, 0.952, and 0.979 for the bear, cat, and dog categories, respectively. Thus, camera image rescaling also enables a CNN to discover the size of an object.

"Deep Learning for Accurate Diagnosis of Liver Tumor Based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Clinical Data","<b>Background:</b> Early-stage diagnosis and treatment can improve survival rates of liver cancer patients. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI provides the most comprehensive information for differential diagnosis of liver tumors. However, MRI diagnosis is affected by subjective experience, so deep learning may supply a new diagnostic strategy. We used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop a deep learning system (DLS) to classify liver tumors based on enhanced MR images, unenhanced MR images, and clinical data including text and laboratory test results. <b>Methods:</b> Using data from 1,210 patients with liver tumors (<i>N</i> = 31,608 images), we trained CNNs to get seven-way classifiers, binary classifiers, and three-way malignancy-classifiers (Model A-Model G). Models were validated in an external independent extended cohort of 201 patients (<i>N</i> = 6,816 images). The area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were compared across different models. We also compared the sensitivity and specificity of models with the performance of three experienced radiologists. <b>Results:</b> Deep learning achieves a performance on par with three experienced radiologists on classifying liver tumors in seven categories. Using only unenhanced images, CNN performs well in distinguishing malignant from benign liver tumors (AUC, 0.946; 95% CI 0.914-0.979 vs. 0.951; 0.919-0.982, <i>P</i> = 0.664). New CNN combining unenhanced images with clinical data greatly improved the performance of classifying malignancies as hepatocellular carcinoma (AUC, 0.985; 95% CI 0.960-1.000), metastatic tumors (0.998; 0.989-1.000), and other primary malignancies (0.963; 0.896-1.000), and the agreement with pathology was 91.9%.These models mined diagnostic information in unenhanced images and clinical data by deep-neural-network, which were different to previous methods that utilized enhanced images. The sensitivity and specificity of almost every category in these models reached the same high level compared to three experienced radiologists. <b>Conclusion:</b> Trained with data in various acquisition conditions, DLS that integrated these models could be used as an accurate and time-saving assisted-diagnostic strategy for liver tumors in clinical settings, even in the absence of contrast agents. DLS therefore has the potential to avoid contrast-related side effects and reduce economic costs associated with current standard MRI inspection practices for liver tumor patients.","Zhen, Cheng, Tao, Wang, Juengpanich, Jiang, Jiang, Yan, Lu, Lue, Qian, Wu, Sun, Lin, Cai","https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.00680","20200928","MRI; artificial intelligence; deep learning; diagnosis; liver cancer; liver mass","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16675,""
"Quantified Self-Using Consumer Wearable Device: Predicting Physical and Mental Health","Recently, wearable device technology has gained more popularity in supporting a healthy lifestyle. Hence, researchers have begun to put significant efforts into studying the direct and indirect benefits of wearable devices for health and wellbeing. This paper summarizes recent studies on the use of consumer wearable devices to improve physical activity, mental health, and health consciousness. A thorough literature search was performed from several reputable databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, arXiv, and bioRxiv mainly using &quot;wearable device research&quot; as a keyword, no earlier than 2018. As a result, 25 of the most recent and relevant papers included in this review cover several topics, such as previous literature reviews (9 papers), wearable device accuracy (3 papers), self-reported data collection tools (3 papers), and wearable device intervention (10 papers). All the chosen studies are discussed based on the wearable device used, complementary data, study design, and data processing method. All these previous studies indicate that wearable devices are used either to validate their benefits for general wellbeing or for more serious medical contexts, such as cardiovascular disorders and post-stroke treatment. Despite their huge potential for adoption in clinical settings, wearable device accuracy and validity remain the key challenge to be met. Some lessons learned and future projections, such as combining traditional study design with statistical and machine learning methods, are highlighted in this paper to provide a useful overview for other researchers carrying out similar research.","Pardamean, Soeparno, Budiarto, Mahesworo, Baurley","https://doi.org/10.4258/hir.2020.26.2.83","20200928","Exercise; Fitness Tracker; Medical Informatics; Mental Health; Wearable Electronic Device","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16676,""
"Transitioning a Practice to Robotic Total Knee Arthroplasty Is Correlated with Favorable Short-Term Clinical Outcomes-A Single Surgeon Experience","Ã¢â‚¬Æ’This study sought to evaluate the patient experience and short-term clinical outcomes associated with the hospital stay of patients who underwent robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA). These results were compared with a cohort of patients who underwent TKA without robotic assistance performed by the same surgeon prior to the introduction of this technology. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’A cohort of consecutive patients undergoing primary TKA for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis by a single fellowship trained orthopaedic surgeon over a 39-month period was identified. Patients who underwent TKA during the year that this surgeon transitioned his entire knee arthroplasty practice to robotic assistance were excluded to eliminate selection bias and control for the learning curve. All patients received the same prosthesis and postoperative pain protocol. Patients that required intubation for failed spinal anesthetic were excluded. A final population of 492 TKAs was identified. Of these, 290 underwent TKA without robotic assistance and 202 underwent robotic arm-assisted TKA. Patient demographic characteristics and short-term clinical data were analyzed. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Robotic arm-assisted TKA was associated with shorter length of stay (2.3 vs. 2.6 days, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), a 50% reduction in morphine milligram equivalent utilization (from 214 to 103, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and a mean increase in procedure time of 9.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°minutes (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). There was one superficial infection in the nonrobotic cohort and there were no deep postoperative infections in either cohort. There were no manipulations under anesthesia in the robotic cohort while there were six in the nonrobotic cohort. Additionally, there were no significant differences in emergency department visits, readmissions, or return to the operating room. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’This analysis corroborates existing literature suggesting that robotic arm-assisted TKA can be correlated with improved short-term clinical outcomes. This study reports on a single surgeon's experience with regard to analgesic requirements, length of stay, pain scores, and procedure time following a complete transition to robotic arm-assisted TKA. These results underscore the importance of continued evaluation of clinical outcomes as robotic arthroplasty technology continues to grow.","King, Jordan, Bradley, Wlodarski, Tauchen, Puri","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1712984","20200616","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16677,""
"Neural substrates for late-life depression: A selective review of structural neuroimaging studies","Recent neuroimaging studies have characterized the pathophysiology of late-life depression (LLD) as a dysfunction of the brain networks involved in the regulation of emotion, motivational behavior, cognitive control, executive function, and self-referential thinking. In this article, we reviewed LLD-associated structural neuroimaging markers such as white matter hyperintensity (WMH), white matter integrity measured by diffusion tensor imaging, cortical and subcortical volumes, and cortical thickness, which may provide a structural basis for brain network dysfunction in LLD. LLD was associated with greater severity or volumes of deep, periventricular, or overall WMH and with decreased white matter integrity in the brain regions belonging to the fronto-striatal-limbic circuits and reduced white matter tract integrity which connects these circuits, such as the cingulum, corpus callosum, or uncinate fasciculus. Decreased volumes or cortical thickness in the prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, several temporal and parietal regions, hippocampus, amygdala, striatum, thalamus, and the insula were associated with LLD. These structural neuroimaging findings were also associated with cognitive dysfunction, which is a prominent clinical feature in LLD. Several structural neuroimaging markers including the WMH burden, white matter integrity, and cortical and subcortical volumes predicted antidepressant response in LLD. These structural neuroimaging findings support the hypothesis that disruption of the brain networks involved in emotion regulation and cognitive processing by impaired structural connectivity is strongly associated with the pathophysiology of LLD.","Kim, Han","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110010","20200909","Antidepressant; Geriatric depression; Late-life depression; Magnetic resonance imaging; Structural neuroimaging; White matter hyperintensity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16678,""
"Artificial intelligence and radiomics in pediatric molecular imaging","In the past decade, a new approach for quantitative analysis of medical images and prognostic modelling has emerged. Defined as the extraction and analysis of a large number of quantitative parameters from medical images, radiomics is an evolving field in precision medicine with the ultimate goal of the discovery of new imaging biomarkers for disease. Radiomics has already shown promising results in extracting diagnostic, prognostic, and molecular information latent in medical images. After acquisition of the medical images as part of the standard of care, a region of interest is defined often via a manual or semi-automatic approach. An algorithm then extracts and computes quantitative radiomics parameters from the region of interest. Whereas radiomics captures quantitative values of shape and texture based on predefined mathematical terms, neural networks have recently been used to directly learn and identify predictive features from medical images. Thereby, neural networks largely forego the need for so called &quot;hand-engineered&quot; features, which appears to result in significantly improved performance and reliability. Opportunities for radiomics and neural networks in pediatric nuclear medicine/radiology/molecular imaging are broad and can be thought of in three categories: automating well-defined administrative or clinical tasks, augmenting broader administrative or clinical tasks, and unlocking new methods of generating value. Specific applications include intelligent order sets, automated protocoling, improved image acquisition, computer aided triage and detection of abnormalities, next generation voice dictation systems, biomarker development, and therapy planning.","Wagner, Bilbily, Beheshti, Shammas, Vali","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2020.06.008","20200623","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Molecular imaging; Nuclear medicine; Pediatric radiology; Radiomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16679,""
"Relapse prevention in panic disorder with pharmacotherapy: where are we now?","<b>Introduction:</b> A substantial number of patients with PD experience relapse after the discontinuation of effective pharmacotherapy, leading to detrimental effects on the individuals and considerable societal costs. This suggests the need to optimize pharmacotherapy to minimize relapse risk. <b>Area covered:</b> The present systematic review examines randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled relapse prevention studies published over the last 20Ã‚Â years involving recommended medications. The authors aim to provide an overview of this topic and evaluate whether recent advances were achieved. Only seven studies were included, providing limited results. One-year maintenance pharmacotherapy with constant doses had protective effects against relapse in patients who had previously exhibited satisfactory responses to the same medication at the same doses. The duration of maintenance treatment did not influence relapse risk. No data were available concerning the use of lower doses or the predictors of relapse. <b>Expert opinion:</b> Relapse prevention in PD has received limited attention. Recent progress and conclusive indications are lacking. Rethinking pharmacological research in PD may be productive. Collecting a wide range of clinical and individual features/biomarkers in large-scale, multicenter long-term naturalistic studies, and implementing recent technological innovations (e.g., electronic medical records/'big data' platforms, wearable devices, and machine learning techniques) may help identify reliable predictive models.","Caldirola, Alciati, DaccÃƒÂ², Micieli, Perna","https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2020.1779220","20201016","Panic disorder; antidepressants; personalized medicine; pharmacotherapy; relapse; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; treatment outcome; tricyclic antidepressive agents; venlafaxine; Antidepressive Agents; Drug Administration Schedule; Humans; Panic Disorder; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Secondary Prevention; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors; Treatment Outcome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16680,""
"Use of a Machine Learning Program to Correctly Triage Incoming Text Messaging Replies From a Cardiovascular Text-Based Secondary Prevention Program: Feasibility Study","SMS text messaging programs are increasingly being used for secondary prevention, and have been shown to be effective in a number of health conditions including cardiovascular disease. SMS text messaging programs have the potential to increase the reach of an intervention, at a reduced cost, to larger numbers of people who may not access traditional programs. However, patients regularly reply to the SMS text messages, leading to additional staffing requirements to monitor and moderate the patients' SMS text messaging replies. This additional staff requirement directly impacts the cost-effectiveness and scalability of SMS text messaging interventions. This study aimed to test the feasibility and accuracy of developing a machine learning (ML) program to triage SMS text messaging replies (ie, identify which SMS text messaging replies require a health professional review). SMS text messaging replies received from 2 clinical trials were manually coded (1) into &quot;Is staff review required?&quot; (binary response of yes/no); and then (2) into 12 general categories. Five ML models (NaÃƒÂ¯ve Bayes, OneVsRest, Random Forest Decision Trees, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Multilayer Perceptron) and an ensemble model were tested. For each model run, data were randomly allocated into training set (2183/3118, 70.01%) and test set (935/3118, 29.98%). Accuracy for the yes/no classification was calculated using area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), false positives, and false negatives. Accuracy for classification into 12 categories was compared using multiclass classification evaluators. A manual review of 3118 SMS text messaging replies showed that 22.00% (686/3118) required staff review. For determining need for staff review, the Multilayer Perceptron model had highest accuracy (AUC 0.86; 4.85% false negatives; and 4.63% false positives); with addition of heuristics (specified keywords) fewer false negatives were identified (3.19%), with small increase in false positives (7.66%) and AUC 0.79. Application of this model would result in 26.7% of SMS text messaging replies requiring review (true + false positives). The ensemble model produced the lowest false negatives (1.43%) at the expense of higher false positives (16.19%). OneVsRest was the most accurate (72.3%) for the 12-category classification. The ML program has high sensitivity for identifying the SMS text messaging replies requiring staff input; however, future research is required to validate the models against larger data sets. Incorporation of an ML program to review SMS text messaging replies could significantly reduce staff workload, as staff would not have to review all incoming SMS text messages. This could lead to substantial improvements in cost-effectiveness, scalability, and capacity of SMS text messaging-based interventions.","Lowres, Duckworth, Redfern, Thiagalingam, Chow","https://doi.org/10.2196/19200","20201019","eHealth; machine learning, secondary prevention, SMS text messaging, cardiovascular, mHealth, digital health, mobile phone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16681,""
"Semantic text mining in early drug discovery for type 2 diabetes","Surveying the scientific literature is an important part of early drug discovery; and with the ever-increasing amount of biomedical publications it is imperative to focus on the most interesting articles. Here we present a project that highlights new understanding (e.g. recently discovered modes of action) and identifies potential drug targets, via a novel, data-driven text mining approach to score type 2 diabetes (T2D) relevance. We focused on monitoring trends and jumps in T2D relevance to help us be timely informed of important breakthroughs. We extracted over 7 million n-grams from PubMed abstracts and then clustered around 240,000 linked to T2D into almost 50,000 T2D relevant 'semantic concepts'. To score papers, we weighted the concepts based on co-mentioning with core T2D proteins. A protein's T2D relevance was determined by combining the scores of the papers mentioning it in the five preceding years. Each week all proteins were ranked according to their T2D relevance. Furthermore, the historical distribution of changes in rank from one week to the next was used to calculate the significance of a change in rank by T2D relevance for each protein. We show that T2D relevant papers, even those not mentioning T2D explicitly, were prioritised by relevant semantic concepts. Well known T2D proteins were therefore enriched among the top scoring proteins. Our 'high jumpers' identified important past developments in the apprehension of how certain key proteins relate to T2D, indicating that our method will make us aware of future breakthroughs. In summary, this project facilitated keeping up with current T2D research by repeatedly providing short lists of potential novel targets into our early drug discovery pipeline.","Hansson, Hansen, Pletscher-Frankild, Berzins, Hansen, Madsen, Christensen, Christiansen, Boulund, Wolf, KjÃƒÂ¦rulff, van de Bunt, Tulin, Jensen, Wernersson, Jensen","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233956","20200824","Algorithms; Data Mining; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Discovery; Humans; Proteins; Semantics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16682,""
"Patients' Utilization and Perception of an Artificial Intelligence-Based Symptom Assessment and Advice Technology in a British Primary Care Waiting Room: Exploratory Pilot Study","When someone needs to know whether and when to seek medical attention, there are a range of options to consider. Each will have consequences for the individual (primarily considering trust, convenience, usefulness, and opportunity costs) and for the wider health system (affecting clinical throughput, cost, and system efficiency). Digital symptom assessment technologies that leverage artificial intelligence may help patients navigate to the right type of care with the correct degree of urgency. However, a recent review highlighted a gap in the literature on the real-world usability of these technologies. We sought to explore the usability, acceptability, and utility of one such symptom assessment technology, Ada, in a primary care setting. Patients with a new complaint attending a primary care clinic in South London were invited to use a custom version of the Ada symptom assessment mobile app. This exploratory pilot study was conducted between November 2017 and January 2018 in a practice with 20,000 registered patients. Participants were asked to complete an Ada self-assessment about their presenting complaint on a study smartphone, with assistance provided if required. Perceptions on the app and its utility were collected through a self-completed study questionnaire following completion of the Ada self-assessment. Over a 3-month period, 523 patients participated. Most were female (n=325, 62.1%), mean age 39.79 years (SD 17.7 years), with a larger proportion (413/506, 81.6%) of working-age individuals (aged 15-64) than the general population (66.0%). Participants rated Ada's ease of use highly, with most (511/522, 97.8%) reporting it was very or quite easy. Most would use Ada again (443/503, 88.1%) and agreed they would recommend it to a friend or relative (444/520, 85.3%). We identified a number of age-related trends among respondents, with a directional trend for more young respondents to report Ada had provided helpful advice (50/54, 93%, 18-24-year olds reported helpful) than older respondents (19/32, 59%, adults aged 70+ reported helpful). We found no sex differences on any of the usability questions fielded. While most respondents reported that using the symptom checker would not have made a difference in their care-seeking behavior (425/494, 86.0%), a sizable minority (63/494, 12.8%) reported they would have used lower-intensity care such as self-care, pharmacy, or delaying their appointment. The proportion was higher for patients aged 18-24 (11/50, 22%) than aged 70+ (0/28, 0%). In this exploratory pilot study, the digital symptom checker was rated as highly usable and acceptable by patients in a primary care setting. Further research is needed to confirm whether the app might appropriately direct patients to timely care, and understand how this might save resources for the health system. More work is also needed to ensure the benefits accrue equally to older age groups.","Miller, Gilbert, Virani, Wicks","https://doi.org/10.2196/19713","20200928","acceptability; app; eHealth; general practice; health care apps; human-centered design; innovative; primary care; symptom checker; usability; utility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16683,""
"Decision analysis and reinforcement learning in surgical decision-making","Surgical patients incur preventable harm from cognitive and judgment errors made under time constraints and uncertainty regarding patients' diagnoses and predicted response to treatment. Decision analysis and techniques of reinforcement learning theoretically can mitigate these challenges but are poorly understood and rarely used clinically. This review seeks to promote an understanding of decision analysis and reinforcement learning by describing their use in the context of surgical decision-making. Cochrane, EMBASE, and PubMed databases were searched from their inception to June 2019. Included were 41 articles about cognitive and diagnostic errors, decision-making, decision analysis, and machine-learning. The articles were assimilated into relevant categories according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Requirements for time-consuming manual data entry and crude representations of individual patients and clinical context compromise many traditional decision-support tools. Decision analysis methods for calculating probability thresholds can inform population-based recommendations that jointly consider risks, benefits, costs, and patient values but lack precision for individual patient-centered decisions. Reinforcement learning, a machine-learning method that mimics human learning, can use a large set of patient-specific input data to identify actions yielding the greatest probability of achieving a goal. This methodology follows a sequence of events with uncertain conditions, offering potential advantages for personalized, patient-centered decision-making. Clinical application would require secure integration of multiple data sources and attention to ethical considerations regarding liability for errors and individual patient preferences. Traditional decision-support tools are ill-equipped to accommodate time constraints and uncertainty regarding diagnoses and the predicted response to treatment, both of which often impair surgical decision-making. Decision analysis and reinforcement learning have the potential to play complementary roles in delivering high-value surgical care through sound judgment and optimal decision-making.","Loftus, Filiberto, Li, Balch, Cook, Tighe, Efron, Upchurch, Rashidi, Li, Bihorac","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2020.04.049","20201031","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16684,""
"Artificial Intelligence-Based Multimodal Risk Assessment Model for Surgical Site Infection (AMRAMS): Development and Validation Study","Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common types of health care-associated infections. It increases mortality, prolongs hospital length of stay, and raises health care costs. Many institutions developed risk assessment models for SSI to help surgeons preoperatively identify high-risk patients and guide clinical intervention. However, most of these models had low accuracies. We aimed to provide a solution in the form of an Artificial intelligence-based Multimodal Risk Assessment Model for Surgical site infection (AMRAMS) for inpatients undergoing operations, using routinely collected clinical data. We internally and externally validated the discriminations of the models, which combined various machine learning and natural language processing techniques, and compared them with the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) risk index. We retrieved inpatient records between January 1, 2014, and June 30, 2019, from the electronic medical record (EMR) system of Rui Jin Hospital, Luwan Branch, Shanghai, China. We used data from before July 1, 2018, as the development set for internal validation and the remaining data as the test set for external validation. We included patient demographics, preoperative lab results, and free-text preoperative notes as our features. We used word-embedding techniques to encode text information, and we trained the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) model, random forest model, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model, convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and self-attention network model using the combined data. Surgeons manually scored the NNIS risk index values. For internal bootstrapping validation, CNN yielded the highest mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.889 (95% CI 0.886-0.892), and the paired-sample t test revealed statistically significant advantages as compared with other models (P&lt;.001). The self-attention network yielded the second-highest mean AUROC of 0.882 (95% CI 0.878-0.886), but the AUROC was only numerically higher than the AUROC of the third-best model, GBDT with text embeddings (mean AUROC 0.881, 95% CI 0.878-0.884, P=.47). The AUROCs of LASSO, random forest, and GBDT models using text embeddings were statistically higher than the AUROCs of models not using text embeddings (P&lt;.001). For external validation, the self-attention network yielded the highest AUROC of 0.879. CNN was the second-best model (AUROC 0.878), and GBDT with text embeddings was the third-best model (AUROC 0.872). The NNIS risk index scored by surgeons had an AUROC of 0.651. Our AMRAMS based on EMR data and deep learning methods-CNN and self-attention network-had significant advantages in terms of accuracy compared with other conventional machine learning methods and the NNIS risk index. Moreover, the semantic embeddings of preoperative notes improved the model performance further. Our models could replace the NNIS risk index to provide personalized guidance for the preoperative intervention of SSIs. Through this case, we offered an easy-to-implement solution for building multimodal RAMs for other similar scenarios.","Chen, Lu, You, Zhou, Xu, Chen","https://doi.org/10.2196/18186","20200928","artificial intelligence; deep learning; electronic medical record; machine learning; natural language processing; neural network; risk assessment model; routinely collected data; surgical site infection; word embedding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16685,""
"Detect Attributes of Medical Concepts via Sequence Labeling","In this study, we present a new method for detecting attributes of medical concepts, which uses a sequence labeling approach to recognize attribute entities and classify relations between concepts and attributes simultaneously within one step. A neural architecture combining bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks and Conditional Random fields (Bi-LSTMs-CRF) was adopted to detect disorder-modifier pairs in clinical text.

"Less-Lethal Weapons Resulting in Ophthalmic Injuries: A Review and Recent Example of Eye Trauma","Prior reports have highlighted the dangers of crowd control weapons such as rubber bullets, paintball guns, and pepper spray. Many of these reports were written decades ago and outside of the USA. We summarize a review of the literature and discuss a contemporary case of a ruptured globe and facial trauma secondary to a projectile weapon. This case serves to highlight the severity of eye trauma caused by less-lethal weapons; severe morbidity or even mortality can occur. A civilian presented after a projectile weapon reportedly fired by Denver law enforcement struck his face during one of the recent protests in May 2020 in Denver. Upon ophthalmic examination, we observed no light perception (NLP) vision, periorbital ecchymosis, and devastating globe trauma. Further examination revealed a severely ruptured globe with extensive hemorrhage and extrusion of intraocular contents. Attempts to repair the ruptured globe failed because of the lack of remaining scleral tissue and expulsion of intraocular contents. Postoperatively, the visual acuity remained NLP and the eye was unable to hold pressure. Subsequently, the patient elected for enucleation. Despite the purported safety advancements of less-lethal weapons, we continue to see high levels of morbidity and mortality. Permanent vision loss, loss of the eye, and death caused by these weapons have been reported. We hope that this information will serve as an example to help promote judicious use of these weapons by the proper authorities. Additionally, protesters and bystanders should be aware of these dangers and utilize high-quality eye protection.","Ifantides, Deitz, Christopher, Slingsby, Subramanian","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40123-020-00271-9","20200928","Eye trauma; Less lethal weapon; Ocular trauma; Paintball injury; Rubber bullet","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16688,""
"Development and external validation of a clinical prediction model for functional impairment after intracranial tumor surgery","Decision-making for intracranial tumor surgery requires balancing the oncological benefit against the risk for resection-related impairment. Risk estimates are commonly based on subjective experience and generalized numbers from the literature, but even experienced surgeons overestimate functional outcome after surgery. Today, there is no reliable and objective way to preoperatively predict an individual patient's risk of experiencing any functional impairment. The authors developed a prediction model for functional impairment at 3 to 6 months after microsurgical resection, defined as a decrease in Karnofsky Performance Status of Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10 points. Two prospective registries in Switzerland and Italy were used for development. External validation was performed in 7 cohorts from Sweden, Norway, Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands. Age, sex, prior surgery, tumor histology and maximum diameter, expected major brain vessel or cranial nerve manipulation, resection in eloquent areas and the posterior fossa, and surgical approach were recorded. Discrimination and calibration metrics were evaluated. In the development (2437 patients, 48.2% male; mean age Ã‚Â± SD: 55 Ã‚Â± 15 years) and external validation (2427 patients, 42.4% male; mean age Ã‚Â± SD: 58 Ã‚Â± 13 years) cohorts, functional impairment rates were 21.5% and 28.5%, respectively. In the development cohort, area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.72 (95% CI 0.69-0.74) were observed. In the pooled external validation cohort, the AUC was 0.72 (95% CI 0.69-0.74), confirming generalizability. Calibration plots indicated fair calibration in both cohorts. The tool has been incorporated into a web-based application available at https://neurosurgery.shinyapps.io/impairment/. Functional impairment after intracranial tumor surgery remains extraordinarily difficult to predict, although machine learning can help quantify risk. This externally validated prediction tool can serve as the basis for case-by-case discussions and risk-to-benefit estimation of surgical treatment in the individual patient.","Staartjes, Broggi, Zattra, Vasella, Velz, Schiavolin, Serra, Bartek, Fletcher-SandersjÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂ¶, FÃƒÂ¶rander, Kalasauskas, Renovanz, Ringel, Brawanski, Kerschbaumer, Freyschlag, Jakola, SjÃƒÂ¥vik, Solheim, Schatlo, Sachkova, Bock, Hussein, Rohde, Broekman, Nogarede, Lemmens, Kernbach, Neuloh, Bozinov, KrayenbÃƒÂ¼hl, Sarnthein, Ferroli, Regli, Stienen","https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.4.JNS20643","20200622","AUC = area under the curve; EOR = extent of resection; KPS = Karnofsky Performance Status; ML = machine learning; PROM = patient-reported outcome measure; functional impairment; machine learning; neurosurgery; oncology; outcome prediction; predictive analytics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16689,""
"Machine-learning-based diagnostics of EEG pathology","Machine learning (ML) methods have the potential to automate clinical EEG analysis. They can be categorized into feature-based (with handcrafted features), and end-to-end approaches (with learned features). Previous studies on EEG pathology decoding have typically analyzed a limited number of features, decoders, or both. For a I) more elaborate feature-based EEG analysis, and II) in-depth comparisons of both approaches, here we first develop a comprehensive feature-based framework, and then compare this framework to state-of-the-art end-to-end methods. To this aim, we apply the proposed feature-based framework and deep neural networks including an EEG-optimized temporal convolutional network (TCN) to the task of pathological versus non-pathological EEG classification. For a robust comparison, we chose the Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG Corpus (v2.0.0), which contains approximately 3000 EEG recordings. The results demonstrate that the proposed feature-based decoding framework can achieve accuracies on the same level as state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find accuracies across both approaches in an astonishingly narrow range from 81 to 86%. Moreover, visualizations and analyses indicated that both approaches used similar aspects of the data, e.g., delta and theta band power at temporal electrode locations. We argue that the accuracies of current binary EEG pathology decoders could saturate near 90% due to the imperfect inter-rater agreement of the clinical labels, and that such decoders are already clinically useful, such as in areas where clinical EEG experts are rare. We make the proposed feature-based framework available open source and thus offer a new tool for EEG machine learning research.","Gemein, Schirrmeister, ChrabÃ„â€¦szcz, Wilson, Boedecker, Schulze-Bonhage, Hutter, Ball","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117021","20201014","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diagnostics; EEG; Electroencephalography; Features; Machine learning; Pathology; Riemannian geometry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16690,""
"Deep learning in mental health outcome research: a scoping review","Mental illnesses, such as depression, are highly prevalent and have been shown to impact an individual's physical health. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been introduced to assist mental health providers, including psychiatrists and psychologists, for decision-making based on patients' historical data (e.g., medical records, behavioral data, social media usage, etc.). Deep learning (DL), as one of the most recent generation of AI technologies, has demonstrated superior performance in many real-world applications ranging from computer vision to healthcare. The goal of this study is to review existing research on applications of DL algorithms in mental health outcome research. Specifically, we first briefly overview the state-of-the-art DL techniques. Then we review the literature relevant to DL applications in mental health outcomes. According to the application scenarios, we categorize these relevant articles into four groups: diagnosis and prognosis based on clinical data, analysis of genetics and genomics data for understanding mental health conditions, vocal and visual expression data analysis for disease detection, and estimation of risk of mental illness using social media data. Finally, we discuss challenges in using DL algorithms to improve our understanding of mental health conditions and suggest several promising directions for their applications in improving mental health diagnosis and treatment.","Su, Xu, Pathak, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-0780-3","20200901","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16691,""
"Generating high-quality data abstractions from scanned clinical records: text-mining-assisted extraction of endometrial carcinoma pathology features as proof of principle","Medical research studies often rely on the manual collection of data from scanned typewritten clinical records, which can be laborious, time consuming and error prone because of the need to review individual clinical records. We aimed to use text mining to assist with the extraction of clinical features from complex text-based scanned pathology records for medical research studies. Text mining performance was measured by extracting and annotating three distinct pathological features from scanned photocopies of endometrial carcinoma clinical pathology reports, and comparing results to manually abstracted terms. Inclusion and exclusion keyword trigger terms to capture leiomyomas, endometriosis and adenomyosis were provided based on expert knowledge. Terms were expanded with character variations based on common optical character recognition (OCR) error patterns as well as negation phrases found in sample reports. The approach was evaluated on an unseen test set of 1293 scanned pathology reports originating from laboratories across Australia. Scanned typewritten pathology reports for women aged 18-79 years with newly diagnosed endometrial cancer (2005-2007) in Australia. High concordance with final abstracted codes was observed for identifying the presence of three pathology features (94%-98% F-measure). The approach was more consistent and reliable than manual abstractions, identifying 3%-14%Ã¢â‚¬â€°additional feature instances. Keyword trigger-based automation with OCR error correction and negation handling proved not only to be rapid and convenient, but also providing consistent and reliable data abstractions from scanned clinical records. In conjunction with manual review, it can assist in the generation of high-quality data abstractions for medical research studies.","Nguyen, O'Dwyer, Vu, Webb, Johnatty, Spurdle","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-037740","20200820","Keyword trigger-based automation with OCR error correction and negation handling proved not only to be rapid and convenient, but also providing consistent and reliable data abstractions from scanned clinical records.

"Mindfulness Ased Stress Reduction Interventions for Cancer Related Fatigue: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review","This meta-analysis aims to systematically evaluate the evidence for mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in cancer related fatigue (CRF). In October 2018, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials, China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and China Science Periodical Database (CSPD) were searched for randomized controlled trials on MBSR in CRF patients. Literature screening and data extraction were conducted by two reviewers. Methodological quality evaluation was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Revman 5.3.0 performs data analysis. The trial sequential analysis software estimated the required information size for each outcome indicator. There have been 5 studies included in this research for meta-analysis, 356 cases in the experimental group and 344 cases in the control group. The meta-analysis result indicates that: MBSR can reduce the cancer-related fatigue score of cancer patients, SMDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.51,95%CI [-0.81-0.20], PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001, and the difference is statistically significant. The trial sequential analysis indicates that: The RIS required for the indicator to reach the level of significance test should be 1768. The sample size (700 cases) included in the study has not reached the RIS, but it has crossed the traditional threshold and the TSA threshold, indicating that the results tend to be stable.

"A Review of Drug Side Effect Identification Methods","Drug side effects have become an important indicator for evaluating the safety of drugs. There are two main factors in the frequent occurrence of drug safety problems; on the one hand, the clinical understanding of drug side effects is insufficient, leading to frequent adverse drug reactions, while on the other hand, due to the long-term period and complexity of clinical trials, side effects of approved drugs on the market cannot be reported in a timely manner. Therefore, many researchers have focused on developing methods to identify drug side effects. In this review, we summarize the methods of identifying drug side effects and common databases in this field. We classified methods of identifying side effects into four categories: biological experimental, machine learning, text mining and network methods. We point out the key points of each kind of method.

"Prostate MRI radiomics: A systematic review and radiomic quality score assessment","Radiomics have the potential to further increase the value of MRI in prostate cancer management. However, implementation in clinical practice is still far and concerns have been raised regarding the methodological quality of radiomic studies. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review the literature to assess the quality of prostate MRI radiomic studies using the radiomics quality score (RQS). Multiple medical literature archives (PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE) were searched to retrieve original investigations focused on prostate MRI radiomic approaches up to the end of June 2019. Three researchers independently assessed each paper using the RQS. Data from the most experienced researcher were used for descriptive analysis. Inter-rater reproducibility was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) on the total RQS score. 73 studies were included in the analysis.

"A systematic literature review of forecasting and predictive models for cyanobacteria blooms in freshwater lakes","Cyanobacteria harmful blooms (CyanoHABs) in lakes and reservoirs represent a major risk for water authorities globally due to their toxicity and economic impacts. Anticipating bloom occurrence and understanding the main drivers of CyanoHABs are needed to optimize water resources management. An extensive review of the application of CyanoHABs forecasting and predictive models was performed, and a summary of the current state of knowledge, limitations and research opportunities on this topic is provided through analysis of case studies. Two modelling approaches were used to achieve CyanoHABs anticipation; process-based (PB) and data-driven (DD) models. The objective of the model was a determining factor for the choice of modelling approach. PB models were more frequently used to predict future scenarios whereas DD models were employed for short-term forecasts. Each modelling approach presented multiple variations that may be applied for more specific, targeted purposes. Most models reviewed were site-specific. The monitoring methodologies, including data frequency, uncertainty and precision, were identified as a major limitation to improve model performance. A lack of standardization of both model output and performance metrics was observed. CyanoHAB modelling is an interdisciplinary topic and communication between disciplines should be improved to facilitate model comparisons. These shortcomings can hinder the adoption of modelling tools by practitioners. We suggest that water managers should focus on generalising models for lakes with similar characteristics and where possible use high frequency monitoring for model development and validation.","Rousso, Bertone, Stewart, Hamilton","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.115959","20200908","Blooms; Blue-green algae; Cyanobacteria; Monitoring; Predictive modelling; Water resources management; Cyanobacteria; Eutrophication; Harmful Algal Bloom; Lakes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16696,""
"A systematic review of machine learning models for predicting outcomes of stroke with structured data","Machine learning (ML) has attracted much attention with the hope that it could make use of large, routinely collected datasets and deliver accurate personalised prognosis. The aim of this systematic review is to identify and critically appraise the reporting and developing of ML models for predicting outcomes after stroke. We searched PubMed and Web of Science from 1990 to March 2019, using previously published search filters for stroke, ML, and prediction models. We focused on structured clinical data, excluding image and text analysis. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019127154). Eighteen studies were eligible for inclusion. Most studies reported less than half of the terms in the reporting quality checklist. The most frequently predicted stroke outcomes were mortality (7 studies) and functional outcome (5 studies). The most commonly used ML methods were random forests (9 studies), support vector machines (8 studies), decision trees (6 studies), and neural networks (6 studies). The median sample size was 475 (range 70-3184), with a median of 22 predictors (range 4-152) considered. All studies evaluated discrimination with thirteen using area under the ROC curve whilst calibration was assessed in three. Two studies performed external validation. None described the final model sufficiently well to reproduce it. The use of ML for predicting stroke outcomes is increasing. However, few met basic reporting standards for clinical prediction tools and none made their models available in a way which could be used or evaluated. Major improvements in ML study conduct and reporting are needed before it can meaningfully be considered for practice.","Wang, Kiik, Peek, Curcin, Marshall, Rudd, Wang, Douiri, Wolfe, Bray","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234722","20200908","Humans; Machine Learning; Models, Statistical; Prognosis; Stroke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16697,""
"Detecting and Filtering Immune-Related Adverse Events Signal Based on Text Mining and Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics Common Data Model: Framework Development Study","Immune checkpoint inhibitors are associated with unique immune-related adverse events (irAEs). As most of the immune checkpoint inhibitors are new to the market, it is important to conduct studies using real-world data sources to investigate their safety profiles. The aim of the study was to develop a framework for signal detection and filtration of novel irAEs for 6 Food and Drug Administration-approved immune checkpoint inhibitors. In our framework, we first used the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) standardized in an Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) common data model (CDM) to collect immune checkpoint inhibitor-related event data and conducted irAE signal detection. OHDSI CDM is a standard-driven data model that focuses on transforming different databases into a common format and standardizing medical terms to a common representation. We then filtered those already known irAEs from drug labels and literature by using a customized text-mining pipeline based on clinical text analysis and knowledge extraction system with Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) as a dictionary. Finally, we classified the irAE detection results into three different categories to discover potentially new irAE signals. By our text-mining pipeline, 490 irAE terms were identified from drug labels, and 918 terms were identified from the literature. In addition, of the 94 positive signals detected using CDM-based FAERS, 53 signals (56%) were labeled signals, 10 (11%) were unlabeled published signals, and 31 (33%) were potentially new signals. We demonstrated that our approach is effective for irAE signal detection and filtration. Moreover, our CDM-based framework could facilitate adverse drug events detection and filtration toward the goal of next-generation pharmacovigilance that seamlessly integrates electronic health record data for improved signal detection.","Yu, Ruddy, Mansfield, Zong, Wen, Tsuji, Huang, Liu, Shah, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.2196/17353","20200928","adverse drug reaction reporting systems/standards; drug-related side effects and adverse reactions; immunotherapy/adverse effects; pharmacovigilance; text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16698,""
"The Effects of Cognitive Training on Brain Network Activity and Connectivity in Aging and Neurodegenerative Diseases: a Systematic Review","Cognitive training (CT) is an increasingly popular, non-pharmacological intervention for improving cognitive functioning in neurodegenerative diseases and healthy aging. Although meta-analyses support the efficacy of CT in improving cognitive functioning, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of CT are still unclear. We performed a systematic review of literature in the PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO databases on controlled CT trials (NÃ‚Â &gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°20) in aging and neurodegenerative diseases with pre- and post-training functional MRI outcomes up to November 23rd 2018 (PROSPERO registration number CRD42019103662). Twenty articles were eligible for our systematic review. We distinguished between multi-domain and single-domain CT. CT induced both increases and decreases in task-related functional activation, possibly indicative of an inverted U-shaped curve association between regional brain activity and task performance. Functional connectivity within 'cognitive' brain networks was consistently reported to increase after CT while a minority of studies additionally reported increased segregation of frontoparietal and default mode brain networks. Although we acknowledge the large heterogeneity in type of CT, imaging methodology, in-scanner task paradigm and analysis methods between studies, we propose a working model of the effects of CT on brain activity and connectivity in the context of current knowledge on compensatory mechanisms that are associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases.","van Balkom, van den Heuvel, Berendse, van der Werf, Vriend","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11065-020-09440-w","20200909","Aging; Cognitive training; Magnetic resonance imaging; Network; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neuroimaging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16699,""
"Which Learning Activities Enhance Physical Therapist Practice? Part 1: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Quantitative Studies","Following graduation from professional education, the development of clinical expertise requires career-long participation in learning activities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate which learning activities enhanced physical therapist practice. Eight databases were searched for studies published from inception through December 2018. Articles reporting quantitative data evaluating the effectiveness of learning activities completed by qualified physical therapists were included. Study characteristics and results were extracted from the 26 randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria. Clinician (knowledge, affective attributes, and behavior) and patient-related outcomes were extracted. There was limited evidence that professional development courses improved physical therapist knowledge. There was low-level evidence that peer assessment and feedback were more effective than case discussion at improving knowledge (standardized mean difference =Ã‚Â 0.35, 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.09-0.62). Results were inconsistent for the effect of learning activities on affective attributes. Courses with active learning components appeared more effective at changing physical therapist behavior. The completion of courses by physical therapists did not improve patient outcomes; however, the addition of a mentored patient interaction appeared impactful. Current evidence suggests active approaches, such as peer assessment and mentored patient interactions, should be used when designing learning activities for physical therapists. Further high-quality research focused on evaluating the impact of active learning interventions on physical therapist practice and patient outcomes is now needed. This study is a first step in determining which learning activities enhance clinical expertise and practice would enable the physical therapy profession to make informed decisions about the allocation of professional development resources.","Leahy, Chipchase, Calo, Blackstock","https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj/pzaa107","20200917","Clinical Competence; Education, Continuing; Humans; Learning; Physical Therapists; Physical Therapy Specialty; Treatment Outcome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16700,""
"Identifying main finding sentences in clinical case reports","Clinical case reports are the 'eyewitness reports' of medicine and provide a valuable, unique, albeit noisy and underutilized type of evidence. Generally, a case report has a single main finding that represents the reason for writing up the report in the first place. However, no one has previously created an automatic way of identifying main finding sentences in case reports. We previously created a manual corpus of main finding sentences extracted from the abstracts and full text of clinical case reports. Here, we have utilized the corpus to create a machine learning-based model that automatically predicts which sentence(s) from abstracts state the main finding. The model has been evaluated on a separate manual corpus of clinical case reports and found to have good performance. This is a step toward setting up a retrieval system in which, given one case report, one can find other case reports that report the same or very similar main findings.

"The Predictive Validity of Machine Learning Models in the Classification and Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder: State of the Art and Future Directions","Major depressive disorder imposes a substantial disease burden worldwide, ranking as the third leading contributor to global disability. In spite of its ubiquity, classifying and treating depression has proven troublesome. One argument put forward to explain this predicament is the heterogeneity of patients diagnosed with the disorder. Recently, many areas of daily life have witnessed the surge of machine learning techniques, computational approaches to elucidate complex patterns in large datasets, which can be employed to make predictions and detect relevant clusters. Due to the multidimensionality at play in the pathogenesis of depression, it is suggested that machine learning could contribute to improving classification and treatment. In this paper, we investigated literature focusing on the use of machine learning models on datasets with clinical variables of patients diagnosed with depression to predict treatment outcomes or find more homogeneous subgroups. Identified studies based on best practices in the field are evaluated. We found 16 studies predicting outcomes (such as remission) and identifying clusters in patients with depression. The identified studies are mostly still in proof-of-concept phase, with small datasets, lack of external validation, and providing single performance metrics. Larger datasets, and models with similar variables present across these datasets, are needed to develop accurate and generalizable models. We hypothesize that harnessing natural language processing to obtain data 'hidden' in clinical texts might prove useful in improving prediction models. Besides, researchers will need to focus on the conditions to feasibly implement these models to support psychiatrists and patients in their decision-making in practice. Only then we can enter the realm of precision psychiatry.","Ermers, Hagoort, Scheepers","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00472","20200928","electronic health records; machine learning; major depressive disorder; natural language processing; precision psychiatry; predictive modeling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16702,""
"Intelligent Telehealth System To Support Epilepsy Diagnosis","Availability and opportunity of epilepsy diagnostic services is a significant challenge, especially in developing countries with a low number of neurologists. The most commonly used test to diagnose epilepsy is Ã¯Â»Â¿electroencephalogram (EEG). A typical EEG recording lasts for 20 to 30 minutes; however, a specialist requires much more time to read it. Furthermore, no evidence was found in the literature on open-source systems for the cost-effective management of patient information using Ã¯Â»Â¿electronic Ã¯Â»Â¿health Ã¯Â»Â¿records (EHR) that adequately integrate EEG analysis for automatic identification of abnormal signals. To develop an integrated open-source EHR system for the management of the patients' personal, clinical, and EEG data, and for automatic identification of abnormal EEG signals. The core of the system is an EHR and telehealth service based on the OpenMRS platform. On top of that, we developed an intelligent component to automatically detect abnormal segments of EEG tests using Ã¯Â»Â¿machine Ã¯Â»Â¿learning algorithms, as well as a service to annotate and visualize abnormal segments in EEG signals. Finally, we evaluated the intelligent component and the integrated system using precision, recall, and accuracy metrics. The system allowed to manage patients' information properly, store and manage the EEG tests recorded with a medical EEG device, and to detect abnormal segments of signals with a precision of 85.10%, a recall of 97.16%, and an accuracy of 99.92%. Digital health is a multidisciplinary field of research in which artificial intelligence is playing a significant role in boosting traditional health services. Notably, the developed system could significantly reduce the time a neurologist spends in the reading of an EEG for the diagnosis of epilepsy, saving approximately 65-75% of the time consumed. It can be used in a telehealth environment. In this way, the availability and provision of diagnostic services for epilepsy management could be improved, especially in developing countries where the number of neurologists is low.","Molina, Sarmiento Torres, Salazar-Cabrera, LÃƒÂ³pez, Vargas-CaÃƒÂ±as","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S247878","20200928","EEG; EHR; diagnostic support system; machine learning; Ã¯Â»Â¿electroencephalogram; Ã¯Â»Â¿electronic Ã¯Â»Â¿health Ã¯Â»Â¿record","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16703,""
"The potential application of artificial intelligence for diagnosis and management of glaucoma in adults","Glaucoma is the most frequent cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. There is no cure, but early detection and treatment can slow the progression and prevent loss of vision. It has been suggested that artificial intelligence (AI) has potential application for detection and management of glaucoma. This literature review is based on articles published in peer-reviewed journals. There have been significant advances in both AI and imaging techniques that are able to identify the early signs of glaucomatous damage. Machine and deep learning algorithms show capabilities equivalent to human experts, if not superior. Concerns that the increased reliance on AI may lead to deskilling of clinicians. AI has potential to be used in virtual review clinics, telemedicine and as a training tool for junior doctors. Unsupervised AI techniques offer the potential of uncovering currently unrecognized patterns of disease. If this promise is fulfilled, AI may then be of use in challenging cases or where a second opinion is desirable. There is a need to determine the external validity of deep learning algorithms and to better understand how the 'black box' paradigm reaches results.","Campbell, Ting, Keane, Foster","https://doi.org/10.1093/bmb/ldaa012","20200903","artificial intelligence; deep learning; glaucoma; machine learning; machine learning classifiers; Ã¢â‚¬Ëœblack boxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ algorithm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16704,""
"The use of machine learning in rare diseases: a scoping review","Emerging machine learning technologies are beginning to transform medicine and healthcare and could also improve the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. Currently, there are no systematic reviews that investigate, from a general perspective, how machine learning is used in a rare disease context. This scoping review aims to address this gap and explores the use of machine learning in rare diseases, investigating, for example, in which rare diseases machine learning is applied, which types of algorithms and input data are used or which medical applications (e.g., diagnosis, prognosis or treatment) are studied. Using a complex search string including generic search terms and 381 individual disease names, studies from the past 10 years (2010-2019) that applied machine learning in a rare disease context were identified on PubMed. To systematically map the research activity, eligible studies were categorized along different dimensions (e.g., rare disease group, type of algorithm, input data), and the number of studies within these categories was analyzed. Two hundred eleven studies from 32 countries investigating 74 different rare diseases were identified. Diseases with a higher prevalence appeared more often in the studies than diseases with a lower prevalence. Moreover, some rare disease groups were investigated more frequently than to be expected (e.g., rare neurologic diseases and rare systemic or rheumatologic diseases), others less frequently (e.g., rare inborn errors of metabolism and rare skin diseases). Ensemble methods (36.0%), support vector machines (32.2%) and artificial neural networks (31.8%) were the algorithms most commonly applied in the studies. Only a small proportion of studies evaluated their algorithms on an external data set (11.8%) or against a human expert (2.4%). As input data, images (32.2%), demographic data (27.0%) and &quot;omics&quot; data (26.5%) were used most frequently. Most studies used machine learning for diagnosis (40.8%) or prognosis (38.4%) whereas studies aiming to improve treatment were relatively scarce (4.7%). Patient numbers in the studies were small, typically ranging from 20 to 99 (35.5%). Our review provides an overview of the use of machine learning in rare diseases. Mapping the current research activity, it can guide future work and help to facilitate the successful application of machine learning in rare diseases.","Schaefer, Lehne, Schepers, Prasser, Thun","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-020-01424-6","20200831","Machine learning; Rare diseases; Scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16705,""
"Artificial intelligence and automation of systematic reviews in women's health","Evidence-based women's healthcare is underpinned by systematic reviews and guidelines. Generating an evidence synthesis to support guidance for clinical practice is a time-consuming and labour-intensive activity that delays transfer of research into practice. Artificial intelligence has the potential to rapidly collate, combine, and update high-quality medical evidence with accuracy and precision, and without bias. This article describes the main fields of artificial intelligence with examples of its application to systematic reviews. These include the capabilities of processing natural language texts, retrieving information, reasoning, and learning. The complementarity and interconnection of the various artificial intelligence techniques can be harnessed to solve difficult problems in automation of reviews. Computer science can advance evidence-based medicine through development, testing, and refinement of artificial intelligence tools to deploy automation, creating 'living' evidence syntheses.

"Convolutional neural networks for brain tumour segmentation","The introduction of quantitative image analysis has given rise to fields such as radiomics which have been used to predict clinical sequelae. One growing area of interest for analysis is brain tumours, in particular glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Tumour segmentation is an important step in the pipeline in the analysis of this pathology. Manual segmentation is often inconsistent as it varies between observers. Automated segmentation has been proposed to combat this issue. Methodologies such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are machine learning pipelines modelled on the biological process of neurons (called nodes) and synapses (connections) have been of interest in the literature. We investigate the role of CNNs to segment brain tumours by firstly taking an educational look at CNNs and perform a literature search to determine an example pipeline for segmentation. We then investigate the future use of CNNs by exploring a novel field-radiomics. This examines quantitative features of brain tumours such as shape, texture, and signal intensity to predict clinical outcomes such as survival and response to therapy.","Bhandari, Koppen, Agzarian","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13244-020-00869-4","20200928","Artificial intelligence; Convolutional neural network; Glioblastoma; Segmentation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16707,""
"Shifting, overlapping and expanding use of &quot;precision oncology&quot; terminology: a retrospective literature analysis","The terms &quot;personalized oncology&quot; and &quot;precision oncology&quot; have increased in usage and have generated considerable traction in terms of public attention and research funding. To our knowledge, no prior study has as thoroughly documented the use of the &quot;precision oncology&quot; terminology over the last decade. To determine how the use of the terms &quot;personalized oncology&quot; and &quot;precision oncology&quot; have changed over time. A retrospective literature analysis using two databases (PubMed and Scopus) over 10 years was performed. Manuscripts using either term &quot;personalized oncology&quot; or &quot;precision oncology&quot; were collected. Manuscripts published in 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017 and through 30 June 2019 were pulled for text analysis. Common reasons for exclusion were if the search term appeared in the institution name only, the search term appeared only in keyword or publication title, or the search term was used to justify the relevance or application of research with no clear definition. Manuscripts published and catalogued in PubMed or Scopus. In our study, we analysed 399 unique manuscripts published over the last decade. Over time, the terminology has shifted from &quot;personalized oncology&quot; to &quot;precision oncology&quot;. Targeted therapy, molecular biomarker-guided tumour profiling and next generation sequencing (ie, &quot;omics-guided tumor profiling&quot;) are the three most common definitions of the term. While these definitions are somewhat overlapping in concept, over the decade we observed an increase in the number of distinct interpretations of &quot;precision oncology&quot;, ranging from structural biology to clinical practice. We have observed that the phrase &quot;precision oncology&quot; is shifting, overlapping and expanding in definition. This all-encompassing approach to defining &quot;precision oncology&quot; ironically renders the term imprecise.

"The association of dietary patterns and cardiorespiratory fitness: A systematic review","In comparison to the traditional risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, little is known about the interaction between diet and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). The present systematic review aimed to provide comprehensive evidence regarding the relationship between the dietary patterns (DPs) with CRF in both children and adults. Databases of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched from inception up to December 2019. All observational studies that had extracted DPs using a posteriori and/or a priori methods, as well as had assessed CRF as the outcome, were eligible for inclusion in the review. Eleven studies (1 longitudinal and 10 cross-sectional studies) comprising a total of 198,271 subjects were included. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies in terms of the extracted DPs, their food items as well as the statistical reporting outcomes; which all made comparisons between the studies difficult. Despite some inconsistent results, overall there was a positive association between the DPs that were highly loaded with fruits and vegetables, as well as closer adherence to the high-quality diets particularly the Mediterranean diet, with higher values of CRF. While, an inverse association was found for unhealthy DPs that were generally characterized by a high intake of refined grains, sweets, meats, processed foods, and high-fat dairy products. Overall, the evidence indicates the high-quality diets that are highlighted in the national dietary guidelines are associated with an optimal CRF.

An initial abstract and title screening was completed. Exclusion criteria included nonavailable abstract and full text, language, and nonrelevance. References of included studies and relevant review articles were cross-checked to identify additional studies. The database search identified 1374 articles. Abstract and title screening resulted in full-text retrieval of 96 articles. A total of N = 38 articles were retained. Applications of AI technologies involved the optimization of hearing aid technology (n = 5; 13% of all articles), speech enhancement technologies (n = 4; 11%), diagnosis and management of vestibular disorders (n = 11; 29%), prediction of sensorineural hearing loss outcomes (n = 9; 24%), interpretation of automatic brainstem responses (n = 5; 13%), and imaging modalities and image-processing techniques (n = 4; 10%).

"COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine design using reverse vaccinology and machine learning","To ultimately combat the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, it is desired to develop an effective and safe vaccine against this highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. We further used the Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool and the newly developed Vaxign-ML machine learning tool to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The N protein was found to be conserved in the more pathogenic strains (SARS/MERS/COVID-19), but not in the other human coronaviruses that mostly cause mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10) were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and linear B-cell epitopes localized in specific locations and functional domains of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets provide new strategies for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development.","Ong, Wong, Huffman, He","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.000141","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16711,""

Machine learning can contribute to better image quality by improving spatial resolution, reducing image noise, and removing undesired motion or other artifacts. As patients occasionally are unable to tolerate lengthy acquisition times or gadolinium agents, machine learning can potentially assist MRI workflow and patient comfort by facilitating faster acquisitions or reducing exogenous contrast dosage. Although artificial intelligence approaches often have limitations, such as problems with generalizability or explainability, there is potential for these techniques to improve diagnostic utility, throughput, and patient experience in clinical MRI practice.","Nguyen, Oztek, Nelakurti, Brunnquell, Mossa-Basha, Haynor, Prevedello","https://doi.org/10.1097/RMR.0000000000000249","20200810","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16712,""
"Intraoperative surgery room management: A deep learning perspective","The current study aimed to systematically review the literature addressing the use of deep learning (DL) methods in intraoperative surgery applications, focusing on the data collection, the objectives of these tools and, more technically, the DL-based paradigms utilized. A literature search with classic databases was performed: we identified, with the use of specific keywords, a total of 996 papers. Among them, we selected 52 for effective analysis, focusing on articles published after January 2015. The preliminary results of the implementation of DL in clinical setting are encouraging. Almost all the surgery sub-fields have seen the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the results outperformed the previous techniques in the majority of the cases. From these results, a conceptualization of an intelligent operating room (IOR) is also presented. This evaluation outlined how AI and, in particular, DL are revolutionizing the surgery field, with numerous applications, such as context detection and room management. This process is evolving years by years into the realization of an IOR, equipped with technologies perfectly suited to drastically improve the surgical workflow.","Tanzi, Piazzolla, Vezzetti","https://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.2136","20200630","deep learning; intraoperative; neural network; surgical workflow","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16713,""
"Prediction of therapeutic outcome and survival in a transgenic mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treated with dendritic cell vaccination or CDK inhibitor using MRI texture: a feasibility study","There is a lack of a well-established approach for assessment of early treatment outcomes for modern therapies for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) e.g. dinaciclib or dendritic cell (DC) vaccination. Here, we developed multivariate models using MRI texture features to detect treatment effects following dinaciclib drug or DC vaccine therapy in a transgenic mouse model of PDAC including 21 <i>LSL-Kras<sup>G12D</sup></i> ; <i>LSL-Trp53<sup>R172H</sup></i> ; <i>Pdx-1-Cre</i> (KPC) mice used as untreated control subjects (n=8) or treated with dinaciclib (n=7) or DC vaccine (n=6). Support vector machines (SVM) technique was performed to build a linear classifier with three variables for detection of tumor tissue changes following drug or vaccine treatments. Besides, multivariate regression models were generated with five variables to predict survival behavior and histopathological tumor markers (Fibrosis, CK19, and Ki67). The diagnostic performance was evaluated using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analyses. The regression models were evaluated with adjusted <i>r</i>-squared (<i>R<sub>adj</sub></i><sup>2</sup>). SVM classifier successfully distinguished changes in tumor tissue with an accuracy of 95.24% and AUC of 0.93. The multivariate models generated with five variables were strongly associated with histopathological tumor markers, fibrosis (<i>R<sub>adj</sub></i><sup>2</sup>=0.82, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), CK19 (<i>R<sub>adj</sub></i><sup>2</sup>=0.92, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) and Ki67 (<i>R<sub>adj</sub></i><sup>2</sup>=0.97, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Furthermore, the multivariate regression model successfully predicted survival of KPC mice by interpreting tumor characteristics from MRI data (<i>R<sub>adj</sub></i><sup>2</sup>=0.91, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). The results demonstrated that MRI texture features had great potential to generate diagnosis and prognosis models for monitoring early treatment response following dinaciclib drug or DC vaccine treatment and also predicting histopathological tumor markers and long-term clinical outcomes.","Eresen, Yang, Shangguan, Li, Hu, Sun, Yaghmai, Benson Iii, Zhang","https://www.google.com/search?q=Prediction+of+therapeutic+outcome+and+survival+in+a+transgenic+mouse+model+of+pancreatic+ductal+adenocarcinoma+treated+with+dendritic+cell+vaccination+or+CDK+inhibitor+using+MRI+texture:+a+feasibility+study.","20200928","Dendritic cell vaccine; dinaciclib; machine learning; magnetic resonance imaging; pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; texture analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16714,""
"Investigating exploration for deep reinforcement learning of concentric tube robot control","Concentric tube robots are composed of multiple concentric, pre-curved, super-elastic, telescopic tubes that are compliant and have a small diameter suitable for interventions that must be minimally invasive like fetal surgery. Combinations of rotation and extension of the tubes can alter the robot's shape but the inverse kinematics are complex to model due to the challenge of incorporating friction and other tube interactions or manufacturing imperfections. We propose a model-free reinforcement learning approach to form the inverse kinematics solution and directly obtain a control policy. Three exploration strategies are shown for deep deterministic policy gradient with hindsight experience replay for concentric tube robots in simulation environments. The aim is to overcome the joint to Cartesian sampling bias and be scalable with the number of robotic tubes. To compare strategies, evaluation of the trained policy network to selected Cartesian goals and associated errors are analyzed. The learned control policy is demonstrated with trajectory following tasks. Separation of extension and rotation joints for Gaussian exploration is required to overcome Cartesian sampling bias. Parameter noise and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck were found to be optimal strategies with less than 1 mm error in all simulation environments. Various trajectories can be followed with the optimal exploration strategy learned policy at high joint extension values. Our inverse kinematics solver in evaluation has 0.44Ã‚Â mm extension and [Formula: see text] rotation error. We demonstrate the feasibility of effective model-free control for concentric tube robots. Directly using the control policy, arbitrary trajectories can be followed and this is an important step towards overcoming the challenge of concentric tube robot control for clinical use in minimally invasive interventions.","Iyengar, Dwyer, Stoyanov","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02194-z","20200703","Concentric tube robots; Deep reinforcement learning; Robot control; Surgical robotics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16715,""
"Reconstructing the patient's natural history from electronic health records","The automatic extraction of a patient's natural history from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is a critical step towards building intelligent systems that can reason about clinical variables and support decision making. Although EHRs contain a large amount of valuable information about the patient's medical care, this information can only be fully understood when analyzed in a temporal context. Any intelligent system should then be able to extract medical concepts, date expressions, temporal relations and the temporal ordering of medical events from the free texts of EHRs; yet, this task is hard to tackle, due to the domain specific nature of EHRs, writing quality and lack of structure of these texts, and more generally the presence of redundant information. In this paper, we introduce a new Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework, capable of extracting the aforementioned elements from EHRs written in Spanish using rule-based methods. We focus on building medical timelines, which include disease diagnosis and its progression over time. By using a large dataset of EHRs comprising information about patients suffering from lung cancer, we show that our framework has an adequate level of performance by correctly building the timeline for 843 patients from a pool of 989 patients, achieving a precision of 0.852.","Najafabadipour, Zanin, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Torrente, NuÃƒÂ±ez GarcÃƒÂ­a, Cruz Bermudez, Provencio, Menasalvas","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101860","20200818","Electronic Health Records; Natural Language Processing; Temporal Reasoning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16716,""
"Performance of deep neural network-based artificial intelligence method in diabetic retinopathy screening: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy","Automatic diabetic retinopathy screening system based on neural networks has been used to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, there is no quantitative synthesis of performance of these methods. We aimed to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of neural networks in DR grading. Medline, Embase, IEEE Xplore, and Cochrane Library were searched up to 23 July 2019. Studies that evaluated performance of neural networks in detection of moderate or worse DR or diabetic macular edema using retinal fundus images with ophthalmologists' judgment as reference standard were included. Two reviewers extracted data independently. Risk of bias of eligible studies was assessed using QUDAS-2 tool. Twenty-four studies involving 235 235 subjects were included. Quantitative random-effects meta-analysis using the Rutter and Gatsonis hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (HSROC) model revealed a pooled sensitivity of 91.9% (95% CI: 89.6% to 94.3%) and specificity of 91.3% (95% CI: 89.0% to 93.5%). Subgroup analyses and meta-regression did not provide any statistically significant findings for the heterogeneous diagnostic accuracy in studies with different image resolutions, sample sizes of training sets, architecture of convolutional neural networks, or diagnostic criteria. State-of-the-art neural networks could effectively detect clinical significant DR. To further improve diagnostic accuracy of neural networks, researchers might need to develop new algorithms rather than simply enlarge sample sizes of training sets or optimize image quality.","Wang, Zhang, Lei, Zhu, Li, Wang, Yang, Chen, Pan","https://doi.org/10.1530/EJE-19-0968","20200616","Artificial Intelligence; Diabetic Retinopathy; Fundus Oculi; Humans; Macular Edema; Mass Screening; Neural Networks, Computer; Sensitivity and Specificity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16717,""
"360-degree Delphi: addressing sociotechnical challenges of healthcare IT","IT systems in the healthcare field can have a marked sociotechnical impact: they modify communication habits, alter clinical processes and may have serious ethical implications. The introduction of such systems involves very different groups of stakeholders because of the inherent multi-professionalism in medicine and the role of patients and their relatives that are often underrepresented. Each group contributes distinct perspectives and particular needs, which create specific requirements for IT systems and may strongly influence their acceptance and success. In the past, needs analysis, challenges and requirements for medical IT systems have often been addressed using consensus techniques such as the Delphi technique. Facing the heterogeneous spectrum of stakeholders there is a need to develop these techniques further to control the (strong) influence of the composition of the expert panel on the outcome and to deal systematically with potentially incompatible needs of stakeholder groups. This approach uses the strong advantages a Delphi study has, identifies the disadvantages of traditional Delphi techniques and aims to introduce and evaluate a modified approach called 360-Degree Delphi. Key aspects of 360-Degree Delphi are tested by applying the approach to the needs and requirements analysis of a system for managing patients' advance directives and living wills. 360-Degree Delphi (short 360Ã‚Â°D), as a modified Delphi process, is specified as a structured workflow with the optional use of stakeholder groups. The approach redefines the composition of the expert panel by setting up groups of different stakeholders. Consensus is created within individual stakeholder groups, but is also communicated between groups, while the iterative structure of the Delphi process remains unchanged. We hypothesize that (1) 360-Degree Delphi yields complementary statements from different stakeholders, which would be lost in classical Delphi; while (2) the variation of statements within individual stakeholder groups is lower than within the total collective. A user study is performed that addresses five stakeholder groups (patients, relatives, medical doctors, nurses and software developers) on the topic of living will communication in an emergency context. Qualitative open questions are used in a Delphi round 0. Answer texts are coded by independent raters who carry out systematic bottom-up qualitative text analysis. Inter-rater reliability is calculated and the resulting codes are used to test the hypotheses. Qualitative results are transferred into quantitative questions and then surveyed in round 1. The study took place in Germany. About 25% of the invited experts (stakeholders) agreed to take part in the Delphi round 0 (three patients, two relatives, three medical doctors, two qualified nurses and three developers), forming a structured panel of the five stakeholder groups. Two raters created a bottom-up coding, and 238 thematic codes were identified by the qualitative text analysis. The inter-rater reliability showed that 44.95% of the codes were semantically similar and coded for the same parts of the raw textual replies. Based on a consented coding list, a quantitative online-questionnaire was developed and send to different stakeholder groups. With respect to the hypotheses, Delphi round 0 had the following results: (1) doctors had a completely different focus from all the other stakeholder groups on possible channels of communications with the patient; (2) the dispersion of codes within individual stakeholder groups and within the total collective - visualized by box plots - was approximately 28% higher in the total collective than in the sub-collectives, but without a marked effect size. With respect to the hypotheses, Delphi round 1 had the following results: different stakeholder groups had highly diverging opinions with respect to central questions on IT-development. For example, when asked to rate the importance of access control against high availability of data (likert scale, 1 meaning restrictive data access, 6 easy access to all data), patients (mean 4.862, Stdev +/-Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.866) and caregivers (mean 5.667, Stdev: +/-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.816) highly favored data availability, while relatives would restrict data access (mean 2.778, stdev +/-Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.093). In comparison, the total group would not be representative of either of these individual stakeholder needs (mean 4.344, stdev +/-Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.870). 360-Degree Delphi is feasible and allows different stakeholder groups within an expert panel to reach agreement individually. Thus, it generates a more detailed consensus which pays more tribute to individual stakeholders needs. This has the potential to improve the time to consensus as well as to produce a more representative and precise needs and requirements analysis. However, the method may create new challenges for the IT development process, which will have to deal with complementary or even contradictory statements from different stakeholder groups.","WaldmÃƒÂ¼ller, Spreckelsen, Rudat, Krumm, Rolke, Jonas","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-1071-x","20200807","360-degree Delphi; Consensus; Delphi technique; Feedback; Group processes; Health information management; Medical informatics; Project planning; Qualitative research; Quality improvement; Stakeholder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16718,""
"Can network pharmacology identify the anti-virus and anti- inflammatory activities of Shuanghuanglian oral liquid used in Chinese medicine for respiratory tract infection?","Shuanghuanglian (SHL) oral liquid is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine preparation administered for respiratory tract infections in China. However, the underlying pharmacological mechanisms remain unclear. The present study aims to determine the potential pharmacological mechanisms of SHL oral liquid based on network pharmacology. Network pharmacology-based strategy including collection and analysis of putative compounds and target genes, network construction, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, identification of key compounds and target genes, and molecule docking was performed in this study. A total of 82 bioactive compounds and 226 putative target genes of SHL oral liquid were collected. Of note, 28 hub target genes including 4 major hub target genes: estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), nuclear receptor coactivator 2 (NCOA2), nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (NCOA1), androgen receptor (AR) and 5 key compounds (quercetin, luteolin, baicalein, kaempferol and wogonin) were identified based on network analysis. The hub target genes mainly enriched in pathways including PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, human cytomegalovirus infection, and human papillomavirus infection, which could be the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of SHL oral liquid for treating diseases. Moreover, the key compounds had great molecule docking binding affinity with the major hub target genes. Using network pharmacology analysis, SHL oral liquid was found to contain anti-virus, anti-inflammatory, and &quot;multi-compounds and multi-targets&quot; with therapeutic actions. These findings may provide a valuable direction for further clinical application and research.","Zhuang, Wen, Zhang, Zhang, Zhong, Chen, Luo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101139","20200928","AM, alveolar macrophages; AR, androgen receptor; CAS, Chemical abstracts service number; CFDA, The China Food and Drug Administration; COX, cyclooxygenases; COX-2, cyclooxygenase; DL, drug-likeness; ESR1, estrogen receptor 1; Flos Lonicerae; Fructus Forsythiae; GO, Gene Ontology; HCMV, Human cytomegalovirus; HCV, human cytomegalovirus; HPV, Human papillomavirus; HQ, Huangqin, Radix Scutellariae; JYH, Jinyinhua, Flos Lonicerae; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; LQ, Lianqiao, Fructus Forsythiae; MCP, monocyte chemoattractant protein; NCOA1, nuclear receptor coactivator 1; NCOA2, nuclear receptor coactivator 2; NO, nitric oxide; Network pharmacology; OB, oral bioavailability; PG, prostaglandin; Pharmacological mechanism; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; Radix Scutellariae; Respiratory tract infection; SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SHL oral liquid, Shuanghuanglian oral liquid; SMILES, Simplified molecular input line entry specification; Shuanghuanglian oral liquid; TCM, traditional Chinese medicine; TCMSP, Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16719,""
"Development of an Online Health Care Assessment for Preventive Medicine: A Machine Learning Approach","In the era of information explosion, the use of the internet to assist with clinical practice and diagnosis has become a cutting-edge area of research. The application of medical informatics allows patients to be aware of their clinical conditions, which may contribute toward the prevention of several chronic diseases and disorders. In this study, we applied machine learning techniques to construct a medical database system from electronic medical records (EMRs) of subjects who have undergone health examination. This system aims to provide online self-health evaluation to clinicians and patients worldwide, enabling personalized health and preventive health. We built a medical database system based on the literature, and data preprocessing and cleaning were performed for the database. We utilized both supervised and unsupervised machine learning technology to analyze the EMR data to establish prediction models. The models with EMR databases were then applied to the internet platform. The validation data were used to validate the online diagnosis prediction system. The accuracy of the prediction model for metabolic syndrome reached 91%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.904 in this system. For chronic kidney disease, the prediction accuracy of the model reached 94.7%, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.982. In addition, the system also provided disease diagnosis visualization via clustering, allowing users to check their outcome compared with those in the medical database, enabling increased awareness for a healthier lifestyle. Our web-based health care machine learning system allowed users to access online diagnosis predictions and provided a health examination report. Users could understand and review their health status accordingly. In the future, we aim to connect hospitals worldwide with our platform, so that health care practitioners can make diagnoses or provide patient education to remote patients. This platform can increase the value of preventive medicine and telemedicine.","Yu, Lin, Lin, Lin, Wu, Chang","https://doi.org/10.2196/18585","20201020","machine learning; medical informatics; online healthcare assessment; preventive medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16720,""
"Ethical Considerations of Using Machine Learning for Decision Support in Occupational Health: An Example Involving Periodic Workers' Health Assessments","Purpose Computer algorithms and Machine Learning (ML) will be integrated into clinical decision support within occupational health care. This will change the interaction between health care professionals and their clients, with unknown consequences. The aim of this study was to explore ethical considerations and potential consequences of using ML based decision support tools (DSTs) in the context of occupational health. Methods We conducted an ethical deliberation. This was supported by a narrative literature review of publications about ML and DSTs in occupational health and by an assessment of the potential impact of ML-DSTs according to frameworks from medical ethics and philosophy of technology. We introduce a hypothetical clinical scenario from a workers' health assessment to reflect on biomedical ethical principles: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice. Results Respect for autonomy is affected by uncertainty about what future consequences the worker is consenting to as a result of the fluctuating nature of ML-DSTs and validity evidence used to inform the worker. A beneficent advisory process is influenced because the three elements of evidence based practice are affected through use of a ML-DST. The principle of non-maleficence is challenged by the balance between group-level benefits and individual harm, the vulnerability of the worker in the occupational context, and the possibility of function creep. Justice might be empowered when the ML-DST is valid, but profiling and discrimination are potential risks. Conclusions Implications of ethical considerations have been described for the socially responsible design of ML-DSTs. Three recommendations were provided to minimize undesirable adverse effects of the development and implementation of ML-DSTs.","Six Dijkstra, Siebrand, Dorrestijn, Salomons, Reneman, Oosterveld, Soer, Gross, Bieleman","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-020-09895-x","20200814","Clinical decision support system; Ethics; Evidence based practice; Machine learning; Morals; Occupational health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16721,""
"FCGCNMDA: predicting miRNA-disease associations by applying fully connected graph convolutional networks","Growing evidence indicates that the development and progression of multiple complex diseases are influenced by microRNA (miRNA). Identifying more miRNAs as biomarkers for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis is vital to promote the development of bioinformatics and medicine. Considering that the traditional biological experimental methods are generally time-consuming and expensive, high-efficient computational methods are encouraged to uncover potential disease-related miRNAs. In this paper, FCGCNMDA is presented to predict latent miRNA-disease associations by utilizing fully connected graph convolutional networks. Specially, our method first constructs a fully connected graph in which edge weights represent correlation coefficient between any two pairs of miRNA-disease pair, and then feeds this fully connected graph along with miRNA-disease pairs feature matrix into a two-layer graph convolutional networks (GCN) for training. At last, we utilize the trained network to predict the scores for unknown miRNA-disease pairs. As a result, FCGCNMDA achieves AUC value of [Formula: see text] and AUPRC value of [Formula: see text] in HMDD v2.0 based on five-fold cross validation. Moreover, case studies on Lymphoma, Breast Neoplasms and Prostate Neoplasms shown that 98%, 98%, 98% of the top 50 selected miRNAs were validated by recent experimental evidence. From above results, we can deduce that FCGCNMDA can be regarded as reliable method for potential miRNA-disease associations prediction.","Li, Li, Nie, You, Bao","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00438-020-01693-7","20200806","Deep learning; Fully connected graph; Graph convolutional networks; miRNA-disease association; Algorithms; Area Under Curve; Breast Neoplasms; Computational Biology; Deep Learning; Early Diagnosis; Female; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Markers; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Lymphoma; Male; MicroRNAs; Prognosis; Prostatic Neoplasms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16722,""
"Automatic Assessment of Speech Impairment in Cantonese-speaking People with Aphasia","Aphasia is a common type of acquired language impairment resulting from dysfunction in specific brain regions. Analysis of narrative spontaneous speech, e.g., story-telling, is an essential component of standardized clinical assessment on people with aphasia (PWA). Subjective assessment by trained speech-language pathologists (SLP) have many limitations in efficiency, effectiveness and practicality. This paper describes a fully automated system for speech assessment of Cantonese-speaking PWA. A deep neural network (DNN) based automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is developed for aphasic speech by multi-task training with both in-domain and out-of-domain speech data. Story-level embedding and Siamese network are applied to derive robust text features, which can be used to quantify the difference between aphasic speech and unimpaired one. The proposed text features are combined with conventional acoustic features to cover different aspects of speech and language impairment in PWA. Experimental results show a high correlation between predicted scores and subject assessment scores. The best correlation value achieved with ASR-generated transcription is .827, as compared with .844 achieved with manual transcription. The Siamese network significantly outperforms story-level embedding in generating text features for automatic assessment.","Qin, Lee, Kong","https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2019.2956371","20200928","Cantonese; Pathological speech assessment; aphasia; automatic speech recognition; deep neural network","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16723,""
"Brain Network Disruption in Whiplash","Whiplash-associated disorders frequently develop following motor vehicle collisions and often involve a range of cognitive and affective symptoms, though the neural correlates of the disorder are largely unknown. In this study, a sample of participants with chronic whiplash injuries were scanned by using resting-state fMRI to assess brain network changes associated with long-term outcome metrics. Resting-state fMRI was collected for 23 participants and used to calculate network modularity, a quantitative measure of the functional segregation of brain region communities. This was analyzed for associations with whiplash-associated disorder outcome metrics, including scales of neck disability, traumatic distress, depression, and pain. In addition to these clinical scales, cervical muscle fat infiltration was quantified by using Dixon fat-water imaging, which has shown promise as a biomarker for assessing disorder severity and predicting recovery in chronic whiplash. An association was found between brain network structure and muscle fat infiltration, wherein lower network modularity was associated with larger amounts of cervical muscle fat infiltration after controlling for age, sex, body mass index, and scan motion (<i>t</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=<i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°</i>-4.02, partial <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°</i>=<i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°</i>0.49, <i>PÃ¢â‚¬â€°</i>&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). This work contributes to the existing whiplash literature by examining a sample of participants with whiplash-associated disorder by using resting-state fMRI. Less modular brain networks were found to be associated with greater amounts of cervical muscle fat infiltration suggesting a connection between disorder severity and neurologic changes, and a potential role for neuroimaging in understanding the pathophysiology of chronic whiplash-associated disorders.","Higgins, Elliott, Parrish","https://doi.org/10.3174/ajnr.A6569","20200813","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16724,""
"Automated machine learning: Review of the state-of-the-art and opportunities for healthcare","This work aims to provide a review of the existing literature in the field of automated machine learning (AutoML) to help healthcare professionals better utilize machine learning models &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; with limited data science expertise. We also identify the potential opportunities and barriers to using AutoML in healthcare, as well as existing applications of AutoML in healthcare. Published papers, accompanied with code, describing work in the field of AutoML from both a computer science perspective or a biomedical informatics perspective were reviewed. We also provide a short summary of a series of AutoML challenges hosted by ChaLearn. A review of 101 papers in the field of AutoML revealed that these automated techniques can match or improve upon expert human performance in certain machine learning tasks, often in a shorter amount of time. The main limitation of AutoML at this point is the ability to get these systems to work efficiently on a large scale, i.e. beyond small- and medium-size retrospective datasets. The utilization of machine learning techniques has the demonstrated potential to improve health outcomes, cut healthcare costs, and advance clinical research. However, most hospitals are not currently deploying machine learning solutions. One reason for this is that health care professionals often lack the machine learning expertise that is necessary to build a successful model, deploy it in production, and integrate it with the clinical workflow. In order to make machine learning techniques easier to apply and to reduce the demand for human experts, automated machine learning (AutoML) has emerged as a growing field that seeks to automatically select, compose, and parametrize machine learning models, so as to achieve optimal performance on a given task and/or dataset. While there have already been some use cases of AutoML in the healthcare field, more work needs to be done in order for there to be widespread adoption of AutoML in healthcare.","Waring, Lindvall, Umeton","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101822","20200818","AutoML; Automated machine learning; Deep learning; Healthcare; Machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16725,""
"Early detection of sepsis utilizing deep learning on electronic health record event sequences","The timeliness of detection of a sepsis incidence in progress is a crucial factor in the outcome for the patient. Machine learning models built from data in electronic health records can be used as an effective tool for improving this timeliness, but so far, the potential for clinical implementations has been largely limited to studies in intensive care units. This study will employ a richer data set that will expand the applicability of these models beyond intensive care units. Furthermore, we will circumvent several important limitations that have been found in the literature: (1) Model evaluations neglect the clinical consequences of a decision to start, or not start, an intervention for sepsis. (2) Models are evaluated shortly before sepsis onset without considering interventions already initiated. (3) Machine learning models are built on a restricted set of clinical parameters, which are not necessarily measured in all departments. (4) Model performance is limited by current knowledge of sepsis, as feature interactions and time dependencies are hard-coded into the model. In this study, we present a model to overcome these shortcomings using a deep learning approach on a diverse multicenter data set. We used retrospective data from multiple Danish hospitals over a seven-year period. Our sepsis detection system is constructed as a combination of a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network. We assess model quality by standard concepts of accuracy as well as clinical usefulness, and we suggest a retrospective assessment of interventions by looking at intravenous antibiotics and blood cultures preceding the prediction time. Results show performance ranging from AUROC 0.856 (3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯h before sepsis onset) to AUROC 0.756 (24Ã¢â‚¬Â¯h before sepsis onset). Evaluating the clinical utility of the model, we find that a large proportion of septic patients did not receive antibiotic treatment or blood culture at the time of the sepsis prediction, and the model could, therefore, facilitate such interventions at an earlier point in time. We present a deep learning system for early detection of sepsis that can learn characteristics of the key factors and interactions from the raw event sequence data itself, without relying on a labor-intensive feature extraction work. Our system outperforms baseline models, such as gradient boosting, which rely on specific data elements and therefore suffer from many missing values in our dataset.","Lauritsen, KalÃƒÂ¸r, Kongsgaard, Lauritsen, JÃƒÂ¸rgensen, Lange, Thiesson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101820","20200818","Clinical decision support systems; Early diagnosis; Electronic health records; Machine learning; Medical informatics; Sepsis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16726,""
"Computerized decision support and machine learning applications for the prevention and treatment of childhood obesity: A systematic review of the literature","Digital health interventions based on tools for Computerized Decision Support (CDS) and Machine Learning (ML), which take advantage of new information, sensing and communication technologies, can play a key role in childhood obesity prevention and treatment. We present a systematic literature review of CDS and ML applications for the prevention and treatment of childhood obesity. The main characteristics and outcomes of studies using CDS and ML are demonstrated, to advance our understanding towards the development of smart and effective interventions for childhood obesity care. A search in the bibliographic databases of PubMed and Scopus was performed to identify childhood obesity studies incorporating either CDS interventions, or advanced data analytics through ML algorithms. Ongoing, case, and qualitative studies, along with those not providing specific quantitative outcomes were excluded. The studies incorporating CDS were synthesized according to the intervention's main technology (e.g., mobile app), design type (e.g., randomized controlled trial), number of enrolled participants, target age of children, participants' follow-up duration, primary outcome (e.g., Body Mass Index (BMI)), and main CDS feature(s) and their outcomes (e.g., alerts for caregivers when BMI is high). The studies incorporating ML were synthesized according to the number of subjects included and their age, the ML algorithm(s) used (e.g., logistic regression), as well as their main outcome (e.g., prediction of obesity). The literature search identified 8 studies incorporating CDS interventions and 9 studies utilizing ML algorithms, which met our eligibility criteria. All studies reported statistically significant interventional or ML model outcomes (e.g., in terms of accuracy). More than half of the interventional studies (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5, 63 %) were designed as randomized controlled trials. Half of the interventional studies (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4, 50 %) utilized Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and alerts for BMI as means of CDS. From the 9 studies using ML, the highest percentage targeted at the prognosis of obesity (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4, 44 %). In the studies incorporating more than one ML algorithms and reporting accuracy, it was shown that decision trees and artificial neural networks can accurately predict childhood obesity. This review has found that CDS tools can be useful for the self-management or remote medical management of childhood obesity, whereas ML algorithms such as decision trees and artificial neural networks can be helpful for prediction purposes. Further rigorous studies in the area of CDS and ML for childhood obesity care are needed, considering the low number of studies identified in this review, their methodological limitations, and the scarcity of interventional studies incorporating ML algorithms in CDS tools.","Triantafyllidis, Polychronidou, Alexiadis, Rocha, Oliveira, da Silva, Freire, Macedo, Sousa, Werbet, Lillo, Luengo, EllacurÃƒÂ­a, Votis, Tzovaras","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101844","20200818","Childhood obesity; Computerized decision support; Digital health; Machine learning; Review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16727,""
"Digital tools for the recruitment and retention of participants in randomised controlled trials: a systematic map","Recruiting and retaining participants in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is challenging. Digital tools, such as social media, data mining, email or text-messaging, could improve recruitment or retention, but an overview of this research area is lacking. We aimed to systematically map the characteristics of digital recruitment and retention tools for RCTs, and the features of the comparative studies that have evaluated the effectiveness of these tools during the past 10 years. We searched Medline, Embase, other databases, the Internet, and relevant web sites in July 2018 to identify comparative studies of digital tools for recruiting and/or retaining participants in health RCTs. Two reviewers independently screened references against protocol-specified eligibility criteria. Included studies were coded by one reviewer with 20% checked by a second reviewer, using pre-defined keywords to describe characteristics of the studies, populations and digital tools evaluated. We identified 9163 potentially relevant references, of which 104 articles reporting 105 comparative studies were included in the systematic map. The number of published studies on digital tools has doubled in the past decade, but most studies evaluated digital tools for recruitment rather than retention. The key health areas investigated were health promotion, cancers, circulatory system diseases and mental health. Few studies focussed on minority or under-served populations, and most studies were observational. The most frequently-studied digital tools were social media, Internet sites, email and tv/radio for recruitment; and email and text-messaging for retention. One quarter of the studies measured efficiency (cost per recruited or retained participant) but few studies have evaluated people's attitudes towards the use of digital tools. This systematic map highlights a number of evidence gaps and may help stakeholders to identify and prioritise further research needs. In particular, there is a need for rigorous research on the efficiency of the digital tools and their impact on RCT participants and investigators, perhaps as studies-within-a-trial (SWAT) research. There is also a need for research into how digital tools may improve participant retention in RCTs which is currently underrepresented relative to recruitment research.

"Automated MRI-Based Deep Learning Model for Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Process","In the context of neuro-pathological disorders, neuroimaging has been widely accepted as a clinical tool for diagnosing patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The advanced deep learning method, a novel brain imaging technique, was applied in this study to evaluate its contribution to improving the diagnostic accuracy of AD. Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) were applied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to execute binary and ternary disease classification models. The dataset from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) was used to compare the deep learning performances across 3D-CNN, 3D-CNN-support vector machine (SVM) and two-dimensional (2D)-CNN models. The outcomes of accuracy with ternary classification for 2D-CNN, 3D-CNN and 3D-CNN-SVM were [Formula: see text]%, [Formula: see text]% and [Formula: see text]% respectively. The 3D-CNN-SVM yielded a ternary classification accuracy of 93.71%, 96.82% and 96.73% for NC, MCI and AD diagnoses, respectively. Furthermore, 3D-CNN-SVM showed the best performance for binary classification. Our study indicated that 'NC versus MCI' showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 98.90%, 98.90% and 98.80%; 'NC versus AD' showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99.10%, 99.80% and 98.40%; and 'MCI versus AD' showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 89.40%, 86.70% and 84.00%, respectively. This study clearly demonstrates that 3D-CNN-SVM yields better performance with MRI compared to currently utilized deep learning methods. In addition, 3D-CNN-SVM proved to be efficient without having to manually perform any prior feature extraction and is totally independent of the variability of imaging protocols and scanners. This suggests that it can potentially be exploited by untrained operators and extended to virtual patient imaging data. Furthermore, owing to the safety, noninvasiveness and nonirradiative properties of the MRI modality, 3D-CNN-SMV may serve as an effective screening option for AD in the general population. This study holds value in distinguishing AD and MCI subjects from normal controls and to improve value-based care of patients in clinical practice.","Feng, Halm-Lutterodt, Tang, Mecum, Mesregah, Ma, Li, Zhang, Wu, Yao, Guo","https://doi.org/10.1142/S012906572050032X","20200605","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; Deep learning; convolution neural networks; mild cognitive impairment; support vector machine; three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16729,""
"A systematic review of economic evaluations of treatment regimens in multiple myeloma","The expansion of advanced expensive therapeutic innovations for Multiple Myeloma (MM) led to increased disclosure of economic evaluations. The present analysis systematically reviewed and appraised the reporting quality of economic evaluations in MM. A comprehensive literature search in Ovid, MEDLINE(R), PubMed, and Cochrane libraries was conducted for studies published in the past decade. Two independent authors performed study selection and data extraction in a standardized form. Study methodological quality assessment was performed using 10-item Drummond's tool. Of potentially eligible 1150 retrieved studies, 17Ã‚Â met eligibility criteria. Six evaluations (35%) were in newly diagnosed MM and 11 (65%) in relapse refractory (RR) MM. Nine studies (53%) embraced the payer's perspective, five (29%) adopted health care system, one (6%) societal and two did not report. Six (35%) employed partitioned survival model, 4(24%) discrete event simulation, 4(24%) Markov model and 2(12%) used decision tree model. The methodological quality has improved significantly; 16 (94%) studies comprehended a well-defined question by affirming the analysis perspective and examined both costs and outcomes while 13 (71%) provided a comprehensive description of competing alternatives. The addition of novel drugs to the treatment armamentarium of MM is considerably cost-effective. The evaluations became more frequent, methodological quality has improved in the last decade.","Asrar, Lad, Prinja, Bansal","https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2020.1779064","20200629","Multiple myeloma; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; critical appraisal; health economics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16730,""
"Effectiveness of preventive measures against COVID-19: A systematic review of <i>In Silico</i> modeling studies in indian context","In the absence of any approved treatment or vaccine against novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) are the cornerstone to prevent the disease, especially in a populous country like India. To understand the effectiveness of NPIs reported in the contemporary literatures describing prediction models for prevention of the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 specifically in Indian population. Original research articles in English obtained through keyword search in PubMed, WHO Global Database for COVID19, and pre-print servers were included in the review. Thematic synthesis of extracted data from articles were done. Twenty-four articles were found eligible for the review - four published articles and twenty pre-print articles. Compartmental model was found to be the most commonly used mathematical model; along with exponential, time varying, neural network and cluster kinetic models. Social distancing, specifically lockdown, was the most commonly modelled intervention strategy. Additionally, contact tracing using smartphone application, international travel restriction, increasing hospital/ICU beds, changes in testing strategy were also dealt with. Social distancing along with increasing testing seemed to be effective in delaying the peak of the epidemic and reducing the peak prevalence. Although there is mathematical rationality behind implementation of social distancing measures including lockdown, this study also emphasised the importance of other associated measures like increasing tests and increasing the number of hospital and ICU beds. The later components are particularly important during the social mixing period to be observed after lifting of lockdown.","Lahiri, Jha, Bhattacharya, Ray, Chakraborty","https://doi.org/10.4103/ijph.IJPH_464_20","20200617","COVID-19; contact tracing; lockdown; mathematical model; preventive measures; quarantine; systematic review; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Disease Control; Computer Simulation; Contact Tracing; Coronavirus Infections; Disaster Planning; Humans; India; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Travel","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16731,""
"Aggregation and analysis of indication-symptom relationships for drugs approved in the USA","Drug indications and disease symptoms often confound adverse event reports in real-world datasets, including electronic health records and reports in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). A thorough, standardized set of indications and symptoms is needed to identify these confounders in such datasets for drug research and safety assessment. The aim of this study is to create a comprehensive list of drug-indication associations and disease-symptom associations using multiple resources, including existing databases and natural language processing. Drug indications for drugs approved in the USA were extracted from two databases, RxNorm and Side Effect Resource (SIDER). Symptoms for these indications were extracted from MedlinePlus and using natural language processing from PubMed abstracts. A total of 1361 unique drugs, 1656 unique indications, and 2201 unique symptoms were extracted from a wide variety of MedDRA System Organ Classes. Text-mining precision was maximized at 0.65 by examining Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) scores of the disease-symptom associations. The drug-indication associations and disease-symptom associations collected in this study may be useful in identifying confounders in other datasets, such as safety reports.

"WilsonGen a comprehensive clinically annotated genomic variant resource for Wilson's Disease","Wilson disease (WD) is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases with an estimated global carrier frequency of 1 in 90 and a prevalence of 1 in 30,000. The disease owes its genesis to Kinnier Wilson who described the disease, and is caused by accumulation of Copper (Cu) in various organs including the liver, central nervous system, cornea, kidney, joints and cardiac muscle which contribute to the characteristic clinical features of WD. A number of studies have reported genetic variants in the ATP7B gene from diverse ethnic and geographical origins. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing approaches has also enabled the discovery of a large number of novel variants in the gene associated with the disease. Previous attempts have been made to compile the knowledgebase and spectrum of genetic variants from across the multitude of publications, but have been limited by the utility due to the significant differences in approaches used to qualify pathogenicity of variants in each of the publications. The recent formulation of guidelines and algorithms for assessment of the pathogenicity of variants jointly put forward by the American College of Medical Genetics and the Association of Molecular Pathologists (ACMG &amp;AMP) has provided a framework for evidence based and systematic assessment of pathogenicity of variants. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive resource of genetic variants in ATP7B gene manually curated from literature and data resources and systematically annotated using the ACMG &amp; AMP guidelines for assessing pathogenicity. The resource therefore serves as a central point for clinicians and geneticists working on WD and to the best of our knowledge is the most comprehensive and only clinically annotated resource for WD. The resource is available at URL http://clingen.igib.res.in/WilsonGen/. We compiled a total of 3662 genetic variants from publications and databases associated with WD. Of these variants compiled, a total of 1458 were found to be unique entries. This is the largest WD database comprising 656 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants reported classified according to ACMG &amp; AMP guidelines. We also mapped all the pathogenic variants corresponding to ATP7B protein from literature and other databases. In addition, geographical origin and distribution of ATP7B pathogenic variants reported are also mapped in the database.","Kumar, Gaharwar, Paul, Poojary, Pandhare, Scaria, Bk","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-66099-2","20201009","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16733,""
"The semi-automation of title and abstract screening: a retrospective exploration of ways to leverage Abstrackr's relevance predictions in systematic and rapid reviews","We investigated the feasibility of using a machine learning tool's relevance predictions to expedite title and abstract screening. We subjected 11 systematic reviews and six rapid reviews to four retrospective screening simulations (automated and semi-automated approaches to single-reviewer and dual independent screening) in Abstrackr, a freely-available machine learning software. We calculated the proportion missed, workload savings, and time savings compared to single-reviewer and dual independent screening by human reviewers. We performed cited reference searches to determine if missed studies would be identified via reference list scanning. For systematic reviews, the semi-automated, dual independent screening approach provided the best balance of time savings (median (range) 20 (3-82) hours) and reliability (median (range) proportion missed records, 1 (0-14)%). The cited references search identified 59% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10/17) of the records missed. For the rapid reviews, the fully and semi-automated approaches saved time (median (range) 9 (2-18) hours and 3 (1-10) hours, respectively), but less so than for the systematic reviews. The median (range) proportion missed records for both approaches was 6 (0-22)%. Using Abstrackr to assist one of two reviewers in systematic reviews saves time with little risk of missing relevant records. Many missed records would be identified via other means.","Gates, Gates, Sebastianski, Guitard, Elliott, Hartling","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01031-w","20200609","Automation; Efficiency; Machine learning; Rapid reviews; Systematic reviews","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16734,""
"Neuro4Neuro: A neural network approach for neural tract segmentation using large-scale population-based diffusion imaging","Subtle changes in white matter (WM) microstructure have been associated with normal aging and neurodegeneration. To study these associations in more detail, it is highly important that the WM tracts can be accurately and reproducibly characterized from brain diffusion MRI. In addition, to enable analysis of WM tracts in large datasets and in clinical practice it is essential to have methodology that is fast and easy to apply. This work therefore presents a new approach for WM tract segmentation: Neuro4Neuro, that is capable of direct extraction of WM tracts from diffusion tensor images using convolutional neural network (CNN). This 3D end-to-end method is trained to segment 25 WM tracts in aging individuals from a large population-based study (NÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹=Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹9752, 1.5T MRI). The proposed method showed good segmentation performance and high reproducibility, i.e., a high spatial agreement (Cohen's kappa, ÃŽÂº=0.72-0.83) and a low scan-rescan error in tract-specific diffusion measures (e.g., fractional anisotropy: ÃŽÂµ=1%-5%). The reproducibility of the proposed method was higher than that of a tractography-based segmentation algorithm, while being orders of magnitude faster (0.5s to segment one tract). In addition, we showed that the method successfully generalizes to diffusion scans from an external dementia dataset (NÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹=Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹58, 3T MRI). In two proof-of-principle experiments, we associated WM microstructure obtained using the proposed method with age in a normal elderly population, and with disease subtypes in a dementia cohort. In concordance with the literature, results showed a widespread reduction of microstructural organization with aging and substantial group-wise microstructure differences between dementia subtypes. In conclusion, we presented a highly reproducible and fast method for WM tract segmentation that has the potential of being used in large-scale studies and clinical practice.","Li, de Groot, Steketee, Meijboom, Smits, Vernooij, Ikram, Liu, Niessen, Bron","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116993","20201020","CNN; Diffusion MRI; Neurodegeneration; Segmentation; White matter tract","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16735,""

"External validation of radiomics-based predictive models in low-dose CT screening for early lung cancer diagnosis","Low-dose CT screening allows early lung cancer detection, but is affected by frequent false positive results, inter/intra observer variation and uncertain diagnoses of lung nodules. Radiomics-based models have recently been introduced to overcome these issues, but limitations in demonstrating their generalizability on independent datasets are slowing their introduction to clinic. The aim of this study is to evaluate two radiomics-based models to classify malignant pulmonary nodules in low-dose CT screening, and to externally validate them on an independent cohort. The effect of a radiomics features harmonization technique is also investigated to evaluate its impact on the classification of lung nodules from a multicenter data. Pulmonary nodules from two independent cohorts were considered in this study; the first cohort (110 subjects, 113 nodules) was used to train prediction models, and the second cohort (72 nodules) to externally validate them. Literature-based radiomics features were extracted and, after feature selection, used as predictive variables in models for malignancy identification. An in-house prediction model based on artificial neural network (ANN) was implemented and evaluated, along with an alternative model from the literature, based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier coupled with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). External validation was performed on the second cohort to evaluate models' generalization ability. Additionally, the impact of the Combat harmonization method was investigated to compensate for multicenter datasets variabilities. A new training of the models based on harmonized features was performed on the first cohort, then tested separately on the harmonized and non-harmonized features of the second cohort. Preliminary results showed a good accuracy of the investigated models in distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules with both sets of radiomics features (i.e., non-harmonized and harmonized). The performance of the models, quantified in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC), wasÃ‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â 0.89 in the training set andÃ‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â 0.82 in the external validation set for all the investigated scenarios, outperforming the clinical standard (AUC of 0.76). Slightly higher performance was observed for the SVM-LASSO model than the ANN in the external dataset, although they did not result significantly different. For both harmonized and non-harmonized features, no statistical difference was found between Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves related to training and test set for both models. Although no significant improvements were observed when applying the Combat harmonization method, both in-house and literature-based models were able to classify lung nodules with good generalization to an independent dataset, thus showing their potential as tools for clinical decision-making in lung cancer screening.","Garau, Paganelli, Summers, Choi, Alam, Lu, Fanciullo, Bellomi, Baroni, Rampinelli","https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14308","20200623","low-dose CT screening; lung nodules classification; radiomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16738,""

The terms &quot;cirrhosis,&quot; &quot;management,&quot; and &quot;quality of life&quot; emerged most frequently and indicated the hotspots in liver cirrhosis nursing literature. Among all countries/regions, the United States contributed the most research overall; Asia also played an important role in the field of liver cirrhosis nursing research. The journal Gastroenterology Nursing published the greatest number of articles.

"SCDb: an integrated database of stomach cancer","Stomach cancer (SC) is a type of cancer, which is derived from the stomach mucous membrane. As there are non-specific symptoms or no noticeable symptoms observed at the early stage, newly diagnosed SC cases usually reach an advanced stage and are thus difficult to cure. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop an integrated database of SC. SC-related genes were identified through literature mining and by analyzing the publicly available microarray datasets. Using the RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and clinical data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves for all the SC-related genes were generated and analyzed. The miRNAs (miRanda, miRTarget2, PicTar, PITA and TargetScan databases), SC-related miRNAs (HMDD and miR2Disease databases), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, dbSNP database), and SC-related SNPs (ClinVar database) were also retrieved from the indicated databases. Moreover, gene_disease (OMIM and GAD databases), copy number variation (CNV, DGV database), methylation (PubMeth database), drug (WebGestalt database), and transcription factor (TF, TRANSFAC database) analyses were performed for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In total, 9990 SC-related genes (including 8347 up-regulated genes and 1643 down-regulated genes) were identified, among which, 65 genes were further confirmed as SC-related genes by performing enrichment analysis. Besides this, 457 miRNAs, 20 SC-related miRNAs, 1570 SNPs, 108 SC-related SNPs, 419 TFs, 44,605 CNVs, 3404 drug-associated genes, 63 genes with methylation, and KM survival curves of 20,264 genes were obtained. By integrating these datasets, an integrated database of stomach cancer, designated as SCDb, (available at http://www.stomachcancerdb.org/) was established. As a comprehensive resource for human SC, SCDb database will be very useful for performing SC-related research in future, and will thus promote the understanding of the pathogenesis of SC.","Gu, Song, Liu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-020-06869-3","20200608","Database; Differentially expressed gene; Single nucleotide polymorphism; Stomach cancer; microRNA","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16740,""
"Imaging-Based Prediction of Molecular Therapy Targets in NSCLC by Radiogenomics and AI Approaches: A Systematic Review","The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the current state of the art of imaging-derived biomarkers predictive of genetic alterations and immunotherapy targets in lung cancer. We included original research studies reporting the development and validation of imaging feature-based models. The overall quality, the standard of reporting and the advancements towards clinical practice were assessed. Eighteen out of the 24 selected articles were classified as &quot;high-quality&quot; studies according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2). The 18 &quot;high-quality papers&quot; adhered to Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) with a mean of 62.9%. The majority of &quot;high-quality&quot; studies (16/18) were classified as phase II. The most commonly used imaging predictors were radiomic features, followed by visual qualitative computed tomography (CT) features, convolutional neural network-based approaches and positron emission tomography (PET) parameters, all used alone or combined with clinicopathologic features. The majority (14/18) were focused on the prediction of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. Thirty-five imaging-based models were built to predict the EGFR status. The model's performances ranged from weak (n = 5) to acceptable (n = 11), to excellent (n = 18) and outstanding (n = 1) in the validation set. Positive outcomes were also reported for the prediction of ALK rearrangement, ALK/ROS1/RET fusions and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Despite the promising results in terms of predictive performance, image-based models, suffering from methodological bias, require further validation before replacing traditional molecular pathology testing.","Ninatti, Kirienko, Neri, Sollini, Chiti","https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10060359","20200928","ALK; CT; EGFR; PD-L1; PET/CT; artificial intelligence; lung cancer; radiogenomics; radiomics; targeted therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16741,""
"Artificial intelligence (AI) in urology-Current use and future directions: An iTRUE study","Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in various urological conditions such as urolithiasis, pediatric urology, urogynecology, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), renal transplant, and uro-oncology. The various models of AI and its application in urology subspecialties are reviewed and discussed. Search strategy was adapted to identify and review the literature pertaining to the application of AI in urology using the keywords &quot;urology,&quot; &quot;artificial intelligence,&quot; &quot;machine learning,&quot; &quot;deep learning,&quot; &quot;artificial neural networks,&quot; &quot;computer vision,&quot; and &quot;natural language processing&quot; were included and categorized. Review articles, editorial comments, and non-urologic studies were excluded. The article reviewed 47 articles that reported characteristics and implementation of AI in urological cancer. In all cases with benign conditions, artificial intelligence was used to predict outcomes of the surgical procedure. In urolithiasis, it was used to predict stone composition, whereas in pediatric urology and BPH, it was applied to predict the severity of condition. In cases with malignant conditions, it was applied to predict the treatment response, survival, prognosis, and recurrence on the basis of the genomic and biomarker studies. These results were also found to be statistically better than routine approaches. Application of radiomics in classification and nuclear grading of renal masses, cystoscopic diagnosis of bladder cancers, predicting Gleason score, and magnetic resonance imaging with computer-assisted diagnosis for prostate cancers are few applications of AI that have been studied extensively. In the near future, we will see a shift in the clinical paradigm as AI applications will find their place in the guidelines and revolutionize the decision-making process.","Shah, Naik, Somani, Hameed","https://doi.org/10.5152/tud.2020.20117","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16742,""
"Management of oligometastatic and oligoprogressive renal cell carcinoma: state of the art and future directions","The aim of this paper was to perform a narrative review of the literature on the available approaches in the treatment of two emerging subpopulations of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients: the oligometastatic disease (less than 5 metastasis) and the oligoprogressive disease, defined as worsening in maximum 3-5 sites while all other tumor sites are controlled by systemic therapy. We explore all possible approaches in these settings of patients: the role of local therapies, considering both surgical metastasectomy and/or ablative techniques, the efficacy of systemic therapies and the rationale behind active surveillance. We also discuss ongoing clinical trials in these settings. Two different strategies are emerging as the most promising for the approach to the oligometastatic/oligoprogressive mRCC patient: (1) the use of immunocheckpoint inhibitors following metastasectomy; (2) the use of stereotactic radiotherapy alone or combined with immunotherapy for oligometastatic disease. The lack of validated biomarkers of response in these mRCC patient subpopulations is opening the way to the employment of novel technologies. Among them, the use of artificial intelligence seems to be the candidate to contribute to precision oncology in patients with mRCC.","Donini, Buti, Massari, Mollica, Rizzo, Montironi, Bersanelli, Santoni","https://doi.org/10.1080/14737140.2020.1770601","20200713","Active surveillance; loco-regional treatments; metastasectomy; oligometastatic; oligoprogression; oligoprogressive; radiotherapy; renal cell carcinoma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16743,""
"Implementation of a Real-Time Psychosis Risk Detection and Alerting System Based on Electronic Health Records using CogStack","Recent studies have shown that an automated, lifespan-inclusive, transdiagnostic, and clinically based, individualized risk calculator provides a powerful system for supporting the early detection of individuals at-risk of psychosis at a large scale, by leveraging electronic health records (EHRs). This risk calculator has been externally validated twice and is undergoing feasibility testing for clinical implementation. Integration of this risk calculator in clinical routine should be facilitated by prospective feasibility studies, which are required to address pragmatic challenges, such as missing data, and the usability of this risk calculator in a real-world and routine clinical setting. Here, we present an approach for a prospective implementation of a real-time psychosis risk detection and alerting service in a real-world EHR system. This method leverages the CogStack platform, which is an open-source, lightweight, and distributed information retrieval and text extraction system. The CogStack platform incorporates a set of services that allow for full-text search of clinical data, lifespan-inclusive, real-time calculation of psychosis risk, early risk-alerting to clinicians, and the visual monitoring of patients over time. Our method includes: 1) ingestion and synchronization of data from multiple sources into the CogStack platform, 2) implementation of a risk calculator, whose algorithm was previously developed and validated, for timely computation of a patient's risk of psychosis, 3) creation of interactive visualizations and dashboards to monitor patients' health status over time, and 4) building automated alerting systems to ensure that clinicians are notified of patients at-risk, so that appropriate actions can be pursued. This is the first ever study that has developed and implemented a similar detection and alerting system in clinical routine for early detection of psychosis.","Wang, Oliver, Msosa, Colling, Spada, Roguski, Folarin, Stewart, Roberts, Dobson, Fusar-Poli","https://doi.org/10.3791/60794","20201019","Algorithms; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Prospective Studies; Psychotic Disorders; Risk Assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16744,""
"Paraphrasing to improve the performance of Electronic Health Records Question Answering","This paper describes a paraphrasing approach to improve the performance of question answering (QA) for electronic health records (EHRs). QA systems for structured EHR data usually rely on semantic parsing, which aims to generate machine-understandable logical forms from free-text questions. Training semantic parsers requires large datasets of question-logical form (QL) pairs, which are labor-intensive to create. Considering the scarcity of large QL datasets in the clinical domain, we propose a framework for expanding an existing dataset using paraphrasing. We experiment with different heuristics for multiple sample sizes and iterations to assess the effect of adding paraphrasing to the task of semantic parsing. We found that adding paraphrases to an existing dataset based on TERTHRESHOLD scores results in an improved performance in the majority (74%) of the experimental runs. Hence, the proposed paraphrasing-based framework has the potential to improve the performance of QA systems using a limited set of existing QL annotations.","Soni, Roberts","https://www.google.com/search?q=Paraphrasing+to+improve+the+performance+of+Electronic+Health+Records+Question+Answering.","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16745,""
"Patient Representation Transfer Learning from Clinical Notes based on Hierarchical Attention Network","To explicitly learn patient representations from longitudinal clinical notes, we propose a hierarchical attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) with greedy segmentation to distinguish between shorter and longer, more meaningful gaps between notes. The proposed model is evaluated for both a direct clinical prediction task (mortality) and as a transfer learning pre-training model to downstream evaluation (phenotype prediction of obesity and its comorbidities). Experimental results first show the proposed model with appropriate segmentation achieved the best performance on mortality prediction, indicating the effectiveness of hierarchical RNNs in dealing with longitudinal clinical text. Attention weights from the models highlight those parts of notes with the largest impact on mortality prediction and hopefully provide a degree of interpretability. Following the transfer learning approach, we also demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of pre-trained patient representations on target tasks of phenotyping.","Si, Roberts","https://www.google.com/search?q=Patient+Representation+Transfer+Learning+from+Clinical+Notes+based+on+Hierarchical+Attention+Network.","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16746,""

"Automating the Transformation of Free-Text Clinical Problems into SNOMED CT Expressions","An important function of the patient record is to effectively and concisely communicate patient problems. In many cases, these problems are represented as short textual summarizations and appear in various sections of the record including problem lists, diagnoses, and chief complaints. While free-text problem descriptions effectively capture the clinicians' intent, these unstructured representations are problematic for downstream analytics. We present an automated approach to converting free-text problem descriptions into structured Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) expressions. Our methods focus on incorporating new advances in deep learning to build formal semantic representations of summary level clinical problems from text.

"Building Cancer Diagnosis Text to OncoTree Mapping Pipelines for Clinical Sequencing Data Integration and Curation","Precision oncology research seeks to derive knowledge from existing data. Current work seeks to integrate clinical and genomic data across cancer centers to enable impactful secondary use. However, integrated data reliability depends on the data curation method used and its systematicity. In practice, data integration and mapping are often done manually even though crucial data such as oncological diagnoses (DX) show varying accuracy and specificity levels. We hypothesized that mapping of text-form cancer DX to a standardized terminology (OncoTree) could be automated using existing methods (e.g. natural language processing (NLP) modules and application programming interfaces [APIs]). We found that our best-performing pipeline prototype was effective but limited by API development limitations (accurately mapped 96.2% of textual DX dataset to NCI Thesaurus (NCIt), 44.2% through NCIt to OncoTree).

"Neoplastic and Non-neoplastic Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage in CT Brain Scans: Machine Learning-Based Prediction Using Radiomic Image Features","<b>Background:</b> Early differentiation of neoplastic and non-neoplastic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) can be difficult in initial radiological evaluation, especially for extensive ICHs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of a machine learning-based prediction of etiology for acute ICHs based on quantitative radiomic image features extracted from initial non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (NECT) brain scans. <b>Methods:</b> The analysis included NECT brain scans from 77 patients with acute ICH (<i>n</i> = 50 non-neoplastic, <i>n</i> = 27 neoplastic). Radiomic features including shape, histogram, and texture markers were extracted from non-, wavelet-, and log-sigma-filtered images using regions of interest of ICH and perihematomal edema (PHE). Six thousand and ninety quantitative predictors were evaluated utilizing random forest algorithms with five-fold model-external cross-validation. Model stability was assessed through comparative analysis of 10 randomly drawn cross-validation sets. Classifier performance was compared with predictions of two radiologists employing the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). <b>Results:</b> The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of the test sets for predicting neoplastic vs. non-neoplastic ICHs was 0.89 [95% CI (0.70; 0.99); <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001], and specificities and sensitivities reached &gt;80%. Compared to the radiologists' predictions, the machine learning algorithm yielded equal or superior results for all evaluated metrics. The MCC of the proposed algorithm at its optimal operating point (0.69) was significantly higher than the MCC of the radiologist readers (0.54); <i>P</i> = 0.01. <b>Conclusion:</b> Evaluating quantitative features of acute NECT images in a machine learning algorithm provided high discriminatory power in predicting non-neoplastic vs. neoplastic ICHs.

"Fully automated segmentation of the right ventricle in patients with repaired Tetralogy of Fallot using U-Net","Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is considered the standard imaging modality for volumetric analysis of the right ventricle (RV), an especially important practice in the evaluation of heart structure and function in patients with repaired Tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF). In clinical practice, however, this requires time-consuming manual delineation of the RV endocardium in multiple 2-dimensional (2D) slices at multiple phases of the cardiac cycle. In this work, we employed a U-Net based 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier in the fully automatic segmentation of the RV blood pool. Our dataset was comprised of 5,729 short-axis cine CMR slices taken from 100 individuals with rTOF. Training of our CNN model was performed on images from 50 individuals while validation was performed on images from 10 individuals. Segmentation results were evaluated by Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance (HD). Use of the CNN model on our testing group of 40 individuals yielded a median DSC of 90% and a median 95<sup>th</sup> percentile HD of 5.1 mm, demonstrating good performance in these metrics when compared to literature results.

"Development and Validation of a Natural Language Processing Algorithm for Surveillance of Cervical and Anal Cancer and Precancer: A Split-validation Study","Accurate identification of new diagnoses of human papillomavirus (HPV) associated cancers and precancers is an important step towards the development of strategies that optimize the use of HPV vaccines. The diagnosis of HPV cancers hinges on a histopathologic report, which is typically stored in the electronic medical records (EMR) as free-form, or unstructured narrative text. Previous efforts to perform surveillance for HPV cancers have relied on the manual review of pathology reports to extract diagnostic information, a process that is both labor- and resource-intensive. Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to automate the structuring and extraction of clinical data from unstructured narrative text in medical records and may provide a practical and effective method for identifying patients with HPV vaccine-preventable disease for surveillance and research. The objective of this study was to develop and assess the accuracy of a NLP algorithm for identification of individuals with cancer or pre-cancer of the cervix and anus. A pipeline-based NLP algorithm was developed, which incorporated both machine-learning and rule-based methods to extract diagnostic elements from the narrative pathology reports. To test the algorithm's classification accuracy, we used a split-validation study design. Full length cervical and anal pathology reports were randomly selected from 4 clinical pathology laboratories. Two study team members, blinded to the classifications produced by the NLP algorithm, manually and independently reviewed all reports and classified them at the document level according to two domains (diagnosis and HPV testing results). Using the manual review as the &quot;gold-standard&quot;, the algorithm's performance was evaluated using standard measurements of accuracy (true positive and true negatives / total number of reports), recall (true positives / positive reports by gold-standard), precision (true positives / positive reports by NLP), and f-measure (harmonic mean of recall and precision). The NLP algorithm's performance was validated on 949 pathology reports (anal cytology = 105, anal histology = 95, cervical cytology = 449, and cervical histology = 404). The NLP algorithm demonstrated accurate identification of abnormal cytology, histology, and positive HPV tests with accuracies greater than 0.91 in all specimens. Precision (also known as positive predictive value) was lowest for anal histology reports (0.87; 95%CI = 0.59-0.98) and highest for cervical cytology (0.98; 95%CI= 0.95-0.99). The NLP algorithm missed two out of the 15 abnormal anal histology reports, which led to the relatively low recall/sensitivity (0.68; 95%CI= 0.43-0.87). This study outlines the development and validity testing of a freely available and easily implementable NLP algorithm that is able to automate the extraction and classification of clinical data from cervical and anal cytology and histology reports with high accuracy.

"Using Twitter to Surveil the Opioid Epidemic in North Carolina: An Exploratory Study","Over the last two decades, deaths associated with opioids have escalated in number and geographic spread, impacting more and more individuals, families, and communities. Reflecting on the shifting nature of the opioid overdose crisis, Dasgupta, Beletsky, and Ciccarone offer a triphasic framework to explain that opioid overdose deaths (OODs) shifted from prescription opioids for pain (beginning in 2000), to heroin (2010 to 2015), and then to synthetic opioids (beginning in 2013). Given the rapidly shifting nature of OODs, timelier surveillance data are critical to inform strategies that combat the opioid crisis. Using easily accessible and near real-time social media data to improve public health surveillance efforts related to the opioid crisis is a promising area of research. This study explored the potential of using Twitter data to monitor the opioid epidemic. Specifically, this study investigated the extent to which the content of opioid-related tweets corresponds with the triphasic nature of the opioid crisis and correlates with OODs in North Carolina between 2009 and 2017. Opioid-related Twitter posts were obtained using Crimson Hexagon, and were classified as relating to prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids using natural language processing. This process resulted in a corpus of 100,777 posts consisting of tweets, retweets, mentions, and replies. Using a random sample of 10,000 posts from the corpus, we identified opioid-related terms by analyzing word frequency for each year. OODs were obtained from the Multiple Cause of Death database from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER). Least squares regression and Granger tests compared patterns of opioid-related posts with OODs. The pattern of tweets related to prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids resembled the triphasic nature of OODs. For prescription opioids, tweet counts and OODs were statistically unrelated. Tweets mentioning heroin and synthetic opioids were significantly associated with heroin OODs and synthetic OODs in the same year (P=.01 and P&lt;.001, respectively), as well as in the following year (P=.03 and P=.01, respectively). Moreover, heroin tweets in a given year predicted heroin deaths better than lagged heroin OODs alone (P=.03). Findings support using Twitter data as a timely indicator of opioid overdose mortality, especially for heroin.","Anwar, Khoury, Aldridge, Parker, Conway","https://doi.org/10.2196/17574","20200807","opioids; social media; surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16757,""
"AOP4EUpest: mapping of pesticides in adverse outcome pathways using a text mining tool","Exposure to pesticides may lead to adverse health effects in human populations, in particular vulnerable groups. The main long-term health concerns are neurodevelopmental disorders, carcinogenicity as well as endocrine disruption possibly leading to reproductive and metabolic disorders. Adverse outcome pathways (AOP) consist in linear representations of mechanistic perturbations at different levels of the biological organization. Although AOPs are chemical-agnostic, they can provide a better understanding of the Mode of Action of pesticides and can support a rational identification of effect markers. With the increasing amount of scientific literature and the development of biological databases, investigation of putative links between pesticides, from various chemical groups and AOPs using the biological events present in the AOP-Wiki database is now feasible. To identify co-occurrence between a specific pesticide and a biological event in scientific abstracts from the PubMed database, we used an updated version of the artificial intelligence-based AOP-helpFinder tool. This allowed us to decipher multiple links between the studied substances and molecular initiating events, key events and adverse outcomes. These results were collected, structured and presented in a web application named AOP4EUpest that can support regulatory assessment of the prioritized pesticides and trigger new epidemiological and experimental studies. http://www.biomedicale.parisdescartes.fr/aop4EUpest/home.php.

"Interpretable multimodal deep learning for real-time pan-tissue pan-disease pathology search on social media","Pathologists are responsible for rapidly providing a diagnosis on critical health issues. Challenging cases benefit from additional opinions of pathologist colleagues. In addition to on-site colleagues, there is an active worldwide community of pathologists on social media for complementary opinions. Such access to pathologists worldwide has the capacity to improve diagnostic accuracy and generate broader consensus on next steps in patient care. From Twitter we curate 13,626 images from 6,351 tweets from 25 pathologists from 13 countries. We supplement the Twitter data with 113,161 images from 1,074,484 PubMed articles. We develop machine learning and deep learning models to (i) accurately identify histopathology stains, (ii) discriminate between tissues, and (iii) differentiate disease states. Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) is 0.805-0.996 for these tasks. We repurpose the disease classifier to search for similar disease states given an image and clinical covariates. We report precision@kÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.7618Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0018 (chance 0.397Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004, meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±stdevÃ¢â‚¬â€°). The classifiers find that texture and tissue are important clinico-visual features of disease. Deep features trained only on natural images (e.g., cats and dogs) substantially improved search performance, while pathology-specific deep features and cell nuclei features further improved search to a lesser extent. We implement a social media bot (@pathobot on Twitter) to use the trained classifiers to aid pathologists in obtaining real-time feedback on challenging cases. If a social media post containing pathology text and images mentions the bot, the bot generates quantitative predictions of disease state (normal/artifact/infection/injury/nontumor, preneoplastic/benign/low-grade-malignant-potential, or malignant) and lists similar cases across social media and PubMed. Our project has become a globally distributed expert system that facilitates pathological diagnosis and brings expertise to underserved regions or hospitals with less expertise in a particular disease. This is the first pan-tissue pan-disease (i.e., from infection to malignancy) method for prediction and search on social media, and the first pathology study prospectively tested in public on social media. We will share data through http://pathobotology.org . We expect our project to cultivate a more connected world of physicians and improve patient care worldwide.","Schaumberg, Juarez-Nicanor, Choudhury, PastriÃƒÂ¡n, Pritt, Prieto Pozuelo, Sotillo SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Ho, Zahra, Sener, Yip, Xu, Annavarapu, Morini, Jones, Rosado-Orozco, Mukhopadhyay, Miguel, Yang, Rosen, Ali, Folaranmi, Gardner, Rusu, Stayerman, Gross, Suleiman, Sirintrapun, Aly, Fuchs","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41379-020-0540-1","20201026","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16759,""
"Clinical Application of Image Analysis in Pathology","Quantitative biomarkers are key prognostic and predictive factors in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In the clinical laboratory, the majority of biomarker quantitation is still performed manually, but digital image analysis (DIA) methods have been steadily growing and account for around 25% of all quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing performed today. Quantitative DIA is primarily employed in the analysis of breast cancer IHC biomarkers, including estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu; more recently clinical applications have expanded to include human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu in gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas and Ki-67 in both breast cancer and gastrointestinal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Evidence in the literature suggests that DIA has significant benefits over manual quantitation of IHC biomarkers, such as increased objectivity, accuracy, and reproducibility. Despite this fact, a number of barriers to the adoption of DIA in the clinical laboratory persist. These include difficulties in integrating DIA into clinical workflows, lack of standards for integrating DIA software with laboratory information systems and digital pathology systems, costs of implementing DIA, inadequate reimbursement relative to those costs, and other factors. These barriers to adoption may be overcome with international standards such as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), increased adoption of routine digital pathology workflows, the application of artificial intelligence to DIA, and the emergence of new clinical applications for DIA.","Cornish","https://doi.org/10.1097/PAP.0000000000000263","20200617","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16760,""
"Challenges of Clustering Multimodal Clinical Data: Review of Applications in Asthma Subtyping","In the current era of personalized medicine, there is increasing interest in understanding the heterogeneity in disease populations. Cluster analysis is a method commonly used to identify subtypes in heterogeneous disease populations. The clinical data used in such applications are typically multimodal, which can make the application of traditional cluster analysis methods challenging. This study aimed to review the research literature on the application of clustering multimodal clinical data to identify asthma subtypes. We assessed common problems and shortcomings in the application of cluster analysis methods in determining asthma subtypes, such that they can be brought to the attention of the research community and avoided in future studies. We searched PubMed and Scopus bibliographic databases with terms related to cluster analysis and asthma to identify studies that applied dissimilarity-based cluster analysis methods. We recorded the analytic methods used in each study at each step of the cluster analysis process. Our literature search identified 63 studies that applied cluster analysis to multimodal clinical data to identify asthma subtypes. The features fed into the cluster algorithms were of a mixed type in 47 (75%) studies and continuous in 12 (19%), and the feature type was unclear in the remaining 4 (6%) studies. A total of 23 (37%) studies used hierarchical clustering with Ward linkage, and 22 (35%) studies used k-means clustering. Of these 45 studies, 39 had mixed-type features, but only 5 specified dissimilarity measures that could handle mixed-type features. A further 9 (14%) studies used a preclustering step to create small clusters to feed on a hierarchical method. The original sample sizes in these 9 studies ranged from 84 to 349. The remaining studies used hierarchical clustering with other linkages (n=3), medoid-based methods (n=3), spectral clustering (n=1), and multiple kernel k-means clustering (n=1), and in 1 study, the methods were unclear. Of 63 studies, 54 (86%) explained the methods used to determine the number of clusters, 24 (38%) studies tested the quality of their cluster solution, and 11 (17%) studies tested the stability of their solution. Reporting of the cluster analysis was generally poor in terms of the methods employed and their justification. This review highlights common issues in the application of cluster analysis to multimodal clinical data to identify asthma subtypes. Some of these issues were related to the multimodal nature of the data, but many were more general issues in the application of cluster analysis. Although cluster analysis may be a useful tool for investigating disease subtypes, we recommend that future studies carefully consider the implications of clustering multimodal data, the cluster analysis process itself, and the reporting of methods to facilitate replication and interpretation of findings.","Horne, Tibble, Sheikh, Tsanas","https://doi.org/10.2196/16452","20200928","asthma; cluster analysis; data mining; machine learning; unsupervised machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16761,""
"Detection of sensorimotor contingencies in infants before the age of 1 year: A comprehensive review","To benefit from the exploration of their bodies and their physical and social environments, infants need to detect sensorimotor contingencies linking their actions to sensory feedback. This ability, which seems to be present in babies from birth and even in utero, has been widely used by researchers in their study of early development. However, a careful review of the literature, particularly the recent literature, suggests that babies may not be uniformly sensitive to all sensorimotor contingencies. This literature review examines in detail sensorimotor contingency detection in infants before the age of 1 year. Four aspects of sensorimotor contingency detection are considered: characteristics of action and feedback, contingency parameters, exposure conditions, and interindividual differences. For each topic, we highlight what favors and what hinders the detection of sensorimotor contingencies in infants. Our review also demonstrates the limitations of our knowledge about sensorimotor contingency detection. We emphasize the importance of making progress in this field at a time when sensorimotor contingency detection is of major interest in developmental robotics and artificial intelligence.

"Nucleus accumbens shell: A potential target for drug-resistant epilepsy with neuropsychiatric disorders","The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is an important component of the ventral striatum, involving motivational and emotional processes, limbic-motor interfaces. Recently, experimental and clinical data have shown that NAc, particularly NAc shell (NAcs), participates in ictogenesis and epileptogensis in drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Therefore, we summarize the existing literature on NAcs and potential role in epilepsy, from the bench to the clinic. Connection abnormalities between NAcs and remainings, degeneration of NAc neurons, and an aberrant distribution of neuroactive substances have been reported in patients with DRE. These changes may be underlying the pathophysiological mechanism of the involvement of NAcs in DRE. Furthermore, alterations in NAcs may also be involved in neuropsychiatric disorders in patients with DRE. These observational studies demonstrate the multiple properties of NAcs and the complex relationship between the limbic system and DRE with neuropsychiatric disorders. NAcs can be a potential target for DBS and stereotactic lesioning to manage DRE with neuropsychiatric disorders. Future studies are warranted to further clarify the role of NAcs in epilepsy.","Wang, Zhang, Zhang, Wang, Wang, Qian, Qi, Yang, Long","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2020.106365","20200611","Deep brain stimulation; Drug-Resistant epilepsy; Neuropsychological disorders; Nucleus accumbens shell","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16763,""
"Unique insights from ClinicalTrialsgov by mining protein mutations and RSids in addition to applying the Human Phenotype Ontology","Researchers and clinicians face a significant challenge in keeping up-to-date with the rapid rate of new associations between genetic mutations and diseases. To remedy this problem, this research mined the ClinicalTrials.gov corpus to extract relevant biological insights, produce unique reports to summarize findings, and make the meta-data available via APIs. An automated text-analysis pipeline performed the following features: parsing the ClinicalTrials.gov files, extracting and analyzing mutations from the corpus, mapping clinical trials to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), and finding associations between clinical trials and HPO nodes. Unique reports were created for each mutation (SNPs and protein mutations) mentioned in the corpus, as well as for each clinical trial that references a mutation. These reports, which have been run over multiple time points, along with APIs to access meta-data, are freely available at http://snpminertrials.com. Additionally, HPO was used to normalize disease terms and associate clinical trials with relevant genes. The creation of the pipeline and reports, the association of clinical trials with HPO terms, and the insights, public repository, and APIs produced are all novel in this work. The freely-available resources present relevant biological information and novel insights between biomedical entities in a robust and accessible manner, mitigating the challenge of being informed about new associations between mutations, genes, and diseases.","Alag","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233438","20200820","Biological Ontologies; Clinical Trials as Topic; Data Mining; Disease; Humans; Internet; Mutation; Phenotype; Terminology as Topic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16764,""
"Perioperative Considerations for Tracheostomies in the Era of COVID-19","The morbidity, mortality, and blistering pace of transmission of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an unprecedented worldwide health crisis. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease produced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is remarkable for persistent, severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation that places considerable strain on critical care resources. Because recovery from COVID-19-associated respiratory failure can be prolonged, tracheostomy may facilitate patient management and optimize the use of mechanical ventilators. Several important considerations apply to plan tracheostomies for COVID-19-infected patients. After performing a literature review of tracheostomies during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, we synthesized important learning points from these experiences and suggested an approach for perioperative teams involved in these procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multidisciplinary teams should be involved in decisions regarding timing and appropriateness of the procedure. As the theoretical risk of disease transmission is increased during aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), stringent infectious precautions are warranted. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be available and worn by all personnel present during tracheostomy. The number of people in the room should be limited to those absolutely necessary. Using the most experienced available operators will minimize the total time that staff is exposed to an infectious aerosolized environment. An approach that secures the airway in the safest and quickest manner will minimize the time any part of the airway is open to the environment. Deep neuromuscular blockade (train-of-four ratio = 0) will facilitate surgical exposure and prevent aerosolization due to patient movement or coughing. For percutaneous tracheostomies, the bronchoscopist should be able to reintubate if needed. Closed-loop communication must occur at all times among members of the team. If possible, after tracheostomy is performed, waiting until the patient is virus-free before changing the cannula or downsizing may reduce the chances of health care worker infection. Tracheostomies in COVID-19 patients present themselves as extremely high risk for all members of the procedural team. To mitigate risk, systematic meticulous planning of each procedural step is warranted along with strict adherence to local/institutional protocols.","Gosling, Bose, Gomez, Parikh, Cook, Sarge, Shaefi, Leibowitz","https://doi.org/10.1213/ANE.0000000000005009","20200722","Aerosols; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Occupational Exposure; Operative Time; Pandemics; Patient Care Team; Perioperative Care; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Tracheostomy; Treatment Outcome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16765,""
"Study on the relationship between reduced scattering coefficient and Young's modulus of tumors in microwave ablation","<b>Background and objective:</b> In the clinical treatment of tumors using microwave ablation (MWA), although temperature can be used as an important reference index for evaluating the curative effect of ablation, it cannot fully reflect the biological activity status of tumor tissue during thermal ablation. Finding multi-parameter comprehensive evaluation factors to achieve real-time evaluation of therapeutic effects has become the key for precise ablation. More and more scholars use the reduced scattering coefficient ([Formula: see text]) and Young's modulus (E) to evaluate the treatment outcomes of MWA. However, the intrinsic relationship between these parameters is unclear. This paper aims to investigate the specific relationship between [Formula: see text] and E during MWA.<b>Material and methods:</b> The MWA experiment was conducted on porcine liver <i>inÃ‚Â vitro</i>, the two-parameter simultaneous acquisition system was designed to obtain the reduced scattering coefficient and Young's modulus of the liver tissue during MWA. The relationship between reduced scattering coefficient and Young's modulus was investigated.<b>Results:</b> It is found that the trend of change of [Formula: see text] is very similar to E in the process of MWA, i.e. first increasing and then reaching a steady state, and in some experiments there are synchronous changes. Based on this, the quantitative relationship between E-[Formula: see text] is established, enabling the quantitative estimation of Young's modulus of liver tissue based on reduced scattering coefficient. The maximum absolute error is 29.37Ã¢â‚¬â€°kPa and the minimum absolute error is 0.88Ã¢â‚¬â€°kPa.<b>Conclusion:</b> This study contributes to the further establishment of a multi-parameter MWA effectiveness evaluation model. It is also valuable for clinically evaluating the ablation outcomes of tumor in real time.","Jin, Li, Liu, Mu, Wang, Qian, Li, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1080/13645706.2020.1742742","20200527","MWA; YoungÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s modulus; reduced scattering coefficient","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16766,""
"The Effects of Technological Developments on Work and Their Implications for Continuous Vocational Education and Training: A Systematic Review","Technology is changing the way organizations and their employees need to accomplish their work. Empirical evidence on this topic is scarce. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the effects of technological developments on work characteristics and to derive the implications for work demands and continuous vocational education and training (CVET). The following research questions are answered: What are the effects of new technologies on work characteristics? What are the implications thereof for continuous vocational education and training? Technologies, defined as digital, electrical or mechanical tools that affect the accomplishment of work tasks, are considered in various disciplines, such as sociology or psychology. A theoretical framework based on theories from these disciplines (e.g., upskilling, task-based approach) was developed and statements on the relationships between technology and work characteristics, such as complexity, autonomy, or meaningfulness, were derived. A systematic literature review was conducted by searching databases from the fields of psychology, sociology, economics and educational science. Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Empirical evidence was extracted and its implications for work demands and CVET were derived by using a model that illustrates the components of learning environments. Evidence indicates an increase in complexity and mental work, especially while working with automated systems and robots. Manual work is reported to decrease on many occasions. Workload and workflow interruptions increase simultaneously with autonomy, especially with regard to digital communication devices. Role expectations and opportunities for development depend on how the profession and the technology relate to each other, especially when working with automated systems. The implications for the work demands necessary to deal with changes in work characteristics include knowledge about technology, openness toward change and technology, skills for self- and time management and for further professional and career development. Implications for the design of formal learning environments (i.e., the content, method, assessment, and guidance) include that the work demands mentioned must be part of the content of the trainings, the teachers/trainers must be equipped to promote those work demands, and that instruction models used for the learning environments must be flexible in their application.","Beer, Mulder","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00918","20200928","automation; continuous vocational education and training; systematic review; technology; work characteristics; work demands","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16767,""
"Predicting Phenotypic Polymyxin Resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae through Machine Learning Analysis of Genomic Data","Polymyxins are used as treatments of last resort for Gram-negative bacterial infections. Their increased use has led to concerns about emerging polymyxin resistance (PR). Phenotypic polymyxin susceptibility testing is resource intensive and difficult to perform accurately. The complex polygenic nature of PR and our incomplete understanding of its genetic basis make it difficult to predict PR using detection of resistance determinants. We therefore applied machine learning (ML) to whole-genome sequencing data from &gt;600 <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> clonal group 258 (CG258) genomes to predict phenotypic PR. Using a reference-based representation of genomic data with ML outperformed a rule-based approach that detected variants in known PR genes (area under receiver-operator curve [AUROC], 0.894 versus 0.791, <i>PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°</i>0.006). We noted modest increases in performance by using a bacterial genome-wide association study to filter relevant genomic features and by integrating clinical data in the form of prior polymyxin exposure. Conversely, reference-free representation of genomic data as k-mers was associated with decreased performance (AUROC, 0.692 versus 0.894, <i>PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°</i>0.015). When ML models were interpreted to extract genomic features, six of seven known PR genes were correctly identified by models without prior programming and several genes involved in stress responses and maintenance of the cell membrane were identified as potential novel determinants of PR. These findings are a proof of concept that whole-genome sequencing data can accurately predict PR in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> CG258 and may be applicable to other forms of complex antimicrobial resistance.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Polymyxins are last-resort antibiotics used to treat highly resistant Gram-negative bacteria. There are increasing reports of polymyxin resistance emerging, raising concerns of a postantibiotic era. Polymyxin resistance is therefore a significant public health threat, but current phenotypic methods for detection are difficult and time-consuming to perform. There have been increasing efforts to use whole-genome sequencing for detection of antibiotic resistance, but this has been difficult to apply to polymyxin resistance because of its complex polygenic nature. The significance of our research is that we successfully applied machine learning methods to predict polymyxin resistance in <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> clonal group 258, a common health care-associated and multidrug-resistant pathogen. Our findings highlight that machine learning can be successfully applied even in complex forms of antibiotic resistance and represent a significant contribution to the literature that could be used to predict resistance in other bacteria and to other antibiotics.","Macesic, Bear Don't Walk, Pe'er, Tatonetti, Peleg, Uhlemann","https://doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.00656-19","20200928","antimicrobial resistance; genotype; machine learning; phenotype; prediction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16768,""
"Should free-text data in electronic medical records be shared for research? A citizens' jury study in the UK","Use of routinely collected patient data for research and service planning is an explicit policy of the UK National Health Service and UK government. Much clinical information is recorded in free-text letters, reports and notes. These text data are generally lost to research, due to the increased privacy risk compared with structured data. We conducted a citizens' jury which asked members of the public whether their medical free-text data should be shared for research for public benefit, to inform an ethical policy. Eighteen citizens took part over 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. Jurors heard a range of expert presentations as well as arguments for and against sharing free text, and then questioned presenters and deliberated together. They answered a questionnaire on whether and how free text should be shared for research, gave reasons for and against sharing and suggestions for alleviating their concerns. Jurors were in favour of sharing medical data and agreed this would benefit health research, but were more cautious about sharing free-text than structured data. They preferred processing of free text where a computer extracted information at scale. Their concerns were lack of transparency in uses of data, and privacy risks. They suggested keeping patients informed about uses of their data, and giving clear pathways to opt out of data sharing. Informed citizens suggested a transparent culture of research for the public benefit, and continuous improvement of technology to protect patient privacy, to mitigate their concerns regarding privacy risks of using patient text data.","Ford, Oswald, Hassan, Bozentko, Nenadic, Cassell","https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2019-105472","20200616","healthcare; medical text; natural language processing; privacy; stakeholder participation; text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16769,""
"Vertical lossless genomic data compression tools for assembled genomes: A systematic literature review","The recent decrease in cost and time to sequence and assemble of complete genomes created an increased demand for data storage. As a consequence, several strategies for assembled biological data compression were created. Vertical compression tools implement strategies that take advantage of the high level of similarity between multiple assembled genomic sequences for better compression results. However, current reviews on vertical compression do not compare the execution flow of each tool, which is constituted by phases of preprocessing, transformation, and data encoding. We performed a systematic literature review to identify and compare existing tools for vertical compression of assembled genomic sequences. The review was centered on PubMed and Scopus, in which 45726 distinct papers were considered. Next, 32 papers were selected according to the following criteria: to present a lossless vertical compression tool; to use the information contained in other sequences for the compression; to be able to manipulate genomic sequences in FASTA format; and no need prior knowledge. Although we extracted performance compression results, they were not compared as the tools did not use a standardized evaluation protocol. Thus, we conclude that there's a lack of definition of an evaluation protocol that must be applied by each tool.","Kredens, Martins, Dordal, Ferrandin, Herai, Scalabrin, ÃƒÂvila","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232942","20200731","Algorithms; Data Compression; Genome; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Publications; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16770,""
"Role of biological Data Mining and Machine Learning Techniques in Detecting and Diagnosing the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): A Systematic Review","Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that are common in many animal species, including camels, cattle, cats and bats. Animal CoVs, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and the new virus named SARS-CoV-2, rarely infect and spread among humans. On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak of the resulting disease from this new CoV called 'COVID-19', as a 'public health emergency of international concern'. This global pandemic has affected almost the whole planet and caused the death of more than 315,131 patients as of the date of this article. In this context, publishers, journals and researchers are urged to research different domains and stop the spread of this deadly virus. The increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications has addressed several medical problems. However, such applications remain insufficient given the high potential threat posed by this virus to global public health. This systematic review addresses automated AI applications based on data mining and machine learning (ML) algorithms for detecting and diagnosing COVID-19. We aimed to obtain an overview of this critical virus, address the limitations of utilising data mining and ML algorithms, and provide the health sector with the benefits of this technique. We used five databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus and performed three sequences of search queries between 2010 and 2020. Accurate exclusion criteria and selection strategy were applied to screen the obtained 1305 articles. Only eight articles were fully evaluated and included in this review, and this number only emphasised the insufficiency of research in this important area. After analysing all included studies, the results were distributed following the year of publication and the commonly used data mining and ML algorithms. The results found in all papers were discussed to find the gaps in all reviewed papers. Characteristics, such as motivations, challenges, limitations, recommendations, case studies, and features and classes used, were analysed in detail. This study reviewed the state-of-the-art techniques for CoV prediction algorithms based on data mining and ML assessment. The reliability and acceptability of extracted information and datasets from implemented technologies in the literature were considered. Findings showed that researchers must proceed with insights they gain, focus on identifying solutions for CoV problems, and introduce new improvements. The growing emphasis on data mining and ML techniques in medical fields can provide the right environment for change and improvement.","Albahri, Hamid, Alwan, Al-Qays, Zaidan, Zaidan, Albahri, AlAmoodi, Khlaf, Almahdi, Thabet, Hadi, Mohammed, Alsalem, Al-Obaidi, Madhloom","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-020-01582-x","20200604","Artificial Intelligence; Biological Data Mining; COVID-19; Coronaviruses; MERS-CoV; Machine Learning; SARS-CoV-2; Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Data Mining; Humans; Machine Learning; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16771,""
"Taking stock of what is known about faculty development in competency-based medical education: A scoping review paper","<b>Purpose:</b> The primary objective was to inventory what is currently known about faculty development (FD) for competency-based medical educations (CBME) and identify gaps in the literature.<b>Methods:</b> A scoping review methodology was employed. Inclusion criteria for article selection were established with two reviewers completing a full-text analysis. Quality checks were included, along with iterative consultation on data collection and consensus decision making via a grounded theory approach.<b>Results:</b> The review identified 19 articles published between 2009 and 2018. Most articles (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15) offered suggestions as to what should happen with FD in CBME, but few (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4) adopted an experimental design. Six main themes were identified with three main features of FD noted across themes: (1) The importance of direct and timely feedback to faculty members on their teaching and assessment skills.

"An artificial intelligence approach to COVID-19 infection risk assessment in virtual visits: A case report","In an effort to improve the efficiency of computer algorithms applied to screening for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing, we used natural language processing and artificial intelligence-based methods with unstructured patient data collected through telehealth visits. After segmenting and parsing documents, we conducted analysis of overrepresented words in patient symptoms. We then developed a word embedding-based convolutional neural network for predicting COVID-19 test results based on patients' self-reported symptoms. Text analytics revealed that concepts such as smell and taste were more prevalent than expected in patients testing positive. As a result, screening algorithms were adapted to include these symptoms. The deep learning model yielded an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.729 for predicting positive results and was subsequently applied to prioritize testing appointment scheduling. Informatics tools such as natural language processing and artificial intelligence methods can have significant clinical impacts when applied to data streams early in the development of clinical systems for outbreak response.","Obeid, Davis, Turner, Meystre, Heider, O'Bryan, Lenert","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa105","20201002","AI; COVID-19; artificial intelligence; risk assessment; text analytics; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Neural Networks, Computer; Organizational Case Studies; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; ROC Curve; Risk Assessment; South Carolina; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16773,""
"Pathology features and the results of treatment of two cases of posterior choroidal leiomyoma","Posterior choroidal leiomyoma is an extremely rare tumor, to our knowledge, less than 10 cases reported in the literature. The definite diagnosis can be confirmed by immunohistochemistry, and local resection is preferable to enucleation for the posterior choroidal leiomyoma. Two adult Asian women presented with progressive vision loss in their right eyes. Ophthalmic examination revealed an amelanotic dome-shaped choroidal mass located in the fundus with yellowish exudative retinal detachment. Clinical differential diagnosis of a nonpigmented choroidal neoplasm mainly includes amelanotic melanoma, atypical hemangioma, metastatic carcinoma, as well as the rare posterior choroidal leiomyoma. Considering the choroidal lesion was more likely to be a benign tumor, then we performed the treatment of local resection by pars plana vitrectomy and the histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of choroidal leiomyoma. The best corrected visual acuity of the patients was more than 20/100 on 6-month follow-up. From these two posterior choroidal neoplasm cases, we were able to demonstrate local resection by the 23 to 25-gauge mircoinvasive vitrectomy for excision of intraocular tumors is a feasible treatment for choroidal leiomyoma.","Zhou, Wei, Xu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12886-020-01445-6","20200602","Case report; Local resection; Microinvasive vitrectomy; Pathology features; Posterior choroidal leiomyoma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16774,""
"Text mining in a literature review of urothelial cancer using topic model","Urothelial cancer (UC) includes carcinomas of the bladder, ureters, and renal pelvis. New treatments and biomarkers of UC emerged in this decade. To identify the key information in a vast amount of literature can be challenging. In this study, we use text mining to explore UC publications to identify important information that may lead to new research directions. We used topic modeling to analyze the titles and abstracts of 29,883 articles of UC from Pubmed, Web of Science, and Embase in Mar 2020. We applied latent Dirichlet allocation modeling to extract 15 topics and conducted trend analysis. Gene ontology term enrichment analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis were performed to identify UC related pathways. There was a growing trend regarding UC treatment especially immune checkpoint therapy but not the staging of UC. The risk factors of UC carried in different countries such as cigarette smoking in the United State and aristolochic acid in Taiwan and China. GMCSF, IL-5, Syndecan-1, ErbB receptor, integrin, c-Met, and TRAIL signaling pathways are the most relevant biological pathway associated with UC. The risk factors of UC may be dependent on the countries and GMCSF, IL-5, Syndecan-1, ErbB receptor, integrin, c-Met, and TRAIL signaling pathways are the most relevant biological pathway associated with UC. These findings may provide further UC research directions.","Lin, Sheu, Tsai, Wang, Chou","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-020-06931-0","20200602","LDA2vec; Research trends; Text mining; Topic modeling; Urothelial carcinoma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16775,""
"Advancing evidence-based healthcare facility design: a systematic literature review","Healthcare facility design is a complex process that brings together diverse stakeholders and ideally aligns operational, environmental, experiential, clinical, and organizational objectives. The challenges inherent in facility design arise from the dynamic and complex nature of healthcare itself, and the growing accountability to the quadruple aims of enhancing patient experience, improving population health, reducing costs, and improving staff work life. Many healthcare systems and design practitioners are adopting an evidence-based approach to facility design, defined broadly as basing decisions about the built environment on credible and rigorous research and linking facility design to quality outcomes. Studies focused on architectural options and concepts in the evidence-based design literature have largely employed observation, surveys, post-occupancy study, space syntax analysis, or have been retrospective in nature. Fewer studies have explored layout optimization frameworks, healthcare layout modeling, applications of artificial intelligence, and layout robustness. These operations research/operations management approaches are highly valuable methods to inform healthcare facility design process in its earliest stages and measure performance in quantitative terms, yet they are currently underutilized. A primary objective of this paper is to begin to bridge this gap. This systematic review summarizes 65 evidence-based research studies related to facility layout and planning concepts published from 2008 through 2018, and categorizes them by methodology, area of focus, typology, and metrics of interest. The review identifies gaps in the existing literature and proposes solutions to advance evidence-based healthcare facility design. This work is the first of its kind to review the facility design literature across the disciplines of evidence-based healthcare design research, healthcare systems engineering, and operations research/operations management. The review suggests areas for future study that will enhance evidence-based healthcare facility designs through the integration of operations research and management science methods.","Halawa, Madathil, Gittler, Khasawneh","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10729-020-09506-4","20200803","Evidence-based design; Facility layout; Layout optimization; Literature review; Operations research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16776,""
"WCE polyp detection based on novel feature descriptor with normalized variance locality-constrained linear coding","Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has become an effective facility to detect digestive tract diseases. To further improve the accuracy and efficiency of computer-aided diagnosis system in the detection of intestine polyps, a novel algorithm is proposed for WCE polyp detection in this paper. First, by considering the rich color information of endoscopic images, a novel local color texture feature called histogram of local color difference (LCDH) is proposed for describing endoscopic images. A codebook acquisition method which is based upon positive samples is also proposed, generating more balanced visual words with the LCDH features. Furthermore, based on locality-constrained linear coding (LLC) algorithm, a normalized variance regular term is introduced as NVLLC algorithm, which considers the dispersion degree between k nearest visual words and features in the approximate coding phase. The final image representations are obtained from using the spatial matching pyramid model. Finally, the support vector machine is employed to classify the polyp images. The WCE dataset including 500 polyp and 500 normal images is adopted for evaluating the proposed method. Experimental results indicate that the classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity have reached 96.00%, 95.80% and 96.20%, which performances better than traditional ways. A novel method for WCE polyp detection is developed using LCDH feature descriptor and NVLLC coding scheme, which achieves a promising performance and can be implemented in clinical-assisted diagnosis of intestinal diseases.","Yang, Chang, Li, He, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02190-3","20200713","CAD; Feature coding; LCDH; Normalized variance; Polyp detection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16777,""
"Interventions improving health professionals' practice for addressing patients' weight management behaviours: systematic review of reviews","Health professionals require education and training to implement obesity management guidelines and ultimately impact on the health outcomes experienced by their patients. Therefore, a systematic review of systematic reviews that evaluated interventions designed to change the practice of health professionals when addressing diet and physical activity with their patients was conducted. MEDLINE Complete; Cochrane database of systematic reviews; PsycINFO; CINAHL Complete; Global Health; Embase; INFORMIT: Health Subset; Health System Evidence and RX for change were searched in March 2019, with no date or language limits. Identified references underwent screening, full-text analyses and data extraction in duplicate. The search identified 15Ã‚Â 230 references. Five systematic reviews that provided a narrative syntheses of a combined 38 studies were included. Health professional participants generally reported being satisfied with the training interventions. Heterogeneity between and within included reviews, non-controlled designs of individual studies and low quality of evidence at an individual study level and review level made it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding what interventions are most effective in changing health professionals' knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, attitudes and practice. However, similar gaps in the literature were identified across included reviews. Key areas that could be addressed in future interventions including organization and system-level barriers to providing advice, health professionals' attitudes and motivation and weight stigma have been highlighted. Health professionals and patients could be more involved in the planning and development of interventions that work towards improving diet and physical activity advice and support provided in healthcare.","Yazdizadeh, Walker, Skouteris, Olander, Hill","https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daaa039","20200524","diet; health professionals; physical activity; practice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16778,""
"Challenges of Developing a Natural Language Processing Method With Electronic Health Records to Identify Persons With Chronic Mobility Disability","To assess the utility of applying natural language processing (NLP) to electronic health records (EHRs) to identify individuals with chronic mobility disability. We used EHRs from the Research Patient Data Repository, which contains EHRs from a large Massachusetts health care delivery system. This analysis was part of a larger study assessing the effects of disability on diagnosis of colorectal cancer. We applied NLP text extraction software to longitudinal EHRs of colorectal cancer patients to identify persons who use a wheelchair (our indicator of mobility disability for this analysis). We manually reviewed the clinical notes identified by NLP using directed content analysis to identify true cases using wheelchairs, duration or chronicity of use, and documentation quality. EHRs from large health care delivery system PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=14,877) 21-75 years old who were newly diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2005 andÃ‚Â 2017. Not applicable. Confirmation of patients' chronic wheelchair use in NLP-flagged notes; quality of disability documentation. We identified 14,877 patients with colorectal cancer with 303,182 associated clinical notes. NLP screening identified 1482 (0.5%) notes that contained 1+ wheelchair-associated keyword. These notes were associated with 420 patients (2.8% of colorectal cancer population). Of the 1482 notes, 286 (19.3%, representing 105 patients, 0.7% of the total) contained documentation of reason for wheelchair use and duration. Directed content analysis identified 3 themes concerning disability documentation: (1) wheelchair keywords used in specific EHR contexts; (2) reason for wheelchair not clearly stated; and (3) duration of wheelchair use not consistently documented. NLP offers an option to screen for patients with chronic mobility disability in much less time than required by manual chart review. Nonetheless, manual chart review must confirm that flagged patients have chronic mobility disability (are not false positives). Notes, however, often have inadequate disability documentation.","Agaronnik, Lindvall, El-Jawahri, He, Iezzoni","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2020.04.024","20201003","Electronic health records; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16779,""
"Influence of Demographic Factors on the Prevalence of a Second Root Canal in Mandibular Anterior Teeth - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cross-Sectional Studies Using Cone Beam Computed Tomography","The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the influence of population demographic characteristics on the prevalence of a second canal in mandibular anterior teeth. Four electronic databases and five peer-reviewed journals were searched from May 2018 to September 2019 for prevalence studies using cone-beam computed tomographic imaging on second canal morphology in mandibular anterior teeth. The identified studies were subjected to a hand search of bibliographic references followed by contact with the authors. Full text analysis and critical appraisal (JBI) was undertaken on 40 papers by 2 evaluators. Sixteen studies were included into a meta-analysis. Forest plots with proportion and odds ratios with a 95% confidence interval were calculated. Meta-regression was performed in order to identify possible sources of heterogeneity. The 16 selected studies presented an average JBI score of 77.7% and revealed data from 40,784 mandibular anterior teeth (14,278 central incisors, 14,433 lateral incisors, and 12,073 canines). The overall prevalence of a second canal for central incisors, lateral incisors and canines was 20.4% (15.0%-25.7% CI 95%), 25.3% (20.0%-30.7% CI 95%) and 5.9% (4.1%-7.7% CI 95%), respectively. Males showed significantly higher odds of having a second canal for both incisors (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.05). East Asia studies presented lower proportions of a second canal in mandibular anterior teeth (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.05). The overall prevalence of a second canal in the mandibular central and lateral incisors and canines was 20.4%, 25.3% and 5.9%, respectively.

"Using artificial intelligence algorithms to identify existing knowledge within the back pain literature","Artificial intelligence algorithms can now identify hidden data patterns within the scientific literature. In 2019, these algorithms identified a thermoelectric material within the pre-2009 chemistry literature; years before its discovery in 2012. This approach inspired us to apply this algorithm to the back pain literature as the cause of back pain remains unknown in 90% of cases. We created a subset of all PubMed abstracts containing &quot;back&quot; and &quot;pain&quot; and then trained the Word2vec algorithm to predict word proximity. We then identified word pairings having high vector proximities between three spinal domains: anatomy, pathology and treatment. We plotted both between-domain and within-domain proximities then used the highest proximity pairs as ground truths in analogy testing to identify known associations (e.g., Canal is to Stenosis as Multifidus is to ?) RESULTS: We found Ã‚Â 50,038 abstracts resulting in 27,984 unique wordsÃ‚Â and 108,252 instances of &quot;backÃ‚Â pain&quot;. Ground truth pairings ranged in proximity from 0.86 to 0.70. Plotting revealed unique proximity representations between the three spine domains. From analogy testing, we identified 13 known word associations (pars_interarticularis is to stress_reaction as nerve_root is to compression). Artificial intelligence algorithms can successfully extract complex concepts from back pain literature. While use of AI algorithms to discover potentially unknown word associations requires future validation, our results provide investigators with a novel tool to generate new hypotheses regarding the origins of LBP and other spine related topics. To encourage use of these tools, we have created a free web-based app for investigator-driven queries.","Kawchuk, Guan, Keen, Hauer, Kondrak","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00586-020-06447-y","20200805","Artificial intelligence; Low back pain; Word2vec","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16781,""
"The cost-effectiveness of using results-based financing to reduce maternal and perinatal mortality in Malawi","Results-based financing (RBF) is being promoted to increase coverage and quality of maternal and perinatal healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries. Evidence on the cost-effectiveness of RBF is limited. We assessed the cost-effectiveness within the context of an RBF intervention, including performance-based financing and conditional cash transfers, in rural Malawi. We used a decision tree model to estimate expected costs and effects of RBF compared with status quo care during single pregnancy episodes. RBF effects on maternal case fatality rates were modelled based on data from a maternal and perinatal programme evaluation in Zambia and Uganda. We obtained complementary epidemiological information from the published literature. Service utilisation rates for normal and complicated deliveries and associated costs of care were based on the RBF intervention in Malawi. Costs were estimated from a societal perspective. We estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted, death averted and life-year gained (LYG) and conducted sensitivity analyses to how robust results were to variations in key model parameters. Relative to status quo, RBF implied incremental costs of US$1122, US$26Ã¢â‚¬â€°220 and US$987 per additional DALY averted, death averted and LYG, respectively. The share of non-RBF facilities that provide quality care, life expectancy of mothers at time of delivery and the share of births in non-RBF facilities strongly influenced cost-effectiveness values. At a willingness to pay of US$1485 (3 times Malawi gross domestic product per capita) per DALY averted, RBF has a 77% probability of being cost-effective. At high thresholds of wiliness-to-pay, RBF is a cost-effective intervention to improve quality of maternal and perinatal healthcare and outcomes, compared with the non-RBF based approach. More RBF cost-effectiveness analyses are needed in the SSA region to complement the few published studies and narrow the uncertainties surrounding cost-effectiveness estimates.","Chinkhumba, De Allegri, Brenner, Muula, Robberstad","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2019-002260","20200604","child health; health economics; maternal health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16782,""

High-resolution ultrasound has recently emerged as an unparalleled diagnostic tool for diagnosing postganglionic lesions of the BP. Existing literature describes the technical skills needed for prompt ultrasound imaging and guided injections for the BP.

"Infant FreeSurfer: An automated segmentation and surface extraction pipeline for T1-weighted neuroimaging data of infants 0-2 years","The development of automated tools for brain morphometric analysis in infants has lagged significantly behind analogous tools for adults. This gap reflects the greater challenges in this domain due to: 1) a smaller-scaled region of interest, 2) increased motion corruption, 3) regional changes in geometry due to heterochronous growth, and 4) regional variations in contrast properties corresponding to ongoing myelination and other maturation processes. Nevertheless, there is a great need for automated image-processing tools to quantify differences between infant groups and other individuals, because aberrant cortical morphologic measurements (including volume, thickness, surface area, and curvature) have been associated with neuropsychiatric, neurologic, and developmental disorders in children. In this paper we present an automated segmentation and surface extraction pipeline designed to accommodate clinical MRI studies of infant brains in a population 0-2 year-olds. The algorithm relies on a single channel of T1-weighted MR images to achieve automated segmentation of cortical and subcortical brain areas, producing volumes of subcortical structures and surface models of the cerebral cortex. We evaluated the algorithm both qualitatively and quantitatively using manually labeled datasets, relevant comparator software solutions cited in the literature, and expert evaluations. The computational tools and atlases described in this paper will be distributed to the research community as part of the FreeSurfer image analysis package.","ZÃƒÂ¶llei, Iglesias, Ou, Grant, Fischl","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116946","20201027","Brain surface; FreeSurfer; Infant; MRI; Segmentation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16784,""
"Technical Metrics Used to Evaluate Health Care Chatbots: Scoping Review","Dialog agents (chatbots) have a long history of application in health care, where they have been used for tasks such as supporting patient self-management and providing counseling. Their use is expected to grow with increasing demands on health systems and improving artificial intelligence (AI) capability. Approaches to the evaluation of health care chatbots, however, appear to be diverse and haphazard, resulting in a potential barrier to the advancement of the field. This study aims to identify the technical (nonclinical) metrics used by previous studies to evaluate health care chatbots. Studies were identified by searching 7 bibliographic databases (eg, MEDLINE and PsycINFO) in addition to conducting backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. The studies were independently selected by two reviewers who then extracted data from the included studies. Extracted data were synthesized narratively by grouping the identified metrics into categories based on the aspect of chatbots that the metrics evaluated. Of the 1498 citations retrieved, 65 studies were included in this review. Chatbots were evaluated using 27 technical metrics, which were related to chatbots as a whole (eg, usability, classifier performance, speed), response generation (eg, comprehensibility, realism, repetitiveness), response understanding (eg, chatbot understanding as assessed by users, word error rate, concept error rate), and esthetics (eg, appearance of the virtual agent, background color, and content). The technical metrics of health chatbot studies were diverse, with survey designs and global usability metrics dominating. The lack of standardization and paucity of objective measures make it difficult to compare the performance of health chatbots and could inhibit advancement of the field. We suggest that researchers more frequently include metrics computed from conversation logs. In addition, we recommend the development of a framework of technical metrics with recommendations for specific circumstances for their inclusion in chatbot studies.","Abd-Alrazaq, Safi, Alajlani, Warren, Househ, Denecke","https://doi.org/10.2196/18301","20201020","chatbots; conversational agents; evaluation; health care; metrics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16785,""
"Use of Decision Analysis and Economic Evaluation in Breast Reconstruction: A Systematic Review","Decision analysis allows clinicians to compare different strategies in the context of uncertainty, through explicit and quantitative measures such as quality of life outcomes and costing data. This is especially important in breast reconstruction, where multiple strategies can be offered to patients. This systematic review aims to appraise and review the different decision analytic models used in breast reconstruction. A search of English articles in PubMed, Ovid, and Embase databases was performed. All articles regardless of date of publishing were considered. Two reviewers independently assessed each article, based on strict inclusion criteria. Out of 442 articles identified, 27 fit within the inclusion criteria. These were then grouped according to aspects of breast reconstruction, with implant-based reconstruction (n = 13) being the most commonly reported. Decision analysis (n = 19) and/or economic analyses (n = 27) were employed to discuss reconstructive options. The most common outcome was cost (n = 27). The decision analysis models compared and contrasted surgical strategies, management options, and novel adjuncts. Decision analysis in breast reconstruction is growing exponentially.The most common model used was a simple decision tree. Models published were of high quality but could be improved with a more in-depth sensitivity analysis. It is essential for surgeons to familiarize themselves with the concept of decision analysis to better tackle complicated decisions, due to its intrinsic advantage of being able to weigh risks and benefits of multiple strategies while using probabilistic models.","Bouhadana, Safran, Al-Halabi, Davison","https://doi.org/10.1097/GOX.0000000000002786","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16786,""
"Predicting treatment effects in unipolar depression: A meta-review","There is increasing interest in clinical prediction models in psychiatry, which focus on developing multivariate algorithms to guide personalized diagnostic or management decisions. The main target of these models is the prediction of treatment response to different antidepressant therapies. This is because the ability to predict response based on patients' personal data may allow clinicians to make improved treatment decisions, and to provide more efficacious or more tolerable medications to the right patient. We searched the literature for systematic reviews about treatment prediction in the context of existing treatment modalities for adult unipolar depression, until July 2019. Treatment effect is defined broadly to include efficacy, safety, tolerability and acceptability outcomes. We first focused on the identification of individual predictor variables that might predict treatment response, and second, we considered multivariate clinical prediction models. Our meta-review included a total of 10 systematic reviews; seven (from 2014 to 2018) focusing on individual predictor variables and three focusing on clinical prediction models. These identified a number of sociodemographic, phenomenological, clinical, neuroimaging, remote monitoring, genetic and serum marker variables as possible predictor variables for treatment response, alongside statistical and machine-learning approaches to clinical prediction model development. Effect sizes for individual predictor variables were generally small and clinical prediction models had generally not been validated in external populations. There is a need for rigorous model validation in large external data-sets to prove the clinical utility of models. We also discuss potential future avenues in the field of personalized psychiatry, particularly the combination of multiple sources of data and the emerging field of artificial intelligence and digital mental health to identify new individual predictor variables.","Gillett, Tomlinson, Efthimiou, Cipriani","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2020.107557","20200821","Antidepressant drugs; Clinical prediction model; Personalized medicine; Precision psychiatry; Prediction; Treatment response; Unipolar depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16787,""
"An interim internal Threshold of Toxicologic Concern (iTTC) for chemicals in consumer products, with support from an automated assessment of ToxCastÃ¢â€žÂ¢ dose response data","Additional non-animal methods are urgently needed to meet regulatory and animal welfare goals. TTC is a broadly used risk assessment tool. TTC based on external dose has limited utility for multi-route exposure and some types of structure activity relationship assessments. An internal TTC (iTTC), where thresholds are based on blood concentration, would extend the applicability of TTC. While work is on-going to develop robust iTTC thresholds, we propose an interim conservative iTTC. Specifically, an interim iTTC of 1Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼M, supported by the published experience of the pharmaceutical industry, a literature review of non-drug chemical/receptor interactions, and analysis of ToxCastÃ¢â€žÂ¢ data. ToxCastÃ¢â€žÂ¢ data were used to explore activity versus the 1Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼M interim iTTC and recommendations for the analysis and interpretation of HTS data. Test concentration-based points of departure were classified to identify quality of fit to the Hill Model. We identified, for exclusion from the approach, estrogen receptor and androgen receptor targets as potent chemical/receptor interactions potentially associated with low dose exposure to non-pharmaceutical active ingredients in addition to the original TTC exclusions. With these exclusions, we conclude that a 1Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼M plasma concentration is unlikely to be associated with significant biological effects from chemicals not intentionally designed for biological activity.","Blackburn, Carr, Rose, Selman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2020.104656","20200612","High throughput screening data analysis; Risk assessment; SAR; Structure activity relationships; TTC; Threshold of toxicological concern; ToxCast","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16788,""
"Generation and evaluation of artificial mental health records for Natural Language Processing","A serious obstacle to the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods in the clinical domain is the accessibility of textual data.

This problem could be tackled by using artificial medical data. In this work, we present an approach to generate artificial clinical documents. We apply this approach to discharge summaries from a large mental healthcare provider and discharge summaries from an intensive care unit. We perform an extensive intrinsic evaluation where we (1) apply several measures of text preservation; (2) measure how much the model memorises training data; and (3) estimate clinical validity of the generated text based on a human evaluation task. Furthermore, we perform an extrinsic evaluation by studying the impact of using artificial text in a downstream NLP text classification task. We found that using this artificial data as training data can lead to classification results that are comparable to the original results. Additionally, using only a small amount of information from the original data to condition the generation of the artificial data is successful, which holds promise for reducing the risk of these artificial data retaining rare information from the original data. This is an important finding for our long-term goal of being able to generate artificial clinical data that can be released to the wider research community and accelerate advances in developing computational methods that use healthcare data.","Ive, Viani, Kam, Yin, Verma, Puntis, Cardinal, Roberts, Stewart, Velupillai","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-020-0267-x","20200928","Medical research; Scientific community","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16789,""
"The Role of Engagement in Teleneurorehabilitation: A Systematic Review","The growing understanding of the importance of involving patients with neurological diseases in their healthcare routine either for at-home management of their chronic conditions or after the hospitalization period has opened the research for new rehabilitation strategies to enhance patient engagement in neurorehabilitation. In addition, the use of new digital technologies in the neurorehabilitation field enables the implementation of telerehabilitation systems such as virtual reality interventions, video games, web-based interventions, mobile applications, web-based or telephonic telecoach programs, in order to facilitate the relationship between clinicians and patients, and to motivate and activate patients to continue with the rehabilitation process at home. Here we present a systematic review that aims at reviewing the effectiveness of different engagement strategies and the different engagement assessments while using telerehabilitation systems in patients with neurological disorders. We used PICO's format to define the question of the review, and the systematic review protocol was designed following the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Bibliographical data was collected by using the following bibliographic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science. Eighteen studies were included in this systematic review for full-text analyses. Overall, the reviewed studies using engagement strategies through telerehabilitation systems in patients with neurological disorders were mainly focused on patient self-management and self-awareness, patient motivation, and patient adherence subcomponents of engagement, that are involved in by the behavioral, cognitive, and emotional dimensions of engagement. Conclusion: The studies commented throughout this systematic review pave the way for the design of new telerehabilitation protocols, not only focusing on measuring quantitative or qualitative measures but measuring both of them through a mixed model intervention design (1). The future clinical studies with a mixed model design will provide more abundant data regarding the role of engagement in telerehabilitation, leading to a possibly greater understanding of its underlying components.","Matamala-Gomez, Maisto, Montana, Mavrodiev, Baglio, Rossetto, Mantovani, Riva, Realdon","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00354","20200928","digital technologies; engagement; patient activation; self-management; teleneurorehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16790,""
"Automation of in-hospital pharmacy dispensing: a systematic review","The current systematic review (SR) was undertaken to identify and summarise the published literature reporting on the clinical and economic value of automated in-hospital pharmacy services with a primary focus on systems supporting the dispensing of medicines. Literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library on 17 December 2017 to identify English-language publications investigating any automated dispensing systems (ADSs) in the inpatient setting to include central pharmacy and ward-based systems. 4320 publications were screened by title and abstract and 45 of 175 full publications screened were included. Grey literature searching identified an additional three publications. Therefore, 48 publications relating to ADSs were eligible for inclusion. Although a relatively large evidence base was identified as part of the current SR, the eligible studies were inconsistent in terms of their design and the format of reporting of outcomes. The studies demonstrate that both pharmacy and ward-based ADSs offer benefits over traditional manual dispensing methods in terms of clinical and economic outcomes. The primary benefits following implementation of an ADS include reductions in medication errors, medication administration time and costs. Studies examining optimisation/inventory management strategies/refill programmes for these systems suggest that optimal implementation of the ADS is required to ensure that clinical success and economic benefits are maximised. The published evidence suggests positive impacts of ADS and should encourage hospitals to invest in automation, with a global strategy to improve the reliability and the efficiency of the medication process. However, one of the key findings of the current SR is the need for further data from adequately powered studies reporting clinically relevant outcomes which would allow for robust, evidence-based recommendations on the return on investment of the technologies. These studies would probably contribute to a larger adoption of these technologies by European hospitals.","Batson, Herranz, Rohrbach, Canobbio, Mitchell, Bonnabry","https://doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2019-002081","20200521","clinical pharmacy; dispensing forms; dispensing robots; hospital pharmacy automation; uni dose system","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16791,""
"A genome-wide association study of interhemispheric theta EEG coherence: implications for neural connectivity and alcohol use behavior","Aberrant connectivity of large-scale brain networks has been observed among individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) as well as in those at risk, suggesting deficits in neural communication between brain regions in the liability to develop AUD. Electroencephalographical (EEG) coherence, which measures the degree of synchrony between brain regions, may be a useful measure of connectivity patterns in neural networks for studying the genetics of AUD. In 8810 individuals (6644 of European and 2166 of African ancestry) from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), we performed a Multi-Trait Analyses of genome-wide association studies (MTAG) on parietal resting-state theta (3-7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Hz) EEG coherence, which previously have been associated with AUD. We also examined developmental effects of GWAS findings on trajectories of neural connectivity in a longitudinal subsample of 2316 adolescent/young adult offspring from COGA families (ages 12-30) and examined the functional and clinical significance of GWAS variants. Six correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms located in a brain-expressed lincRNA (ENSG00000266213) on chromosome 18q23 were associated with posterior interhemispheric low theta EEG coherence (3-5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Hz). These same variants were also associated with alcohol use behavior and posterior corpus callosum volume, both in a subset of COGA and in the UK Biobank. Analyses in the subsample of COGA offspring indicated that the association of rs12954372 with low theta EEG coherence occurred only in females, most prominently between ages 25 and 30 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°10<sup>-9</sup>). Converging data provide support for the role of genetic variants on chromosome 18q23 in regulating neural connectivity and alcohol use behavior, potentially via dysregulated myelination. While findings were less robust, genome-wide associations were also observed with rs151174000 and parieto-frontal low theta coherence, rs14429078 and parieto-occipital interhemispheric high theta coherence, and rs116445911 with centro-parietal low theta coherence. These novel genetic findings highlight the utility of the endophenotype approach in enhancing our understanding of mechanisms underlying addiction susceptibility.","Meyers, Zhang, Chorlian, Pandey, Kamarajan, Wang, Wetherill, Lai, Chao, Chan, Kinreich, Kapoor, Bertelsen, McClintick, Bauer, Hesselbrock, Kuperman, Kramer, Salvatore, Dick, Agrawal, Foroud, Edenberg, Goate, Porjesz","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-0777-6","20200701","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16792,""
"An Automated Mobile Mood Tracking Technology (Mood 24/7): Validation Study","Electronic tracking has been utilized for a variety of health conditions. Previous studies have shown that there is higher adherence to electronic methods vs paper-and-pencil tracking modalities. Electronic tracking also ensures that there are no back-filled entries, where patients have-to appear compliant-entered their responses retrospectively just before their visits with their health care provider. On the basis of the recognition of an unmet need for a Web-based automated platform to track psychiatric outcomes, Johns Hopkins University partnered with Health Central (a subsidiary of Remedy Health Media LLC) to develop Mood 24/7, an electronic, mobile, automated, SMS-based mood tracker. This is a pilot study to validate the use of Mood 24/7 in anticipation of clinical trials to demonstrate the therapeutic benefit on patients' health outcomes of utilizing digital mood-tracking technology. Mood 24/7 is an electronic mood-monitoring platform developed to accurately and efficiently track mood over time through automated daily SMS texts or emails. This study was designed to assess the accuracy and validity of Mood 24/7 in an outpatient psychiatric setting. This pilot study involved a retrospective chart review for depressed outpatients (N=9) to compare their self-reported Mood 24/7 daily mood ratings with their psychiatrist's independent clinical mood assessment at the time of the patient's visit. Their mood ratings via Mood 24/7 were collected over 36 weeks. In addition, a mixed model analysis was applied to compare the weekly Montgomery-Ãƒâ€¦sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores with Mood 24/7 scores over an average of 3 months. A 97.2% (315/324) digital mood reporting adherence was found over 36 weeks, and a significant correlation (r=0.86, P&lt;.001) was observed between patients' Mood 24/7 scores and their psychiatrist's blinded clinical assessment of the patient's mood when seen in the clinic. In addition, a significant concordance (intraclass correlation of 0.69, 95% CI 0.33-0.91, P&lt;.001) was observed in the mixed model analysis of the clinician-administered MADRS vs Mood 24/7 scores over time. Our chart review and mixed model analyses demonstrate that Mood 24/7 is a valid instrument for convenient, simple, noninvasive, and accurate longitudinal mood assessment in the outpatient clinical setting.","Kumar, Wang, Riehm, Yu, Smith, Kaplin","https://doi.org/10.2196/16237","20200928","depression; digital health; ecological momentary assessment; mobile phone; patient monitoring; short message service; text messaging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16793,""
"Automated neurosurgical stereotactic planning for intraoperative use: a comprehensive review of the literature and perspectives","The creation of intracranial stereotactic trajectories, from entry point to target point, is still mostly done manually by the neurosurgeon. The development of automated stereotactic planning tools has been described in the literature. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of stereotactic planning procedure automation and develop tools for patients undergoing neurosurgical stereotactic procedures. PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from inception to September 1, 2019, at the exception of Google Scholar (from 1 January 2010 to September 1, 2019) in French and English. Eligible studies included all studies proposing automated stereotactic planning. A total of 1543 studies were screened. Forty-two studies were included in the systematic review, including 18 (42.9%) conference papers. The surgical procedures planned automatically were mainly deep brain stimulation (n = 14, 33.3%), stereoelectroencephalography (n = 12, 28.6%), and not specified (n = 10, 23.8%). The most frequently used surgical constraints to plan the trajectory were blood vessels (n = 32, 76.2%), cerebral sulci (n = 27, 64.3%), and cerebral ventricles (n = 23, 54.8%). The distance from blood vessels ranged from 1.96 to 4.78 mm for manual trajectories and from 2.47 to 7.0 mm for automated trajectories. At least one neurosurgeon was involved in 36 studies (85.7%). The automated stereotactic trajectory was preferred in 75.4% of the studied cases (range 30-92.9). Only 3 (7.1%) studies were multicentric. No study reported prospective use of the planning software.

"Identification of potentially undiagnosed patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease using machine learning applied to primary care data in the UK","Nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease (NTMLD) is a rare lung disease often missed due to a low index of suspicion and unspecific clinical presentation. This retrospective study was designed to characterise the prediagnosis features of NTMLD patients in primary care and to assess the feasibility of using machine learning to identify undiagnosed NTMLD patients.IQVIA Medical Research Data (incorporating THIN, a Cegedim Database), a UK electronic medical records primary care database was used. NTMLD patients were identified between 2003 and 2017 by diagnosis in primary or secondary care or record of NTMLD treatment regimen. Risk factors and treatments were extracted in the prediagnosis period, guided by literature and expert clinical opinion. The control population was enriched to have at least one of these features.741 NTMLD and 112Ã¢â‚¬Å 784 control patients were selected. Annual prevalence rates of NTMLD from 2006 to 2016 increased from 2.7 to 5.1 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Å 000.

"Enhancing SVM for survival data using local invariances and weighting","The necessity to analyze medium-throughput data in epidemiological studies with small sample size, particularly when studying biomedical data may hinder the use of classical statistical methods. Support vector machines (SVM) models can be successfully applied in this setting because they are a powerful tool to analyze data with large number of predictors and limited sample size, especially when handling binary outcomes. However, biomedical research often involves analysis of time-to-event outcomes and has to account for censoring. Methods to handle censored data in the SVM framework can be divided into two classes: those based on support vector regression (SVR) and those based on binary classification. Methods based on SVR seem to be suboptimal to handle sparse data and yield results comparable to Cox proportional hazards model and kernel Cox regression. The limited work dedicated to assess methods based on of SVM for binary classification has been based on SVM learning using privileged information and SVM with uncertain classes. This paper proposes alternative methods and extensions within the binary classification framework, specifically, a conditional survival approach for weighting censored observations and a semi-supervised SVM with local invariances. Using simulation studies and some real datasets, we evaluate those two methods and compare them with a weighted SVM model, SVM extensions found in the literature, kernel Cox regression and Cox model. Our proposed methods perform generally better under a wide variety of realistic scenarios about the structure of biomedical data. Specifically, the local invariances method using the conditional survival approach is the most robust method under different scenarios and is a good approach to consider as an alternative to other time-to-event methods. When analysing real data is a method to be considered and recommended since outperforms other methods in proportional and non-proportional scenarios and sparse data, which is something usual in biomedical data and biomarkers analysis.","Sanz, Reverter, Valim","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-3481-2","20200715","Classification; Kernel; Support vector machines; Survival analysis; Humans; Proportional Hazards Models; Support Vector Machine; Survival Analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16796,""
"Using machine learning techniques to develop risk prediction models to predict graft failure following kidney transplantation: protocol for a retrospective cohort study","<b>Background:</b> A mechanism to predict graft failure before the actual kidney transplantation occurs is crucial to clinical management of chronic kidney disease patients.Ã‚ Several kidney graft outcome prediction models, developed using machine learning methods, are available in the literature.Ã‚ However, most of those models used small datasets and none of the machine learning-based prediction models available in the medical literature modelled time-to-event (survival) information, but instead used the binary outcome of failure or not. The objective of this study is to develop two separate machine learning-based predictive models to predict graft failure following live and deceased donor kidney transplant, using time-to-event data in a large national dataset from Australia.Ã‚Â Ã‚ <b>Methods:</b> The dataset provided by the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry will be used for the analysis. This retrospective dataset contains the cohort of patients who underwent a kidney transplant in Australia from January 1 <sup>st</sup>, 2007, to December 31 <sup>st</sup>, 2017. This included 3,758 live donor transplants and 7,365 deceased donor transplants. Three machine learning methods (survival tree, random survival forest and survival support vector machine) and one traditional regression method, Cox proportional regression, will be used to develop the two predictive models (for live donor and deceased donor transplants). The best predictive model will be selected based on the model's performance. <b>Discussion:</b> This protocol describes the development of two separate machine learning-based predictive models to predict graft failure following live and deceased donor kidney transplant, using a large national dataset from Australia. Furthermore, these two models will be the most comprehensive kidney graft failure predictive models that have used survival data to model using machine learning techniques.

Such complex nonlinear processes are challenging to model, predict and optimize using conventional methods. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have gained momentum in offering alternative computational approaches to solve solid waste management (SWM) problems. AI has been efficient at tackling ill-defined problems, learning from experience, and handling uncertainty and incomplete data. Although significant research was carried out in this domain, very few review studies have assessed the potential of AI in solving the diverse SWM problems.

"Longitudinal assessment of carotid plaque texture in three-dimensional ultrasound images based on semi-supervised graph-based dimensionality reduction and feature selection","With continuous development of therapeutic options for atherosclerosis, image-based biomarkers sensitive to the effect of new interventions are required to be developed for cost-effective clinical evaluation. Although 3D ultrasound measurement of total plaque volume (TPV) showed the efficacy of high-dose statin, more sensitive biomarkers are needed to establish the efficacy of dietary supplements expected to confer a smaller beneficial effect. This study involved 171 subjects who participated in a one-year placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effect of pomegranate. A framework involving a feature selection technique known as discriminative feature selection (DFS) and a semi-supervised graph-based regression (SSGBR) technique was proposed for sensitive detection of plaque textural changes over the trial. 376 textual features of plaques were extracted from 3D ultrasound images acquired at baseline and a follow-up session. A scalar biomarker for each subject were generated by SSGBR based on prominent textural features selected by DFS. The ability of this biomarker for discriminating pomegranate from placebo subjects was quantified by the p-values obtained in Mann-Whitney U test. The discriminative power of SSGBR was compared with global and local dimensionality reduction techniques, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), maximum margin criterion (MMC) and Laplacian Eigenmap (LE). Only SSGBR (p=4.12Ãƒâ€”10<sup>-6</sup>) and normalized LE (p=0.002) detected a difference between the two groups at the 5% significance level. As compared with ÃŽâ€TPV, SSGBR reduced the sample size required to establish a significant difference by a factor of 60.

"Arsenic contamination assessment in Brazil - Past, present and future concerns: A historical and critical review","This paper presents a summary of some relevant documents published during the last decades regarding arsenic contamination in Brazil until December 2018, including scientific papers, reports and regulatory documents. Natural and anthropogenic arsenic sources were covered, excluding those related to agriculture. International &quot;key&quot; documents related to arsenic contamination were used to support the discussion and comparative analysis. This paper aims: (a) to summarize and discuss some available data (including Portuguese written documents) concerning arsenic contamination in Brazil, mainly geographical, geological, geochemical, environmental and health studies; (b) to critically review the published studies comparing their main findings; (c) to describe and compare ancient and recent contamination events; and (d) to highlight key knowledge gaps, and identify promising areas for future researches. The arsenic contamination scenario in Brazil results not only from mining. Natural or anthropogenic emissions caused by great magnitude phenomena as flooding, erosion, landslide and, water scarcity equally impact arsenic mobilization/immobilization equilibria. Our literature review demonstrates that arsenic contamination of soils, sediments and water sources is observed at least at three of the five geographically defined Brazilian regions (Northern, Southern and, Southeastern regions). Arsenic enriched soils, and waters naturally occur all around the country and anthropogenic activities have been the main contributory factor to the environmental contamination since the 18th Century. Geogenic materials (topsoil and mining tailings), and water samples could contain extremely high arsenic concentrations, i.e. 21,000Ã‚Â mgÃ‚Â kg<sup>-1</sup> or 1,700,000Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼gÃ‚Â L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, have been found mainly at the &quot;Iron Quadrangle&quot;. Moreover, if we consider both the Brazilian and international parameters, the health risks associated with the human exposition to arsenic are of significant concern. For those reasons, constant monitoring of As contaminated areas in Brazil is mandatory. Furthermore, it is necessary to learn from the mistakes made in the past in order to prevent or minimize future problems.","Teixeira, Santos, Fernandes, Ng","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138217","20200603","Bibliometric analysis; FundÃƒÂ£o Dam collapse; Iron Quadrangle; Mining wastes; Potentially toxic elements - PTE; Risk assessment; Arsenic; Brazil; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16800,""
"Supervised domain generalization for integration of disparate scalp EEG datasets for automatic epileptic seizure detection","Numerous automatic epileptic seizure detectors (ESDs) with excellent performances have been reported, but they generally experience performance degradation when tested with real-life clinical data. This has been blamed on the scarcity of high-quality training data, which leads to models that generalize poorly. There is consequently interest in methods to improve the quality and quantity of training data for ESDs. This study used a domain generalization approach to combine data from two different datasets for training an ESD, which was thereafter tested on a third dataset. A subspace of the CHB-MIT and TUSZ scalp EEG seizure datasets was extracted using transfer component analysis, based on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space approach. We then used the Azimuthal Equidistant Projection to transform 3D electrode coordinates into 2D space, followed by interpolation using the Clough-Tocher technique to generate 16x16 rasters. We thereafter generated feature vectors, each of which was a sequence of 17 ten-layer 16x16 raster arrays. The vectors were used to train a recurrent-convolutional neural network. The network had a 128-unit long short-term memory layer with inputs from 17 parallel networks each with three stacks of convolutional layers. Testing was based on a private 26-subject dataset, combined with randomly selected subsets of the CHB-MIT and TUSZ datasets. A combined sensitivity of 74.5% was achieved, along with a false positive per hour rate of 0.84, and a latency of 2.32 s. Detection sensitivity on the private dataset was 72.5%. These results compare favorably with results of large-scale validation studies in literature and confirm the viability of this approach to increasing the size of training datasets for ESDs.","Ayodele, Ikezogwo, Komolafe, Ogunbona","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103757","20200518","Epileptic seizure; Recurrent convolutional neural network; Supervised domain generalization; Transfer component analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16801,""
"A web-based automated machine learning platform to analyze liquid biopsy data","Liquid biopsy (LB) technologies continue to improve in sensitivity, specificity, and multiplexing and can measure an ever growing library of disease biomarkers. However, clinical interpretation of the increasingly large sets of data these technologies generate remains a challenge. Machine learning is a popular approach to discover and detect signatures of disease. However, limited machine learning expertise in the LB field has kept the discipline from fully leveraging these tools and risks improper analyses and irreproducible results. In this paper, we develop a web-based automated machine learning tool tailored specifically for LB, where machine learning models can be built without the user's input. We also incorporate a differential privacy algorithm, designed to limit the effects of overfitting that can arise from users iteratively developing a panel with feedback from our platform. We validate our approach by performing a meta-analysis on 11 published LB datasets, and found that we had similar or better performance compared to those reported in the literature. Moreover, we show that our platform's performance improved when incorporating information from prior LB datasets, suggesting that this approach can continue to improve with increased access to LB data. Finally, we show that by using our platform the results achieved in the literature can be matched using 40% of the number of subjects in the training set, potentially reducing study cost and time. This self-improving and overfitting-resistant automatic machine learning platform provides a new standard that can be used to validate machine learning works in the LB field.","Shen, Liu, Cui, Borole, Benjamin, Kording, Issadore","https://doi.org/10.1039/d0lc00096e","20200818","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16802,""
"The Active Compounds of Yixin Ningshen Tablet and Their Potential Action Mechanism in Treating Coronary Heart Disease- A Network Pharmacology and Proteomics Approach","Yixin Ningshen tablet is a CFDA-approved TCM formula for treating coronary heart disease (CHD) clinically. However, its active compounds and mechanism of action in treating CHD are unknown. In this study, a novel strategy with the combination of network pharmacology and proteomics was proposed to identify the active components of Yixin Ningshen tablet and the mechanism by which they treat CHD. With the application of network pharmacology, 62 active compounds in Yixin Ningshen tablet were screened out by text mining, and their 313 potential target proteins were identified by a tool in SwissTargetPrediction. These data were integrated with known CHD-related proteomics results to predict the most possible targets, which reduced the 313 potential target proteins to 218. The STRING database was retrieved to find the enriched pathways and related diseases of these target proteins, which indicated that the Calcium, MAPK, PI3K-Akt, cAMP, Rap1, AGE-RAGE, Relaxin, HIF-1, Prolactin, Sphingolipid, Estrogen, IL-17, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, necroptosis, arachidonic acid metabolism, insulin resistance, endocrine resistance, and steroid hormone biosynthesis might be the main pathways regulated by Yixin Ningshen tablet for the treatment of CHD. Through further enrichment analysis and literature study, EGFR, ERBB2, VGFR2, FGF1, ESR1, LOX15, PGH2, HMDH, ADRB1, and ADRB2 were selected and then validated to be the target proteins of Yixin Ningshen tablet by molecular docking, which indicated that Yixin Ningshen tablet might treat CHD mainly through promoting heart regeneration, new vessels' formation, and the blood supply of the myocardial region and reducing cardiac output, oxygen demand, and inflammation as well as arteriosclerosis (promoting vasodilation and intraplaque neoangiogenesis, lowering blood lipid). This study is expected to benefit the clinical application of Yixin Ningshen tablet for the treatment of CHD.","Lv, Wang, Wu, Shen, Ye","https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/4912395","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16803,""
"The online sexual offender: what we know to date","Online grooming is an active communicative entrapment network involving a wide range of techniques. The interactions that groomers have with minors online are complex. The purpose of the present literature review is to contribute to the existing knowledge base regarding online sex offender typologies, predatory tactics and techniques. We conducted a review of the current literature by an initial database research of papers published since 1990. Three independent reviewers selected relevant articles, initially based on title and abstract analysis, then by full text in order to make a final determination. After the final selection, a total of 21 articles were reviewed. Overall, abundant data describing both groomer characteristics and grooming strategies are available in the literature, with authors attempting to analyze and adapt these to ever-complex models. However, the various models often feel redundant, determining a certain difficulty in understanding which would be the most suitable model to apply, making comparing data from different studies oftentimes troublesome. In our opinion, it would be desirable to reach a consensus on fewer univocally- interpretable models that would be easier to adopt as preventive tools against online grooming, in combination with other strategies. The present study may provide parents and guardians with information useful for keeping their youth safer while online, as well as data that may assist in the development of policy recommendations and prevention strategies, overall aiming to reduce the phenomenon of online grooming.","Del Castillo, Gandolfi, Mosillo, Forni, Pietronigro, Tiwana, Pellai","https://doi.org/10.23736/S0026-4946.20.05621-2","20200518","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16804,""
"Artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support in modern medical physics: Selection, acceptance, commissioning, and quality assurance","Recent advances in machine and deep learning based on an increased availability of clinical data have fueled renewed interest in computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). CDSSs have shown great potential to improve healthcare, increase patient safety and reduce costs. However, the use of CDSSs is not without pitfalls, as an inadequate or faulty CDSS can potentially deteriorate the quality of healthcare and put patients at risk. In addition, the adoption of a CDSS might fail because its intended users ignore the output of the CDSS due to lack of trust, relevancy or actionability. In this article, we provide guidance based on literature for the different aspects involved in the adoption of a CDSS with a special focus on machine and deep learning based systems: selection, acceptance testing, commissioning, implementation and quality assurance. A rigorous selection process will help identify the CDSS that best fits the preferences and requirements of the local site. Acceptance testing will make sure that the selected CDSS fulfills the defined specifications and satisfies the safety requirements. The commissioning process will prepare the CDSS for safe clinical use at the local site. An effective implementation phase should result in an orderly roll out of the CDSS to the well-trained end-users whose expectations have been managed. And finally, quality assurance will make sure that the performance of the CDSS is maintained and that any issues are promptly identified and solved. We conclude that a systematic approach to the adoption of a CDSS will help avoid pitfalls, improve patient safety and increase the chances of success.","Mahadevaiah, Rv, Bermejo, Jaffray, Dekker, Wee","https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13562","20200630","artificial intelligence; clinical decision support; machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16805,""
"Analysis and Review of Automated Risk Calculators Used to Predict Postoperative Complications After Orthopedic Surgery","To discuss the automated risk calculators that have been developed and evaluated in orthopedic surgery. Identifying predictors of adverse outcomes following orthopedic surgery is vital in the decision-making process for surgeons and patients. Recently, automated risk calculators have been developed to quantify patient-specific preoperative risk associated with certain orthopedic procedures. Automated risk calculators may provide the orthopedic surgeon with a valuable tool for clinical decision-making, informed consent, and the shared decision-making process with the patient. Understanding how an automated risk calculator was developed is arguably as important as the performance of the calculator. Additionally, conveying and interpreting the results of these risk calculators with the patient and its influence on surgical decision-making are paramount. The most abundant research on automated risk calculators has been conducted in the spine, total hip and knee arthroplasty, and trauma literature. Currently, many risk calculators show promise, but much research is still needed to improve them. We recommend they be used only as adjuncts to clinical decision-making. Understanding how a calculator was developed, and accurate communication of results to the patient, is paramount.","Merrill, Ibrahim, Machi, Raphael","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12178-020-09632-0","20200928","Automated risk calculator; Orthopedic surgery; Postoperative complications; Predictive modeling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16806,""
"A dynamic reaction picklist for improving allergy reaction documentation in the electronic health record","Incomplete and static reaction picklists in the allergy module led to free-text and missing entries that inhibit the clinical decision support intended to prevent adverse drug reactions. We developed a novel, data-driven, &quot;dynamic&quot; reaction picklist to improve allergy documentation in the electronic health record (EHR). We split 3 decades of allergy entries in the EHR of a large Massachusetts healthcare system into development and validation datasets. We consolidated duplicate allergens and those with the same ingredients or allergen groups. We created a reaction value set via expert review of a previously developed value set and then applied natural language processing to reconcile reactions from structured and free-text entries. Three association rule-mining measures were used to develop a comprehensive reaction picklist dynamically ranked by allergen. The dynamic picklist was assessed using recall at top k suggested reactions, comparing performance to the static picklist. The modified reaction value set contained 490 reaction concepts. Among 4Ã‚Â 234Ã‚Â 327 allergy entries collected, 7463 unique consolidated allergens and 469 unique reactions were identified. Of the 3 dynamic reaction picklists developed, the 1 with the optimal ranking achieved recalls of 0.632, 0.763, and 0.822 at the top 5, 10, and 15, respectively, significantly outperforming the static reaction picklist ranked by reaction frequency. The dynamic reaction picklist developed using EHR data and a statistical measure was superior to the static picklist and suggested proper reactions for allergy documentation. Further studies might evaluate the usability and impact on allergy documentation in the EHR.","Wang, Blackley, Blumenthal, Yerneni, Goss, Lo, Shah, Ortega, Korach, Seger, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa042","20200630","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16807,""
"Explainable artificial intelligence models using real-world electronic healthÃ‚Â record data: a systematic scoping review","To conduct a systematic scoping review of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models that use real-world electronic health record data, categorize these techniques according to different biomedical applications, identify gaps of current studies, and suggest future research directions. We searched MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore, and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library to identify relevant papers published between January 1, 2009 and May 1, 2019. We summarized these studies based on the year of publication, prediction tasks, machine learning algorithm, dataset(s) used to build the models, the scope, category, and evaluation of the XAI methods. We further assessed the reproducibility of the studies in terms of the availability of data and code and discussed open issues and challenges. Forty-two articles were included in this review. We reported the research trend and most-studied diseases. We grouped XAI methods into 5 categories: knowledge distillation and rule extraction (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13), intrinsically interpretable models (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9), data dimensionality reduction (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8), attention mechanism (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7), and feature interaction and importance (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5). XAI evaluation is an open issue that requiresÃ‚Â a deeper focus in the case of medical applications. We also discuss the importance of reproducibility of research work in this field, as well as the challenges and opportunities of XAI from 2 medical professionals' point of view. Based on our review, we found that XAI evaluation in medicine has not been adequately and formally practiced. Reproducibility remains a critical concern. Ample opportunities exist to advance XAI research in medicine.","Payrovnaziri, Chen, Rengifo-Moreno, Miller, Bian, Chen, Liu, He","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa053","20200918","Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); deep learning; electronic health records; interpretable machine learning; real-world data","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16808,""
"Convolutional neural networks for classification of Alzheimer's disease: Overview and reproducible evaluation","Numerous machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed for automatic classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from brain imaging data. In particular, over 30 papers have proposed to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) for AD classification from anatomical MRI. However, the classification performance is difficult to compare across studies due to variations in components such as participant selection, image preprocessing or validation procedure. Moreover, these studies are hardly reproducible because their frameworks are not publicly accessible and because implementation details are lacking. Lastly, some of these papers may report a biased performance due to inadequate or unclear validation or model selection procedures. In the present work, we aim to address these limitations through three main contributions. First, we performed a systematic literature review. We identified four main types of approaches: i) 2D slice-level, ii) 3D patch-level, iii) ROI-based and iv) 3D subject-level CNN. Moreover, we found that more than half of the surveyed papers may have suffered from data leakage and thus reported biased performance. Our second contribution is the extension of our open-source framework for classification of AD using CNN and T1-weighted MRI. The framework comprises previously developed tools to automatically convert ADNI, AIBL and OASIS data into the BIDS standard, and a modular set of image preprocessing procedures, classification architectures and evaluation procedures dedicated to deep learning. Finally, we used this framework to rigorously compare different CNN architectures. The data was split into training/validation/test sets at the very beginning and only the training/validation sets were used for model selection. To avoid any overfitting, the test sets were left untouched until the end of the peer-review process. Overall, the different 3D approaches (3D-subject, 3D-ROI, 3D-patch) achieved similar performances while that of the 2D slice approach was lower. Of note, the different CNN approaches did not perform better than a SVM with voxel-based features. The different approaches generalized well to similar populations but not to datasets with different inclusion criteria or demographical characteristics. All the code of the framework and the experiments is publicly available: general-purpose tools have been integrated into the Clinica software (www.clinica.run) and the paper-specific code is available at: https://github.com/aramis-lab/AD-DL.","Wen, Thibeau-Sutre, Diaz-Melo, Samper-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Routier, Bottani, Dormont, Durrleman, Burgos, Colliot","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101694","20200716","Alzheimer's disease classification Magnetic resonance imaging; Convolutional neural network Reproducibility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16809,""
"Evaluating the alert appropriateness of clinical decision support systems in supporting clinical workflow","The overwhelming number of medication alerts generated by clinical decision support systems (CDSS) has led to inappropriate alert overrides, which may lead to unintended patient harm. This review highlights the factors affecting the alert appropriateness of CDSS and barriers to the fit of CDSS alert with clinical workflow. A literature review was conducted to identify features and functions pertinent to CDSS alert appropriateness using the five rights of CDSS. Moreover, a process improvement method, namely, Lean, was used as a tool to optimise clinical workflows, and the appropriate design for CDSS alert using a human automation interaction (HAI) model was recommended. Evaluating the appropriateness of CDSS alert and its impact on workflow provided insights into how alerts can be designed and triggered effectively to support clinical workflow. The application of Lean methods and tools to analyse alert efficiencies in supporting workflow in this study provides an in-depth understanding of alert-workflow fit problems and their root cause, which is required for improving CDSS design. The application of the HAI model is recommended in the design of CDSS alerts to support various levels and stages of alert automations, namely, information acquisition and analysis, decision action and action implementation.","Olakotan, Yusof","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103453","20200612","Alert override; Clinical decision support systems; Human automation interaction; Lean; Patient safety; Workflow","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16810,""
"Neural dynamics of sentiment processing during naturalistic sentence reading","When we read, our eyes move through the text in a series of fixations and high-velocity saccades to extract visual information. This process allows the brain to obtain meaning, e.g., about sentiment, or the emotional valence, expressed in the written text. How exactly the brain extracts the sentiment of single words during naturalistic reading is largely unknown. This is due to the challenges of naturalistic imaging, which has previously led researchers to employ highly controlled, timed word-by-word presentations of custom reading materials that lack ecological validity. Here, we aimed to assess the electrical neural correlates of word sentiment processing during naturalistic reading of English sentences. We used a publicly available dataset of simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking recordings, and word-level semantic annotations from 7129 words in 400 sentences (Zurich Cognitive Language Processing Corpus; Hollenstein etÃ‚Â al., 2018). We computed fixation-related potentials (FRPs), which are evoked electrical responses time-locked to the onset of fixations. A general linear mixed model analysis of FRPs cleaned from visual- and motor-evoked activity showed a topographical difference between the positive and negative sentiment condition in the 224-304Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹ms interval after fixation onset in left-central and right-posterior electrode clusters. An additional analysis that included word-, phrase-, and sentence-level sentiment predictors showed the same FRP differences for the word-level sentiment, but no additional FRP differences for phrase- and sentence-level sentiment. Furthermore, decoding analysis that classified word sentiment (positive or negative) from sentiment-matched 40-trial average FRPs showed a 0.60 average accuracy (95% confidence interval: [0.58, 0.61]). Control analyses ruled out that these results were based on differences in eye movements or linguistic features other than word sentiment. Our results extend previous research by showing that the emotional valence of lexico-semantic stimuli evoke a fast electrical neural response upon word fixation during naturalistic reading. These results provide an important step to identify the neural processes of lexico-semantic processing in ecologically valid conditions and can serve to improve computer algorithms for natural language processing.","Pfeiffer, Hollenstein, Zhang, Langer","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116934","20201020","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16811,""
"Pathophysiological and Genetic Aspects of Vascular Calcification","Recent evidence suggests that vascular calcification is an independent cardiovascular risk factor (CRF) of morbidity and mortality. New studies point out the existence of a complex physiopathological mechanism that involves inflammation, oxidation, the release of chemical mediators, and genetic factors that promote the osteochondrogenic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). This review will evaluate the main mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology and genetics modulation of the process of vascular calcification. <i>Objective.</i> A systematic review of the pathophysiology factors involved in vascular calcification and its genetic influence was performed. <i>Methods.</i> A systematic review was conducted in the Medline and PubMed databases and were searched for studies concerning vascular calcification using the keywords and studies published until 2020/01 in English. <i>Inclusion Criteria</i>.

"Multiple Network Disconnection in Anosognosia for Hemiplegia","Anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP) is a complex syndrome whose neural correlates are still under investigation. One hypothesis, mainly based on lesion mapping studies, is that AHP reflects a breakdown of neural systems of the right hemisphere involved in motor function. However, more recent theories have suggested that AHP may represent a disorder of cognitive systems involved in belief updating, self-referential or body processing. Two recent studies, using a method to estimate the degree of white matter disconnection from lesions, have indeed shown that patients with AHP suffer from damage of several long-range white matter pathways in association cortex. Here, we use a similar indirect disconnection approach to study a group of patients with motor deficits without anosognosia (hemiparesis or hemiplegia, HP, <i>n</i> = 35), or motor deficits with AHP (<i>n</i> = 28). The HP lesions came from a database of stroke patients, while cases of AHP were selected from the published literature. Lesions were traced into an atlas from illustrations of the publications using a standard method. There was no region in the brain that was more damaged in AHP than HP. In terms of structural connectivity, AHP patients had a similar pattern of disconnection of motor pathways to HP patients. However, AHP patients also showed significant disconnection of the right temporo-parietal junction, right insula, right lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. These associative cortical regions were connected through several white matter tracts, including superior longitudinal fasciculus III, arcuate, fronto-insular, frontal inferior longitudinal, and frontal aslant. These tracts connected regions of different cognitive networks: default, ventral attention, and cingulo-opercular. These results were not controlled for clinical variables as concomitant symptoms and other disorders of body representation were not always available for co-variate analysis. In conclusion, we confirm recent studies of disconnection demonstrating that AHP is not limited to dysfunction of motor systems, but involves a much wider set of large-scale cortical networks.","Monai, Bernocchi, Bisio, Bisogno, Salvalaggio, Corbetta","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00021","20200928","anosognosia; awareness; hemiplegia; network; stroke; structural disconnection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16813,""
"Data mining-based model and risk prediction of colorectal cancer by using secondary health data: A systematic review","Prevention and early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) can increase the chances of successful treatment and reduce burden. Various data mining technologies have been utilized to strengthen the early detection of CRC in primary care. Evidence synthesis on the model's effectiveness is scant. This systematic review synthesizes studies that examine the effect of data mining on improving risk prediction of CRC. The PRISMA framework guided the conduct of this study. We obtained papers via PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Google Scholar. Quality appraisal was performed using Downs and Black's quality checklist. To evaluate the performance of included models, the values of specificity and sensitivity were comparted, the values of area under the curve (AUC) were plotted, and the median of overall AUC of included studies was computed. A total of 316 studies were reviewed for full text. Seven articles were included. Included studies implement techniques including artificial neural networks, Bayesian networks and decision trees. Six articles reported the overall model accuracy. Overall, the median AUC is 0.8243 [interquartile range (IQR): 0.8050-0.8886]. In the two articles that reported comparison results with traditional models, the data mining method performed better than the traditional models, with the best AUC improvement of 10.7%.

"Broad-coverage biomedical relation extraction with SemRep","In the era of information overload, natural language processing (NLP) techniques are increasingly needed to support advanced biomedical information management and discovery applications. In this paper, we present an in-depth description of SemRep, an NLP system that extracts semantic relations from PubMed abstracts using linguistic principles and UMLS domain knowledge. We also evaluate SemRep on two datasets. In one evaluation, we use a manually annotated test collection and perform a comprehensive error analysis. In another evaluation, we assess SemRep's performance on the CDR dataset, a standard benchmark corpus annotated with causal chemical-disease relationships. A strict evaluation of SemRep on our manually annotated dataset yields 0.55 precision, 0.34 recall, and 0.42 F <sub>1</sub> score. A relaxed evaluation, which more accurately characterizes SemRep performance, yields 0.69 precision, 0.42 recall, and 0.52 F <sub>1</sub> score. An error analysis reveals named entity recognition/normalization as the largest source of errors (26.9%), followed by argument identification (14%) and trigger detection errors (12.5%). The evaluation on the CDR corpus yields 0.90 precision, 0.24 recall, and 0.38 F <sub>1</sub> score. The recall and the F <sub>1</sub> score increase to 0.35 and 0.50, respectively, when the evaluation on this corpus is limited to sentence-bound relationships, which represents a fairer evaluation, as SemRep operates at the sentence level. SemRep is a broad-coverage, interpretable, strong baseline system for extracting semantic relations from biomedical text. It also underpins SemMedDB, a literature-scale knowledge graph based on semantic relations. Through SemMedDB, SemRep has had significant impact in the scientific community, supporting a variety of clinical and translational applications, including clinical decision making, medical diagnosis, drug repurposing, literature-based discovery and hypothesis generation, and contributing to improved health outcomes. In ongoing development, we are redesigning SemRep to increase its modularity and flexibility, and addressing weaknesses identified in the error analysis.","Kilicoglu, Rosemblat, Fiszman, Shin","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-3517-7","20200708","Biomedical relation extraction; Natural language processing; Scientific publications; Semantic interpretation; Algorithms; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Natural Language Processing; PubMed; Semantics; Unified Medical Language System","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16815,""
"Quantitative Prostate MRI","Prostate MRI is reported in clinical practice using the Prostate Imaging and Data Reporting System (PI-RADS). PI-RADS aims to standardize, as much as possible, the acquisition, interpretation, reporting, and ultimately the performance of prostate MRI. PI-RADS relies upon mainly subjective analysis of MR imaging findings, with very few incorporated quantitative features. The shortcomings of PI-RADS are mainly: low-to-moderate interobserver agreement and modest accuracy for detection of clinically significant tumors in the transition zone. The use of a more quantitative analysis of prostate MR imaging findings is therefore of interest. Quantitative MR imaging features including: tumor size and volume, tumor length of capsular contact, tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) metrics, tumor T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> relaxation times, tumor shape, and texture analyses have all shown value for improving characterization of observations detected on prostate MRI and for differentiating between tumors by their pathological grade and stage. Quantitative analysis may therefore improve diagnostic accuracy for detection of cancer and could be a noninvasive means to predict patient prognosis and guide management. Since quantitative analysis of prostate MRI is less dependent on an individual users' assessment, it could also improve interobserver agreement. Semi- and fully automated analysis of quantitative (radiomic) MRI features using artificial neural networks represent the next step in quantitative prostate MRI and are now being actively studied. Validation, through high-quality multicenter studies assessing diagnostic accuracy for clinically significant prostate cancer detection, in the domain of quantitative prostate MRI is needed. This article reviews advances in quantitative prostate MRI, highlighting the strengths and limitations of existing and emerging techniques, as well as discussing opportunities and challenges for evaluation of prostate MRI in clinical practice when using quantitative assessment.

"Functional neuroimaging of human postural control: A systematic review with meta-analysis","Postural instability is a strong risk factor for falls that becomes more prominent with aging. To facilitate treatment and prevention of falls in an aging society, a thorough understanding of the neural networks underlying postural control is warranted. Here, we present a systematic review of the functional neuroimaging literature of studies measuring posture-related neural activity in healthy subjects. Study methods were overall heterogeneous. Eleven out of the 14 studies relied on postural simulation in a supine position (e.g. motor imagery). The key nodes of human postural control involved the brainstem, cerebellum, basal ganglia, thalamus and several cortical regions. An activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis revealed that the anterior cerebellum was consistently activated across the wide range of postural tasks. The cerebellum is known to modulate the brainstem nuclei involved in the control of posture. Hence, this systematic review with meta-analysis provides insight into the neural correlates which underpin human postural control and which may serve as a reference for future neural network and region of interest analyses.","Dijkstra, Bekkers, Gilat, de Rond, Hardwick, Nieuwboer","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.04.028","20200921","Balance; Functional neuroimaging; MRI; Meta-Analysis; PET; Postural control; Posture","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16819,""

However, there are several unresolved issues regarding MVA prediction such as the effect of number of ECG features on a prediction remaining unclear, possibility that an alert for occurring MVA may arrive very late and uncertainty in the performance of the algorithm predicting MVA minutes before onset. To overcome the aforementioned problems, this research conducts an in-depth study on the number and types of ECG features that are implemented in a decision tree classifier. In addition, this research also investigates an algorithm's execution time before the occurrence of MVA to minimize delays in warnings for MVA. Lastly, this research aims to study both the sensitivity and specificity of an algorithm to reveal the performance of MVA prediction algorithms from time to time. To strengthen the results of analysis, several classifiers such as support vector machine and naive Bayes are also examined for the purpose of comparison study. There are three phases required to achieve the objectives. The first phase is literature review on existing relevant studies. The second phase deals with design and development of four modules for predicting MVA. Rigorous experiments are performed in the feature selection and classification modules. The results show that eight ECG features with decision tree classifier achieved good prediction performance in terms of execution time and sensitivity. In addition, the results show that the highest percentage for sensitivity and specificity is 95% and 90% respectively, in the fourth 5-minute interval (15.1 minutes-20 minutes) that preceded the onset of an arrhythmia event. Such results imply that the fourth 5-minute interval would be the best time to perform prediction.","Mandala, Cai Di, Sunar, Adiwijaya","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231635","20200723","Adult; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Bayes Theorem; Decision Trees; Electrocardiography; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Sensitivity and Specificity; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16820,""
"Automatic Triage of 12-Lead ECGs Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","BACKGROUND The correct interpretation of the ECG is pivotal for the accurate diagnosis of many cardiac abnormalities, and conventional computerized interpretation has not been able to reach physician-level accuracy in detecting (acute) cardiac abnormalities. This study aims to develop and validate a deep neural network for comprehensive automated ECG triage in daily practice. METHODS AND RESULTS We developed a 37-layer convolutional residual deep neural network on a data set of free-text physician-annotated 12-lead ECGs. The deep neural network was trained on a data set with 336.835 recordings from 142.040 patients and validated on an independent validation data set (n=984), annotated by a panel of 5 cardiologists electrophysiologists. The 12-lead ECGs were acquired in all noncardiology departments of the University Medical Center Utrecht. The algorithm learned to classify these ECGs into the following 4 triage categories: normal, abnormal not acute, subacute, and acute. Discriminative performance is presented with overall and category-specific concordance statistics, polytomous discrimination indexes, sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values. The patients in the validation data set had a mean age of 60.4Ã‚Â years and 54.3% were men. The deep neural network showed excellent overall discrimination with an overall concordance statistic of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.92-0.95) and a polytomous discriminatory index of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79-0.87). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that an end-to-end deep neural network can be accurately trained on unstructured free-text physician annotations and used to consistently triage 12-lead ECGs. When further fine-tuned with other clinical outcomes and externally validated in clinical practice, the demonstrated deep learning-based ECG interpretation can potentially improve time to treatment and decrease healthcare burden.","van de Leur, Blom, Gavves, Hof, van der Heijden, Clappers, Doevendans, Hassink, van Es","https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.119.015138","20200518","deep learning; deep neural networks; electrocardiography; triage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16821,""
"Imaging in Spine Surgery: Current Concepts and Future Directions","To review and highlight the historical and recent advances of imaging in spine surgery and to discuss current applications and future directions. A PubMed review of the current literature was performed on all relevant articles that examined historical and recent imaging techniques used in spine surgery. Studies were examined for their thoroughness in description of various modalities and applications in current and future management. We reviewed 97 articles that discussed past, present, and future applications for imaging in spine surgery. Although most historical approaches relied heavily upon basic radiography, more recent advances have begun to expand upon advanced modalities, including the integration of more sophisticated equipment and artificial intelligence. Since the days of conventional radiography, various modalities have emerged and become integral components of the spinal surgeon's diagnostic armamentarium. As such, it behooves the practitioner to remain informed on the current trends and potential developments in spinal imaging, as rapid adoption and interpretation of new techniques may make significant differences in patient management and outcomes. Future directions will likely become increasingly sophisticated as the implementation of machine learning, and artificial intelligence has become more commonplace in clinical practice.","Harada, Siyaji, Younis, Louie, Samartzis, An","https://doi.org/10.22603/ssrr.2020-0011","20200928","artificial intelligence; computed tomography; guided navigation; imaging; machine learning; magnetic resonance; radiograph; spine surgery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16822,""
"Current methods for development of rapid reviews about diagnostic tests: an international survey","Rapid reviews (RRs) have emerged as an efficient alternative to time-consuming systematic reviews-they can help meet the demand for accelerated evidence synthesis to inform decision-making in healthcare. The synthesis of diagnostic evidence has important methodological challenges. Here, we performed an international survey to identify the current practice of producing RRs for diagnostic tests. We developed and administered an online survey inviting institutions that perform RRs of diagnostic tests from all over the world. All participants (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°25) reported the implementation of one or more methods to define the scope of the RR; however, only one strategy (defining a structured question) was used by Ã¢â€°Â¥90% of participants. All participants used at least one methodological shortcut including the use of a previous review as a starting point (92%) and the use of limits on the search (96%). Parallelization and automation of review tasks were not extensively used (48 and 20%, respectively). Our survey indicates a greater use of shortcuts and limits for conducting diagnostic test RRs versus the results of a recent scoping review analyzing published RRs. Several shortcuts are used without knowing how their implementation affects the results of the evidence synthesis in the setting of diagnostic test reviews. Thus, a structured evaluation of the challenges and implications of the adoption of these RR methods is warranted.","Arevalo-Rodriguez, Steingart, Tricco, Nussbaumer-Streit, Kaunelis, Alonso-Coello, Baxter, Bossuyt, Emparanza, Zamora","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01004-z","20200516","Decision-making; Diagnosis; Knowledge synthesis; Rapid reviews; Tests","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16823,""

"Transfer Learning for Risk Classification of Social Media Posts: Model Evaluation Study","Mental illness affects a significant portion of the worldwide population. Online mental health forums can provide a supportive environment for those afflicted and also generate a large amount of data that can be mined to predict mental health states using machine learning methods. This study aimed to benchmark multiple methods of text feature representation for social media posts and compare their downstream use with automated machine learning (AutoML) tools. We tested on datasets that contain posts labeled for perceived suicide risk or moderator attention in the context of self-harm. Specifically, we assessed the ability of the methods to prioritize posts that a moderator would identify for immediate response. We used 1588 labeled posts from the Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) 2017 shared task collected from the Reachout.com forum. Posts were represented using lexicon-based tools, including Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, Empath, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, and also using pretrained artificial neural network models, including DeepMoji, Universal Sentence Encoder, and Generative Pretrained Transformer-1 (GPT-1). We used Tree-based Optimization Tool and Auto-Sklearn as AutoML tools to generate classifiers to triage the posts. The top-performing system used features derived from the GPT-1 model, which was fine-tuned on over 150,000 unlabeled posts from Reachout.com. Our top system had a macroaveraged F1 score of 0.572, providing a new state-of-the-art result on the CLPsych 2017 task. This was achieved without additional information from metadata or preceding posts. Error analyses revealed that this top system often misses expressions of hopelessness. In addition, we have presented visualizations that aid in the understanding of the learned classifiers. In this study, we found that transfer learning is an effective strategy for predicting risk with relatively little labeled data and noted that fine-tuning of pretrained language models provides further gains when large amounts of unlabeled text are available.","Howard, Maslej, Lee, Ritchie, Woollard, French","https://doi.org/10.2196/15371","20200901","classification; data interpretation, statistical; machine learning; mental health; natural language processing; social support; transfer learning; triage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16825,""
"The value of S-Detect for the differential diagnosis of breast masses on ultrasound: a systematic review and pooled meta-analysis","To evaluate the value of S-Detect (a computer aided diagnosis system using deep learning) in breast ultrasound (US) for discriminating benign and malignant breast masses. A literature search was performed and relevant studies using S-Detect for the differential diagnosis of breast masses were selected. The quality of included studies was assessed using a Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) questionnaire. Two review authors independently searched the articles and assessed the eligibility of the reports. A total of ten studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 0.82 (95%CI: 0.77-0.87) and 0.86 (95%CI: 0.76-0.92), respectively. In addition, the diagnostic odds ratios, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 28 (95%CI: 16- 49), 5.7 (95%CI: 3.4-9.5), and 0.21 (95%CI: 0.16-0.27), respectively. Area under the curve was 0.89 (95%CI: 0.86-0.92). No significant publication bias was observed. S-Detect exhibited a favourable diagnostic value in assisting physicians discriminating benign and malignant breast masses and it can be considered as a useful complement for conventional US.","Li, Sang, Yu, Jiang, Hunag, Cao, Chen, Cao, Cui, Dietrich","https://doi.org/10.11152/mu-2402","20200513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16826,""
"Drug repositioning for psychiatric and neurological disorders through a network medicine approach","Psychiatric and neurological disorders (PNDs) affect millions worldwide and only a few drugs achieve complete therapeutic success in the treatment of these disorders. Due to the high cost of developing novel drugs, drug repositioning represents a promising alternative method of treatment. In this manuscript, we used a network medicine approach to investigate the molecular characteristics of PNDs and identify novel drug candidates for repositioning. Using IBM Watson for Drug Discovery, a powerful machine learning text-mining application, we built knowledge networks containing connections between PNDs and genes or drugs mentioned in the scientific literature published in the past 50 years. This approach revealed several drugs that target key PND-related genes, which have never been used to treat these disorders to date. We validate our framework by detecting drugs that have been undergoing clinical trial for treating some of the PNDs, but have no published results in their support. Our data provides comprehensive insights into the molecular pathology of PNDs and offers promising drug repositioning candidates for follow-up trials.","LÃƒÂ¼scher Dias, Schuch, BeltrÃƒÂ£o-Braga, Martins-de-Souza, Brentani, Franco, Nakaya","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-0827-5","20200901","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16827,""
"Clinical Theragnostic Potential of Diverse miRNA Expressions in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","<i>Background:</i> Prostate cancer (PrC) is the second-most frequent cancer in men, its incidence is emerging globally and is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. While diagnosis and prognosis of PrC have been studied well, the associated therapeutic biomarkers have not yet been investigated comprehensively. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the theragnostic effects of microRNA expressions on chemoresistance in prostate cancer and to analyse the utility of miRNAs as clinical theragnostic biomarkers. <i>Methods:</i> A systematic literature search for studies reporting miRNA expressions and their role in chemoresistance in PrC published until 2018 was collected from bibliographic databases. The evaluation of data was performed as per PRISMA guidelines for systematic review and meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. Heterogeneity between studies was analysed using Cochran's Q test, I<sup>2</sup> and the Tau statistic. Quality assessment of the studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for the methodological assessment of cohort studies. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's bias indicator test, Orwin and classic fail-safe N test, Begg and Mazumdar rank collection test, and Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill methods. <i>Findings:</i> Out of 2909 studies retrieved, 79 studies were shortlisted and reviewed. A total of 17 studies met our eligibility criteria, from which 779 PrC patients and 17 chemotherapy drugs were examined, including docetaxel and paclitaxel. The majority of the drug regulatory genes reported were involved in cell survival, angiogenesis and cell proliferation pathways. We studied 42 miRNAs across all studies, out of which two miRNAs were found to be influencing chemosensitivity, while 21 were involved in chemoresistance. However, the remaining 19 miRNAs did not appear to have any theragnostic effects. Besides, the prognostic impact of the miRNAs was evaluated and had a pooled HR value of 1.960 with 95% CI (1.377-2.791). <i>Interpretation:</i> The observation of the current study depicts the significance of miRNA expression as a theragnostic biomarker in medical oncology. This review suggests the involvement of specific miRNAs as predictors of chemoresistance and sensitivity in PrC. Hence, the current systematic review and meta-analysis provide insight on the use of miRNA as PrC biomarkers, which can be harnessed as molecular candidates for therapeutic targeting.","Jayaraj, Raymond, Krishnan, Tzou, Baxi, Ram, Govind, Chandramoorthy, Abu-Khzam, Shaw","https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12051199","20200928","chemoresistance; meta-analysis; miRNA; systematic review; theragnostic potential","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16828,""
"Using case-level context to classify cancer pathology reports","Individual electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical reports are often part of a larger sequence-for example, a single patient may generate multiple reports over the trajectory of a disease. In applications such as cancer pathology reports, it is necessary not only to extract information from individual reports, but also to capture aggregate information regarding the entire cancer case based off case-level context from all reports in the sequence. In this paper, we introduce a simple modular add-on for capturing case-level context that is designed to be compatible with most existing deep learning architectures for text classification on individual reports. We test our approach on a corpus of 431,433 cancer pathology reports, and we show that incorporating case-level context significantly boosts classification accuracy across six classification tasks-site, subsite, laterality, histology, behavior, and grade. We expect that with minimal modifications, our add-on can be applied towards a wide range of other clinical text-based tasks.","Gao, Alawad, Schaefferkoetter, Penberthy, Wu, Durbin, Coyle, Ramanathan, Tourassi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232840","20200730","Electronic Health Records; Histological Techniques; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Neoplasms; SEER Program","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16829,""
"Bridging the &quot;last mile&quot; gap between AI implementation and operation: &quot;data awareness&quot; that matters","Interest in the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to medicine is growing fast and wide because of their ability to endow decision support systems with so-called artificial intelligence, particularly in those medical disciplines that extensively rely on digital imaging. Nonetheless, achieving a pragmatic and ecological validation of medical AI systems in real-world settings is difficult, even when these systems exhibit very high accuracy in laboratory settings. This difficulty has been called the &quot;last mile of implementation.&quot; In this review of the concept, we claim that this metaphorical mile presents two chasms: the hiatus of human trust and the hiatus of machine experience. The former hiatus encompasses all that can hinder the concrete use of AI at the point of care, including availability and usability issues, but also the contradictory phenomena of cognitive ergonomics, such as automation bias (overreliance on technology) and prejudice against the machine (clearly the opposite). The latter hiatus, on the other hand, relates to the production and availability of a sufficient amount of reliable and accurate clinical data that is suitable to be the &quot;experience&quot; with which a machine can be trained. In briefly reviewing the existing literature, we focus on this latter hiatus of the last mile, as it has been largely neglected by both ML developers and doctors. In doing so, we argue that efforts to cross this chasm require data governance practices and a focus on data work, including the practices of data awareness and data hygiene. To address the challenge of bridging the chasms in the last mile of medical AI implementation, we discuss the six main socio-technical challenges that must be overcome in order to build robust bridges and deploy potentially effective AI in real-world clinical settings.","Cabitza, Campagner, Balsano","https://doi.org/10.21037/atm.2020.03.63","20200928","Artificial intelligence; DevOps; data hygiene; last mile","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16830,""

"Applications of radiomics and machine learning for radiotherapy of malignant brain tumors","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amino acid positron-emission tomography (PET) of the brain contain aÃ‚Â vast amount of structural and functional information that can be analyzed by machine learning algorithms and radiomics for the use of radiotherapy in patients with malignant brain tumors. This study is based on comprehensive literature research on machine learning and radiomics analyses in neuroimaging and their potential application for radiotherapy in patients with malignant glioma or brain metastases. Feature-based radiomics and deep learning-based machine learning methods can be used to improve brain tumor diagnostics and automate various steps of radiotherapy planning. In glioma patients, important applications are the determination of WHO grade and molecular markers for integrated diagnosis in patients not eligible for biopsy or resection, automatic image segmentation for target volume planning, prediction of the location of tumor recurrence, and differentiation of pseudoprogression from actual tumor progression. In patients with brain metastases, radiomics is applied for additional detection of smaller brain metastases, accurate segmentation of multiple larger metastases, prediction of local response after radiosurgery, and differentiation of radiation injury from local brain metastasis relapse. Importantly, high diagnostic accuracies of 80-90% can be achieved by most approaches, despite aÃ‚Â large variety in terms of applied imaging techniques and computational methods. Clinical application of automated image analyses based on radiomics and artificial intelligence has aÃ‚Â great potential for improving radiotherapy in patients with malignant brain tumors. However, aÃ‚Â common problem associated with these techniques is the large variability and the lack of standardization of the methods applied.","Kocher, Ruge, Galldiks, Lohmann","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00066-020-01626-8","20201026","Artificial intelligence; Brain metastases; Deep learning; Glioma; Multiparametric PET/MRI","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16833,""

"Machine learning in GI endoscopy: practical guidance in how to interpret a novel field","There has been a vast increase in GI literature focused on the use of machine learning in endoscopy. The relative novelty of this field poses a challenge for reviewers and readers of GI journals. To appreciate scientific quality and novelty of machine learning studies, understanding of the technical basis and commonly used techniques is required. Clinicians often lack this technical background, while machine learning experts may be unfamiliar with clinical relevance and implications for daily practice. Therefore, there is an increasing need for a multidisciplinary, international evaluation on how to perform high-quality machine learning research in endoscopy. This review aims to provide guidance for readers and reviewers of peer-reviewed GI journals to allow critical appraisal of the most relevant quality requirements of machine learning studies.

"Green Supplier Selection Based on Green Practices Evaluated Using Fuzzy Approaches of TOPSIS and ELECTRE with a Case Study in a Chinese Internet Company","The selection of appropriate green chain suppliers is a very critical decision for effective and efficient green supply chain management in today's increased awareness and significant environmental pressures from various stakeholders. The aim of this paper is to screen appropriate green chain suppliers based on a framework using fuzzy TOPSIS and ELECTRE for a Chinese internet company. The framework is proposed, grounded on a literature review on green supply chain management practices, after which an empirical analysis is made to be applied an integrated suppliers selection, based on green practices incorporating specifically data collected of the 12 criteria from a set of 12 available suppliers. We use a fuzzy TOPSIS and ELECTRE approach to rank the green chain suppliers, and the results of the proposed framework are compared with the ranks obtained by both the outranking degrees and the incomparability among the actions of fuzzy ELECTRE methodology. Finally, sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the feasibility of the best alternative. The results indicated that the best supplier was alternative 9, and there were four dominant criteria: management support for GSCM, used environmentally friendly materials, followed legal environmental requirements and policies, and reduced the use of harmful substances.","Qu, Zhang, Qu, Xu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17093268","20201015","ELECTRE; fuzzy TOPSIS; green supply chain management (GSCM); supplier selection; triangular fuzzy number; Commerce; Conservation of Natural Resources; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Fuzzy Logic; Internet","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16837,""
"Differentiating Peripherally-Located Small Cell Lung Cancer From Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Using a CT Radiomic Approach","Lung cancer can be classified into two main categories: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which are different in treatment strategy and survival probability. The lung CT images of SCLC and NSCLC are similar such that their subtle differences are hardly visually discernible by the human eye through conventional imaging evaluation. We hypothesize that SCLC/NSCLC differentiation could be achieved via computerized image feature analysis and classification in feature space, as termed a radiomic model. The purpose of this study was to use CT radiomics to differentiate SCLC from NSCLC adenocarcinoma. Patients with primary lung cancer, either SCLC or NSCLC adenocarcinoma, were retrospectively identified. The post-diagnosis pre-treatment lung CT images were used to segment the lung cancers. Radiomic features were extracted from histogram-based statistics, textural analysis of tumor images and their wavelet transforms. A minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance method was used for feature selection. The predictive model was constructed with a multilayer artificial neural network. The performance of the SCLC/NSCLC adenocarcinoma classifier was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Our study cohort consisted of 69 primary lung cancer patients with SCLC (<i>n</i> = 35; age mean Ã‚Â± SD = 66.91Ã‚Â± 9.75 years), and NSCLC adenocarcinoma (<i>n</i> = 34; age mean Ã‚Â± SD = 58.55 Ã‚Â± 11.94 years). The SCLC group had more male patients and smokers than the NSCLC group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Our SCLC/NSCLC classifier achieved an overall performance of AUC of 0.93 (95% confidence interval = [0.85, 0.97]), sensitivity = 0.85, and specificity = 0.85). Adding clinical data such as smoking history could improve the performance slightly. The top ranking radiomic features were mostly textural features. Our results showed that CT radiomics could quantitatively represent tumor heterogeneity and therefore could be used to differentiate primary lung cancer subtypes with satisfying results. CT image processing with the wavelet transformation technique enhanced the radiomic features for SCLC/NSCLC classification. Our pilot study should motivate further investigation of radiomics as a non-invasive approach for early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer.","Chen, Chen, Ye, Mambetsariev, Fricke, Daniel, Wang, Wong, Rockne, Colen, Nasser, Batra, Holodny, Sampath, Salgia","https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.00593","20201002","artificial neural network; computed tomography radiomics (CT Radiomics); non-linear classifier; non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); small cell lung cancer (SCLC)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16838,""
"Evaluation of the accuracy of algorithms to identify soft tissue sarcoma (STS) in administrative claims","Lack of using a validated algorithm to select patients is a source of selection bias in oncology studies using administrative claims. The objective of this study to evaluate published algorithms to identify patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) in administrative claims and to evaluate new algorithms to improved performance. Two cancer populations including STS cases and non-STS controls were selected from the MarketScan Explorys Linked Claims-Electronic Medical Record (EMR) Database between January 1, 2000 and July 31, 2018. Eligible cases had a diagnosis on a clinical record for STS in the EMR while controls had no evidence of STS on any EMR records. Both cases and controls were enrolled in administrative claims during a period of observation and were agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â years. A split sample was used to test and validate algorithms using data from administrative claims. Values for sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated for 14 algorithms. Prior literature validating algorithms in administrative claims across other cancer types report both sensitivity and specificity ranging from as low as 73% to as high as 95%. This was used as a benchmark for defining algorithm success. There were 784 STS cases and 249,062 non-STS cancer controls eligible for analysis. Requiring at least two claims with an ICD-CM diagnosis code for STS achieved a sensitivity of 67% but had a specificity of 72%. Algorithms that required NCCN-recommended systemic treatment for STS improved the specificity to over 90% but dropped the sensitivity to below 20%. Other combinations of diagnostic tests, symptoms, and procedures did not improve performance. The algorithms tested in this study sample did not achieve sufficient performance and suggest the ability to accurately identify the STS population in administrative data is problematic. Difficulties are likely due to the origin of STS in a variety of locations, the non-specific symptoms of STS, and the common diagnostic tests recommended to diagnose the disease. Future research applying machine learning to examine timing and patterns of variables that comprise the diagnostic process may further investigate the ability to accurately identify STS cases in claims databases.","Princic, McMorrow, Chan, Hess","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13569-020-00130-y","20200928","Administrative claims; Coding; Methods; Soft tissue sarcoma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16839,""
"A Literature Review of Gene Function Prediction by Modeling Gene Ontology","Annotating the functional properties of gene products, i.e., RNAs and proteins, is a fundamental task in biology. The Gene Ontology database (GO) was developed to systematically describe the functional properties of gene products across species, and to facilitate the computational prediction of gene function. As GO is routinely updated, it serves as the gold standard and main knowledge source in functional genomics. Many gene function prediction methods making use of GO have been proposed. But no literature review has summarized these methods and the possibilities for future efforts from the perspective of GO. To bridge this gap, we review the existing methods with an emphasis on recent solutions. First, we introduce the conventions of GO and the widely adopted evaluation metrics for gene function prediction. Next, we summarize current methods of gene function prediction that apply GO in different ways, such as using hierarchical or flat inter-relationships between GO terms, compressing massive GO terms and quantifying semantic similarities. Although many efforts have improved performance by harnessing GO, we conclude that there remain many largely overlooked but important topics for future research.","Zhao, Wang, Chen, Zhang, Guo, Yu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.00400","20200928","directed acyclic graph; functional genomics; gene function prediction; gene ontology; inter-relationships; semantic similarity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16840,""
"The Use of New Technologies for Improving Reading Comprehension","Since the introduction of writing systems, reading comprehension has always been a foundation for achievement in several areas within the educational system, as well as a prerequisite for successful participation in most areas of adult life. The increased availability of technologies and web-based resources can be a really valid support, both in the educational and clinical field, to devise training activities that can also be carried out remotely. There are studies in current literature that has examined the efficacy of internet-based programs for reading comprehension for children with reading comprehension difficulties but almost none considered distance rehabilitation programs. The present paper reports data concerning a distance program <i>Cloze</i>, developed in Italy, for improving language and reading comprehension. Twenty-eight children from 3rd to 6th grade with comprehension difficulties were involved. These children completed the distance program for 15-20 min for at least three times a week for about 4 months. The program was presented separately to each child, with a degree of difficulty adapted to his/her characteristics. Text reading comprehension (assessed distinguishing between narrative and informative texts) increased after intervention. These findings have clinical and educational implications as they suggest that it is possible to promote reading comprehension with a distance individualized program, avoiding the need for the child displacements, necessary for reaching a rehabilitation center.","Capodieci, Cornoldi, Doerr, Bertolo, Carretti","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00751","20200928","Cloze app; digital device; distance rehabilitation program; reading comprehension; training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16841,""
"Active Learning in Psychiatry Education: Current Practices and Future Perspectives","Over the past few decades, medical education has seen increased interest in the use of active learning formats to engage learners and promote knowledge application over knowledge acquisition. The field of psychiatry, in particular, has pioneered a host of novel active learning paradigms. These have contributed to our understanding of the role of andragogy along the continuum of medical education, from undergraduate to continuing medical education. In an effort to frame the successes and failures of various attempts at integrating active learning into healthcare curricula, a group of educators from the A. B. Baker Section on Neurological Education from the American Academy of Neurology reviewed the state of the field in its partner field of medical neuroscience. Herein we provide a narrative review of the literature, outlining the basis for implementing active learning, the novel formats that have been used, and the lessons learned from qualitative and quantitative analysis of the research that has been done to date. While preparation time seems to present the greatest obstacle to acceptance from learners and educators, there is generally positive reception to the new educational formats. Additionally, most assessments of trainee performance have suggested non-inferiority (if not superiority). However, occasional mixed findings point to a need for better assessments of the type of learning that these new formats engender: knowledge application rather than acquisition. Moreover, this field is relatively nascent and, in order to ascertain how best to integrate active learning into psychiatry education, a framework for quantitative outcome assessments is needed going forward.","Sandrone, Berthaud, Carlson, Cios, Dixit, Farheen, Kraker, Owens, Patino, Sarva, Weber, Schneider","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00211","20200928","active learning; clinical reasoning; curriculum design; flipped classroom; flipping the classroom; flipping the curriculum; psychiatry education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16842,""
"Does the Setting of External Ventricular Drain Placement Affect Morbidity? A Systematic Literature Review Comparing Intensive Care Unit versus Operating Room Procedures","External ventricular drain (EVD) placement can be performed at the bedside in the neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) or in the operating room (OR). Systematic review and meta-analysis may permit stronger recommendations to improve accuracy and complication rates. Systematic review of PubMed was performed (inception-December 12, 2019) following PRISMA guidelines. Our search yielded 356 articles, of which 37 studies underwent full-text analysis. Nine studies met inclusion criteria. Studies were segregated into OR only (nÃ‚Â = 3; 1011 patients), ICU only (nÃ‚Â = 3; 325 patients), and ORÃ‚Â + ICU (nÃ‚Â = 3; 613 patients) cohorts. Studies were in addition divided by outcome measures, including catheter placement accuracy (ICU, 4 studies, nÃ‚Â = 280 [68.29%] vs. OR, 2 studies, nÃ‚Â = 198 [84.25%]); iatrogenic hemorrhagic complications (ICU, 4 studies, nÃ‚Â = 112 [18.16%] vs. OR, 2 studies, nÃ‚Â = 35 [17.50%]); and ventriculostomy-related infection rates (ICU, 4 studies, nÃ‚Â = 48 [7.28%] vs. OR: 5 studies, nÃ‚Â = 92 [8.06%]). There are likely specific patient populations who would benefit from EVD placement in the ICU versus OR setting. The literature comparing efficacy and morbidity between EVDs placed in the ICU and OR settings is overall inconclusive in both sample size and congruence of methodology.

"A Systematic Review of Economic Evaluations Reporting the Cost-Effectiveness of Spinal Cord Stimulation","Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a recognized treatment for chronic pain. This systematic review aims to assess economic evaluations of SCS for the management of all chronic pain conditions, summarize key findings, and assess the quality of studies to inform healthcare resource allocation decisions and future research. Economic evaluations were identified by searching general medical and economic databases complemented with screening of reference lists of identified studies. No restrictions on language or treatment comparators were applied. Relevant data were extracted. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were judged to be of acceptable quality. Economic evaluations assessed SCS for the management of refractory angina pectoris, failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), and peripheral arterial disease. Model-based studies typically applied a 2-stage model, i.e. decision tree followed by Markov model. Time horizon varied from 1 year to lifetime. Cost-effectiveness ranged widely from dominant (SCS cost-saving and more effective) to incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of &gt;Ã‚Â£100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Cost-effectiveness appeared to depend on the time horizon, choice of comparator, and indication. Ten of the studies indicated SCS as cost-saving or cost-effective compared with the alternative strategies. The results consistently suggest that SCS is cost-effective when considering a long-term time horizon, particularly for the management of FBSS and CRPS. Further studies are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of SCS for ischemic pain and DPN.","Niyomsri, Duarte, Eldabe, Fiore, Kopell, McNicol, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.02.005","20200828","chronic pain; full economic evaluations; spinal cord stimulation; systematic review; Chronic Pain; Complex Regional Pain Syndromes; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Failed Back Surgery Syndrome; Humans; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Spinal Cord Stimulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16844,""
"Predicting Patient-Centered Outcomes from Spine Surgery Using Risk Assessment Tools: a Systematic Review","The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the current literature in patients undergoing spine surgery in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine to determine the available risk assessment tools to predict the patient-centered outcomes of pain, disability, physical function, quality of life, psychological disposition, and return to work after surgery. Risk assessment tools can assist surgeons and other healthcare providers in identifying the benefit-risk ratio of surgical candidates. These tools gather demographic, medical history, and other pertinent patient-reported measures to calculate a probability utilizing regression or machine learning statistical foundations. Currently, much is still unknown about the use of these tools to predict quality of life, disability, and other factors following spine surgery. A systematic review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines that identified risk assessment tools that utilized patient-reported outcome measures as part of the calculation. From 8128 identified studies, 13 articles met inclusion criteria and were accepted into this review. The range of c-index values reported in the studies was between 0.63 and 0.84, indicating fair to excellent model performance. Post-surgical patient-reported outcomes were identified in the following categories (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â total number of predictive models): return to work (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3), pain (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 9), physical functioning and disability (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5), quality of life (QOL) (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6), and psychosocial disposition (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2).

"Using word embeddings to improve the privacy of clinical notes","In this work, we introduce a privacy technique for anonymizing clinical notes that guarantees all private health information is secured (including sensitive data, such as family history, that are not adequately covered by current techniques). We employ a new &quot;random replacement&quot; paradigm (replacing each token in clinical notes with neighboring word vectors from the embedding space) to achieve 100% recall on the removal of sensitive information, unachievable with current &quot;search-and-secure&quot; paradigms. We demonstrate the utility of this paradigm on multiple corpora in a diverse set of classification tasks. We empirically evaluate the effect of our anonymization technique both on upstream and downstream natural language processing tasks to show that our perturbations, while increasing security (ie, achieving 100% recall on any dataset), do not greatly impact the results of end-to-end machine learning approaches. As long as current approaches utilize precision and recall to evaluate deidentification algorithms, there will remain a risk of overlooking sensitive information. Inspired by differential privacy, we sought to make it statistically infeasible to recreate the original data, although at the cost of readability. We hope that the work will serve as a catalyst to further research into alternative deidentification methods that can address current weaknesses. Our proposed technique can secure clinical texts at a low cost and extremely high recall with a readability trade-off while remaining useful for natural language processing classification tasks. We hope that our work can be used by risk-averse data holders to release clinical texts to researchers.","Abdalla, Abdalla, Rudzicz, Hirst","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa038","20200630"," : privacy; data anonymization; natural language processing; personal health records","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16846,""
"Maximizing the use of social and behavioural information from secondary care mental health electronic health records","The contribution of social and behavioural factors in the development of mental health conditions and treatment effectiveness is widely supported, yet there are weak population level data sources on social and behavioural determinants of mental health. Enriching these data gaps will be crucial to accelerating precision medicine. Some have suggested the broader use of electronic health records (EHR) as a source of non-clinical determinants, although social and behavioural information are not systematically collected metrics in EHRs, internationally. In this commentary, we highlight the nature and quality of key available structured and unstructured social and behavioural data using a case example of value counts from secondary mental health data available in the UK from the UK Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) database; highlight the methodological challenges in the use of such data; and possible solutions and opportunities involving the use of natural language processing (NLP) of unstructured EHR text. Most structured non-clinical data fields within secondary care mental health EHR data have too much missing data for adequate use. The utility of other non-clinical fields reported semi-consistently (e.g., ethnicity and marital status) is entirely dependent on treating them appropriately in analyses, quantifying the many reasons behind missingness in consideration of selection biases. Advancements in NLP offer new opportunities in the exploitation of unstructured text from secondary care EHR data particularly given that clinical notes and attachments are available in large volumes of patients and are more routinely completed by clinicians. Tackling ways to re-use, harmonize, and improve our existing and future secondary care mental health data, leveraging advanced analytics such as NLP is worth the effort in an attempt to fill the data gap on social and behavioural contributors to mental health conditions and will be necessary to fulfill all of the domains needed to inform personalized interventions.","Goodday, Kormilitzin, Vaci, Liu, Cipriani, Smith, Nevado-Holgado","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103429","20200720","Data quality; Electronic health records; Mental health; Natural language processing; Precision medicine; Selection bias","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16847,""
"Estimating Time to Progression of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Tolerance","We defined tolerance range as the distance of observing similar disease conditions or functional status from the upper to the lower boundaries of a specified time interval. A tolerance range was identified for linear regression and support vector machines to optimize the improvement rate (defined as IR) on accuracy in predicting mortality risk in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using clinical notes. The corpus includes pulmonary, cardiology, and radiology reports of 15,500 patients who died between 2011 and 2017. Their performance was compared against a long short-term memory recurrent neural network. The results demonstrate an overall improvement by those basic machine learning approaches after considering an optimal tolerance range: the average IR of linear regression was 90.1% and the maximum IR of support vector machines was 66.2%. There was a similitude between the time segments produced by our tolerance algorithms and those produced by the long short-term memory.","Tang, Plasek, Shi, Wan, Zhang, Kang, Wang, Dulgarian, Xiong, Ma, Bates, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.2992259","20200805","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16848,""
"Limited evidence of benefits of patient operated intelligent primary care triage tools: findings of a literature review","There is consistent evidence that the workload in general practices is substantially increasing. The digitalisation of healthcare including the use of artificial intelligence has been suggested as a solution to this problem. We wanted to explore the features of intelligent online triage tools in primary care by conducting a literature review. A systematic literature search strategy was formulated and conducted in the PubMed database and the Cochrane Library. Articles were selected according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results and data were systematically extracted and thematically analysed. 17 articles of that reported large multimethod studies or smaller diagnostic accuracy tests on clinical vignettes were included. Reviews and expert opinions were also considered. There was limited evidence on the actual effects and performance of triage tools in primary care. Several aspects can guide further development: concepts of system design, system implementation and diagnostic performance. The most important findings were: a need to formulate evaluation guidelines and regulations; their assumed potential has not yet been met; a risk of increased or redistribution of workloads and the available symptom checker systems seem overly risk averse and should be tested in real-life settings. This review identified several features associated with the design and implementation of intelligent online triage tools in a primary care context, although most of the investigated systems seemed underdeveloped and offered limited benefits. Current online triage systems should not be used by individuals who have reasonable access to traditional healthcare. Systems used should be strictly evaluated and regulated like other medical products.","Gottliebsen, Petersson","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjhci-2019-100114","20201001","healthcare; information systems; medical informatics; primary health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16849,""

Qualitative inquiry into user tasks and goals, a structured data model, and an innovative natural language processing pipeline were used to guide design.

"Digital conversations about suicide among teenagers and adults with epilepsy: A big-data, machine learning analysis","Digital media conversations can provide important insight into the concerns and struggles of people with epilepsy (PWE) outside of formal clinical settings and help generate useful information for treatment planning. Our study aimed to explore the big data from open-source digital conversations among PWE with regard to suicidality, specifically comparing teenagers and adults, using machine learning technology. Advanced machine-learning empowered methodology was used to mine and structure open-source digital conversations of self-identifying teenagers and adults who endorsed suffering from epilepsy and engaged in conversation about suicide. The search was limited to 12Ã‚Â months and included only conversations originating from US internet protocol (IP) addresses. Natural language processing and text analytics were employed to develop a thematic analysis. A total of 222Ã‚Â 000 unique conversations about epilepsy, including 9000 (4%) related to suicide, were posted during the study period. The suicide-related conversations were posted by 7.8% of teenagers and 3.2% of adults in the study. Several critical differences were noted between teenagers and adults. A higher percentage of teenagers are: fearful of &quot;the unknown&quot; due to seizures (63% vs 12% adults), concerned about social consequences of seizures (30% vs 21%), and seek emotional support (29% vs 19%). In contrast, a significantly higher percentage of adults show a defeatist (&quot;given up&quot;) attitude compared to teenagers (42% vs 4%). There were important differences in the author's determined sentiments behind the conversations among teenagers and adults. In this first of its kind big data analysis of nearly a quarter-million digital conversations about epilepsy using machine learning, we found that teenagers engage in an online conversation about suicide more often than adults. There are some key differences in the attitudes and concerns, which may have implications for the treatment of younger patients with epilepsy.","Falcone, Dagar, Castilla-Puentes, Anand, Brethenoux, Valleta, Furey, Timmons-Mitchell, Pestana-Knight","https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.16507","20200729","big data; epilepsy; machine learning; social media; suicide; teenagers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16851,""
"[From external assessment of pain to automated multimodal measurement of pain intensity : Narrative review of state of research and clinical perspectives]","In patients with limited communication skills, the use of conventional scales or external assessment is only possible to aÃ‚Â limited extent or not at all.

AÃ‚Â selective literature review with special consideration of recognition rates of automated multimodal pain measurement yielded 14Ã‚Â studies, which are the focus of this review. The variance in recognition rates was 52.9-55.0% (pain threshold) and 66.8-85.7%; in nine studies the recognition rate was Ã¢â€°Â¥80% (pain tolerance), while one study reported recognition rates of 79.3% (pain threshold) and 90.9% (pain tolerance). Pain is generally recorded multimodally, based on external observation scales. With regard to automated pain recognition and on the basis of the 14Ã‚Â selected studies, there is to date no conclusive evidence that multimodal automated pain recognition is superior to unimodal pain recognition.

In the case of one modality not being available, e.g., electrodermal activity in hand burns, the algorithm could use other modalities (video) and thus compensate for missing information.","Frisch, Werner, Al-Hamadi, Traue, Gruss, Walter","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00482-020-00473-x","20200928","Automated pain recognition; External observation; Fusion; Multimodality; Narrative review; Pain recognition; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Pain; Pain Measurement; Pain Threshold","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16852,""
"Advantages and limitations of implant surgery with CAD/CAM surgical guides: A literature review","The purpose of this study is to review the available literature associated with implant surgery using computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) surgical guides and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this advanced technique. An electronic literature search was conducted in the PubMed database for the relevant information on implant placement with CAD/CAM surgical guides. This review was constructed following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Articles were limited to those published within the past 10 years and in the English language. Only clinical studies were included. Inclusion criteria were: studies including 10 implants or more and studies presenting angular deviations in degrees and linear deviations in millimeter. Observational studies, reviews, animal studies, in vitro studies, case reports, simulation studies were excluded. Nine articles were included for qualitative synthesis. The initial search detected 61 articles, and after screening abstracts, a total of 15 articles were selected for full-text review. After the full-text analysis of the 15 articles, six articles were excluded as they did not meet inclusion criteria for study design, study population, and implant placement with data presentation for angular and linear deviations. Ultimately, nine articles providing angular and linear deviations between planned and actual placed implants were used in this review. Common problems that may be encountered by clinicians were listed, and recommendations were made on how to avoid those problems. It has been suggested that although unrealistic expectations are often associated with implant placement with CAD/CAM surgical guides, there is no impeccable accuracy in the clinic. This review demonstrated that the practitioners should be aware of the angular and linear deviations up to 5 Ã‚Â° and 2.3 mm. Therefore, inexperienced dentists should obtain adequate training and be familiar with the basic steps with CAD/CAM surgical guides to avoid complications. <b>Key words:</b>CAD/CAM, CBCT, implant, stereolithography, surgical guide.","Unsal, Turkyilmaz, Lakhia","https://doi.org/10.4317/jced.55871","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16853,""
"Artificial intelligence techniques in asthma: a systematic review and critical appraisal of the existing literature","Artificial intelligence (AI) when coupled with large amounts of well characterised data can yield models that are expected to facilitate clinical practice and contribute to the delivery of better care, especially in chronic diseases such as asthma.The purpose of this paper is to review the utilisation of AI techniques in all aspects of asthma research, <i>i.e.</i> from asthma screening and diagnosis, to patient classification and the overall asthma management and treatment, in order to identify trends, draw conclusions and discover potential gaps in the literature.We conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed and DBLP from 1988 up to 2019, yielding 425 articles; after removing duplicate and irrelevant articles, 98 were further selected for detailed review.The resulting articles were organised in four categories, and subsequently compared based on a set of qualitative and quantitative factors. Overall, we observed an increasing adoption of AI techniques for asthma research, especially within the last decade.AI is a scientific field that is in the spotlight, especially the last decade.

"Association between antipsychotic drug dose and length of clinical notes: a proxy of disease severity?","Most structured clinical data, such as diagnosis codes, are not sufficient to obtain precise phenotypes and assess disease burden. Text mining of clinical notes could provide a basis for detailed profiles of phenotypic traits. The objective of the current study was to determine whether drug dose, regardless of polypharmacy, is associated with the length of clinical notes, and to determine the frequency of adverse events per word in clinical notes. In this observational study, we utilized restricted-access data from an electronic patient record system. Using three methods (defined daily dose, olanzapine equivalents, and chlorpromazine equivalents) we calculated antipsychotic dose equivalents and compared these with the number of words recorded per treatment day. For each normalization method, the frequencies of adverse events per word in manually curated samples were compared to dose intervals. The length of clinical notes per treatment day was positively associated with the prescribed dose for all normalization methods. The number of adverse events per word was stable over the analyzed dose spectrum. Assuming that drug dose increases with the severity of disease, the length of clinical notes can serve as a proxy for disease severity. Due to the near-linear relationship, correction of daily word count is unnecessary when text mining for potential adverse drug reactions.","SÃƒÂ¸rup, Brunak, Eriksson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-00993-1","20200514","Adverse event; Antipsychotic drugs; Natural language processing; Text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16855,""
"The influence of orthognathic surgery on the perception of personality traits: A scoping review","The purpose of this scoping review was to determine the current state of evidence regarding the influence of orthognathic surgery on the perception of personality traits in dysmorphic patients by laypersons.

A qualitative and quantitative synthesis of the results was performed. Descriptive statistics were used. The PRISMA-ScR guidelines were followed. Five studies, published between 2012 and 2018, remained after screening. Seventy-two dysmorphic patients and 12 class I control individuals were rated based on a total of 296 pre- and postoperative photographs or videos. The available data showed concordant results. Dysgnathic patients were more negatively perceived than class I patients for both aesthetic and personality dimensions. Compared to control class I patients, class II patients were perceived as more flexible, less confident, and less intelligent, whereas class III patients were characterized by dominance, aggressivity, and brutality. Dysgnathic patients showed an improvement in the postoperative ratings but did not reach the ratings attributed to the control class I group in most traits evaluated. This added understanding should help surgeons to counsel their patients in a realistic and reasonable manner.","Mugnier, Ibrahim, Bouletreau, Sigaux","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijom.2020.03.017","20201027","Aesthetics; Artificial intelligence; Attractivity; Beauty; Crowdsourcing; Emotions; Face; Facial expression; Intelligence; Malocclusion angle class II; Malocclusion angle class III; Morphopsychology; Orthognathic surgery; Orthognathic surgical procedures; Outcome assessment; Personality traits; Psychology; Psychosocial; Social perception; Esthetics, Dental; Facial Bones; Humans; Malocclusion, Angle Class III; Orthognathic Surgery; Orthognathic Surgical Procedures; Personality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16856,""
"Tripartite-GAN: Synthesizing liver contrast-enhanced MRI to improve tumor detection","Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CEMRI) is crucial for the diagnosis of patients with liver tumors, especially for the detection of benign tumors and malignant tumors. However, it suffers from high-risk, time-consuming, and expensive in current clinical diagnosis due to the use of the gadolinium-based contrast agent (CA) injection. If the CEMRI can be synthesized without CA injection, there is no doubt that it will greatly optimize the diagnosis. In this study, we propose a Tripartite Generative Adversarial Network (Tripartite-GAN) as a non-invasive, time-saving, and inexpensive clinical tool by synthesizing CEMRI to detect tumors without CA injection. Specifically, our innovative Tripartite-GAN combines three associated-networks (an attention-aware generator, a convolutional neural network-based discriminator, and a region-based convolutional neural network-based detector) for the first time, which achieves CEMRI synthesis and tumor detection promoting each other in an end-to-end framework. The generator facilitates detector for accurate tumor detection via synthesizing tumor-specific CEMRI. The detector promotes the generator for accurate CEMRI synthesis via the back-propagation. In order to synthesize CEMRI of equivalent clinical value to real CEMRI, the attention-aware generator expands the receptive field via hybrid convolution, and enhances feature representation and context learning of multi-class liver MRI via dual attention mechanism, and improves the performance of convergence of loss via residual learning. Moreover, the attention maps obtained from the generator newly added into the detector improve the performance of tumor detection. The discriminator promotes the generator to synthesize high-quality CEMRI via the adversarial learning strategy. This framework is tested on a large corpus of axial T1 FS Pre-Contrast MRI and axial T1 FS Delay MRI of 265 subjects. Experimental results and quantitative evaluation demonstrate that the Tripartite-GAN achieves high-quality CEMRI synthesis that peak signal-to-noise rate of 28.8 and accurate tumor detection that accuracy of 89.4%, which reveals that Tripartite-GAN can aid in the clinical diagnosis of liver tumors.","Zhao, Li, Kassam, Howey, Chong, Chen, Li","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101667","20200716","Contrast-enhanced MRI synthesis; Dual attention module; Tripartite-GAN; Tumor detection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16857,""
"Delivering Benefits at Speed Through Real-World Repurposing of Off-Patent Drugs: The COVID-19 Pandemic as a Case in Point","Real-world drug repurposing-the immediate &quot;off-label&quot; prescribing of drugs to address urgent clinical needs-is a widely overlooked opportunity. Off-label prescribing (ie, for a nonapproved indication) is legal in most countries and tends to shift the burden of liability and cost to physicians and patients, respectively. Nevertheless, health crises may mean that real-world repurposing is the only realistic source for solutions. Optimal real-world repurposing requires a track record of safety, affordability, and access for drug candidates. Although thousands of such drugs are already available, there is no central repository of off-label uses to facilitate immediate identification and selection of potentially useful interventions during public health crises. Using the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic as an example, we provide a glimpse of the extensive literature that supports the rationale behind six generic drugs, in four classes, all of which are affordable, supported by decades of safety data, and targeted toward the underlying pathophysiology that makes COVID-19 so deadly. This paper briefly summarizes why cimetidine or famotidine, dipyridamole, fenofibrate or bezafibrate, and sildenafil citrate are worth considering for patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials to assess efficacy are already underway for famotidine, dipyridamole, and sildenafil, and further trials of all these agents will be important in due course. These examples also reveal the unlimited opportunity to future-proof our health care systems by proactively mining, synthesizing, cataloging, and evaluating the off-label treatment opportunities of thousands of safe, well-established, and affordable generic drugs.","Rogosnitzky, Berkowitz, Jadad","https://doi.org/10.2196/19199","20200526","COVID-19; crisis; drug costs; drug repositioning; drugs, generic; off-label use; pandemic; public health; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Costs; Drug Repositioning; Drugs, Generic; Humans; Off-Label Use; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16858,""

"Electron Density and Biologically Effective Dose (BED) Radiomics-Based Machine Learning Models to Predict Late Radiation-Induced Subcutaneous Fibrosis","<b>Purpose:</b> to predict the occurrence of late subcutaneous radiation induced fibrosis (RIF) after partial breast irradiation (PBI) for breast carcinoma by using machine learning (ML) models and radiomic features from 3D Biologically Effective Dose (3D-BED) and Relative Electron Density (3D-RED). <b>Methods:</b> 165 patients underwent external PBI following a hypo-fractionation protocol consisting of 40 Gy/10 fractions, 35 Gy/7 fractions, and 28 Gy/4 fractions, for 73, 60, and 32 patients, respectively. Physicians evaluated toxicity at regular intervals by the Common Terminology Adverse Events (CTAE) version 4.0. RIF was assessed every 3 months after the completion of radiation course and scored prospectively. RIF was experienced by 41 (24.8%) patients after average 5 years of follow up. The Hounsfield Units (HU) of the CT-images were converted into relative electron density (3D-RED) and Dose maps into Biologically Effective Dose (3D-BED), respectively. Shape, first-order and textural features of 3D-RED and 3D-BED were calculated in the planning target volume (PTV) and breast. Clinical and demographic variables were also considered (954 features in total). Imbalance of the dataset was addressed by data augmentation using ADASYN technique. A subset of non-redundant features that best predict the data was identified by sequential feature selection. Support Vector Machines (SVM), ensemble machine learning (EML) using various aggregation algorithms and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers were trained on patient dataset to predict RIF occurrence. Models were assessed using sensitivity and specificity of the ML classifiers and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of the score functions in repeated 5-fold cross validation on the augmented dataset. <b>Results:</b> The SVM model with seven features was preferred for RIF prediction and scored sensitivity 0.83 (95% CI 0.80-0.86), specificity 0.75 (95% CI 0.71-0.77) and AUC of the score function 0.86 (0.85-0.88) on cross-validation. The selected features included cluster shade and Run Length Non-uniformity of breast 3D-BED, kurtosis and cluster shade from PTV 3D-RED, and 10th percentile of PTV 3D-BED. <b>Conclusion:</b> Textures extracted from 3D-BED and 3D-RED in the breast and PTV can predict late RIF and may help better select patient candidates to exclusive PBI.","Avanzo, Pirrone, Vinante, Caroli, Stancanello, Drigo, Massarut, Mileto, Urbani, Trovo, El Naqa, De Paoli, Sartor","https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.00490","20200928","breast cancer; fibrosis; machine learning; radiomics; radiotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16860,""
"The Impact of Alexithymia on Treatment Response in Psychiatric Disorders: A Systematic Review","Treatment of psychiatric disorders relies heavily on a trial and error approach, often prolonging the time required to obtain symptomatic improvements. The identification of reliable predictors of treatment response is instrumental to enact an individualized approach. Alexithymia represents a personality trait reflecting an intrinsic difficulty in recognizing the emotional components of subjective experiences. Thus, its modulating role on treatment outcome has gathered substantial attention during the past years. In the present paper, we aimed at exploring the available evidence for Alexithymia role in influencing the treatment outcome on a wide range of psychiatric conditions by means of a systematic review. We performed a systematic review in Medline and Scopus, augmented by tracking the reference list of the pertinent articles. To be included in this review, research studies had to assess alexithymia impact on a treatment intervention delivered to manage a primary psychiatric disorder. After removing duplicates, titles were screened first, then abstracts, and last full texts were read, eventually leading to the inclusion or exclusion of the papers according to the criteria established before the online search. Then results of the search were downloaded in.xml format and uploaded in Rayyan, a free web software, that helps expedite the initial screening of abstracts and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating a high level of usability. After uploading, screening of the literature was performed in blind by two investigators. Disagreement between reviewers was resolved by joint discussion with a third senior investigator. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Thereafter, the data considered relevant was extracted and synthetized in this paper. Our search yielded a total of 30 articles dealing with a wide range of psychiatric conditions and exploring both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Several lines of evidence suggest a complex role for alexithymia in influencing the psychiatric treatment outcome, further underscoring the need for additional research in this area to better address the existing knowledge gaps.","Pinna, Manchia, Paribello, Carpiniello","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00311","20200928","depression; eating disorders; longitudinal; personality disorders; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16861,""
"Current Evidence on Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Celiac Disease: Systematic Review","Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disease that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals in whom the ingestion of gluten leads to damage of the small bowel. It is estimated to affect 1 in 100 people worldwide, but is severely underdiagnosed. Currently available guidelines require CD-specific serology and atrophic histology in duodenal biopsy samples for the diagnosis of adult CD. In pediatric CD, but in recent years in adults also, nonbioptic diagnostic strategies have become increasingly popular. In this setting, in order to increase the diagnostic rate of this pathology, endoscopy itself has been thought of as a case finding strategy by use of digital image processing techniques. Research focused on computer aided decision support used as database video capsule, endoscopy and even biopsy duodenal images. Early automated methods for diagnosis of celiac disease used feature extraction methods like spatial domain features, transform domain features, scale-invariant features and spatio-temporal features. Recent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques using deep learning (DL) methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machines (SVM) or Bayesian inference have emerged as a breakthrough computer technology which can be used for computer aided diagnosis of celiac disease. In the current review we summarize methods used in clinical studies for classification of CD from feature extraction methods to AI techniques.","Molder, Balaban, Jinga, Molder","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.00341","20200928","artificial intelligence; celiac disease; computer aided diagnosis; endoscopy; feature extraction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16862,""
"Assessment of the opportunities for increasing the availability of EU data on consumer product-related injuries","The availability of data on consumer products-related accidents and injuries is of interest to a wide range of stakeholders, such as consumer product safety and injury prevention policymakers, market surveillance authorities, consumer organisations, standardisation organisations, manufacturers and the public. While the amount of information available and potentially of use for product safety is considerable in some European Union (EU) countries, its usability at EU level is difficult due to high fragmentation of the data sources, the diversity of data collection methods and increasing data protection concerns. To satisfy the policy need for more timely information on consumer product-related incidents, apart from injury data that have been historically collected by the public health sector, a number of 'alternative' data sources were assessed as potential sources of interest. This study explores the opportunities for enhancing the availability of data of consumer product-related injuries, arising from selected existing and 'alternative' data sources, widely present in Europe, such as firefighters' and poison centres' records, mortality statistics, consumer complaints, insurance companies' registers, manufacturers' incident registers and online news sources. These data sources, coupled with the use of IT technologies, such as interlinking by remote data access, could fill in the existing information gap. Strengths and weaknesses of selected data sources, with a view to support a common data platform, are evaluated and presented. Conducting the study relied on the literature review, extensive use of the surveys, interviews, workshops with experts and online data-mining pilot study.","Radovnikovic, Geiss, Kephalopoulos, Reina, Barrero, Dalla Costa, Verile, Mantica","https://doi.org/10.1136/injuryprev-2020-043677","20200930","policy; policy analysis; qualitative research; registry; surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16863,""
"Library of deep-learning image segmentation and outcomes model-implementations","An open-source library of implementations for deep-learning-based image segmentation and outcomes models based on radiotherapy and radiomics is presented. As oncology treatment planning becomes increasingly driven by automation, such a library of model implementations is crucial to (i) validate existing models on datasets collected at different institutions, (ii) automate segmentation, (iii) create ensembles for improving performance and (iv) incorporate validated models in the clinical workflow. Inclusion of deep-learning-based image segmentation and outcomes models in the same library provides a fully automated and reproduceable pipeline to estimate prognosis. The library was developed with the Computational Environment for Radiological Research (CERR) software platform. Centralizing model implementations in CERR builds upon its rich set of radiotherapy and radiomics tools and caters to the world-wide user base. CERR provides well-validated feature extraction pipelines for radiotherapy dosimetry and radiomics with fine control over the calculation settings, allowing users to select appropriate parameters used in model derivation. Models for automatic image segmentation are distributed via containers, allowing them to be deployed with a variety of scientific computing architectures. The library includes implementations of popular DVH-based models outlined in the Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic effort and recently published literature. Radiomics models include features from the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative and application-specific features found to be relevant across multiple sites and image modalities. The library is distributed as a module within CERR at https://www.github.com/cerr/CERR under the GNU-GPL copyleft with additional restrictions on clinical and commercial use and provision to dual license in future.","Apte, Iyer, Thor, Pandya, Haq, Jiang, LoCastro, Shukla-Dave, Sasankan, Xiao, Hu, Elguindi, Veeraraghavan, Oh, Jackson, Deasy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2020.04.011","20201016","Deep-learning; Image segmentation; Library; Model implementations; Normal tissue complication; Radiomics; Radiotherapy outcomes; Tumor control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16864,""

The training adopts distributed selective stochastic gradient descent (ie, it works by exchanging local learning results achieved on private data sets). Five networks were trained on separated real-world clinical data sets by using the privacy-protecting protocol. In total, the data sets contain 1304 real longitudinal patient records for 296 patients. These networks reached a mean F1 value of 0.955. The gold standard centralized training that is based on the union of all sets and does not take data security into consideration reaches a final value of 0.962.

"Phenotate: crowdsourcing phenotype annotations as exercises in undergraduate classes","Computational documentation of genetic disorders is highly reliant on structured data for differential diagnosis, pathogenic variant identification, and patient matchmaking. However, most information on rare diseases (RDs) exists in freeform text, such as academic literature. To increase availability of structured RD data, we developed a crowdsourcing approach for collecting phenotype information using student assignments. We developed Phenotate, a web application for crowdsourcing disease phenotype annotations through assignments for undergraduate genetics students. Using student-collected data, we generated composite annotations for each disease through a machine learning approach. These annotations were compared with those from clinical practitioners and gold standard curated data. Deploying Phenotate in five undergraduate genetics courses, we collected annotations for 22 diseases. Student-sourced annotations showed strong similarity to gold standards, with F-measures ranging from 0.584 to 0.868. Furthermore, clinicians used Phenotate annotations to identify diseases with comparable accuracy to other annotation sources and gold standards. For six disorders, no gold standards were available, allowing us to create some of the first structured annotations for them, while students demonstrated ability to research RDs. Phenotate enables crowdsourcing RD phenotypic annotations through educational assignments. Presented as an intuitive web-based tool, it offers pedagogical benefits and augments the computable RD knowledgebase.","Chang, Mashouri, Lozano, Johnstone, HusiÃ„â€¡, Olry, Maiella, Balci, Sawyer, Robinson, Rath, Brudno","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-020-0812-7","20200803","crowdsourcing; machine learning; medical education; phenotype; rare diseases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16866,""

"Integrated Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Models for Standardizing Radiotherapy Structure Names","The lack of standardized structure names in radiotherapy (RT) data limits interoperability, data sharing, and the ability to perform big data analysis. To standardize radiotherapy structure names, we developed an integrated natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) based system that can map the physician-given structure names to American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 263 (TG-263) standard names. The dataset consist of 794 prostate and 754 lung cancer patients across the 40 different radiation therapy centers managed by the Veterans Health Administration (VA). Additionally, data from the Radiation Oncology department at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) was collected to serve as a test set. Domain experts identified as anatomically significant nine prostate and ten lung organs-at-risk (OAR) structures and manually labeled them according to the TG-263 standards, and remaining structures were labeled as Non_OAR. We experimented with six different classification algorithms and three feature vector methods, and the final model was built with fastText algorithm. Multiple validation techniques are used to assess the robustness of the proposed methodology. The macro-averaged F 1 score was used as the main evaluation metric. The model achieved an F 1 score of 0.97 on prostate structures and 0.99 for lung structures from the VA dataset. The model also performed well on the test (VCU) dataset, achieving an F 1 score of 0.93 for prostate structures and 0.95 on lung structures. In this work, we demonstrate that NLP and ML based approaches can used to standardize the physician-given RT structure names with high fidelity. This standardization can help with big data analytics in the radiation therapy domain using population-derived datasets, including standardization of the treatment planning process, clinical decision support systems, treatment quality improvement programs, and hypothesis-driven clinical research.","Syed, Iv, Ivey, Hagan, Palta, Kapoor, Ghosh","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8020120","20200928","TG-263; machine learning; natural language processing; nomenclature standardization; quality assurance; radiotherapy structure names; text categorization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16868,""
"Evaluating critical success factors in implementing E-learning system using multi-criteria decision-making","Learning using the Internet or training through E-Learning is growing rapidly and is increasingly favored over the traditional methods of learning and teaching. This radical shift is directly linked to the revolution in digital computer technology. The revolution propelled by innovation in computer technology has widened the scope of E-Learning and teaching, whereby the process of exchanging information has been made simple, transparent, and effective. The E-Learning system depends on different success factors from diverse points of view such as system, support from the institution, instructor, and student. Thus, the effect of critical success factors (CSFs) on the E-Learning system must be critically analyzed to make it more effective and successful. This current paper employed the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with group decision-making (GDM) and Fuzzy AHP (FAHP) to study the diversified factors from different dimensions of the web-based E-Learning system. The present paper quantified the CSFs along with its dimensions. Five different dimensions and 25 factors associated with the web-based E-Learning system were revealed through the literature review and were analyzed further. Furthermore, the influence of each factor was derived successfully.

"Efficient and Accurate Extracting of Unstructured EHRs on Cancer Therapy Responses for the Development of RECIST Natural Language Processing Tools: Part I, the Corpus","Electronic health records (EHRs) are created primarily for nonresearch purposes; thus, the amounts of data are enormous, and the data are crude, heterogeneous, incomplete, and largely unstructured, presenting challenges to effective analyses for timely, reliable results. Particularly, research dealing with clinical notes relevant to patient care and outcome is seldom conducted, due to the complexity of data extraction and accurate annotation in the past. RECIST is a set of widely accepted research criteria to evaluate tumor response in patients undergoing antineoplastic therapy. The aim for this study was to identify textual sources for RECIST information in EHRs and to develop a corpus of pharmacotherapy and response entities for development of natural language processing tools. We focused on pharmacotherapies and patient responses, using 55,120 medical notes (n = 72 types) in Mayo Clinic's EHRs from 622 randomly selected patients who signed authorization for research. Using the Multidocument Annotation Environment tool, we applied and evaluated predefined keywords, and time interval and note-type filters for identifying RECIST information and established a gold standard data set for patient outcome research. Key words reduced clinical notes to 37,406, and using four note types within 12 months postdiagnosis further reduced the number of notes to 5,005 that were manually annotated, which covered 97.9% of all cases (n = 609 of 622). The resulting data set of 609 cases (n = 503 for training and n = 106 for validation purpose), contains 736 fully annotated, deidentified clinical notes, with pharmacotherapies and four response end points: complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. This resource is readily expandable to specific drugs, regimens, and most solid tumors. We have established a gold standard data set to accommodate development of biomedical informatics tools in accelerating research into antineoplastic therapeutic response.","Li, Luo, Wampfler, Rubinstein, Tiryaki, Ashok, Warner, Xu, Yang","https://doi.org/10.1200/CCI.19.00147","20200925","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16870,""
"A Systematic Review of Methodological Variation in Healthcare Provider Perspective Tuberculosis Costing Papers Conducted in Low- and Middle-Income Settings, Using An Intervention-Standardised Unit Cost Typology","There is a need for easily accessible tuberculosis unit cost data, as well as an understanding of the variability of methods used and reporting standards of that data. The aim of this systematic review was to descriptively review papers reporting tuberculosis unit costs from a healthcareÃ‚Â provider perspective looking at methodological variation; to assess quality using a study quality rating system and machine learning to investigate the indicators of reporting quality; and to identify the data gaps to inform standardised tuberculosis unit cost collection and consistent principles for reporting going forward. We searched grey and published literature in five sources and eight databases, respectively, using search terms linked to cost, tuberculosis and tuberculosis health services including tuberculosis treatment and prevention. For inclusion, the papers needed to contain empirical unit cost estimates for tuberculosis interventions from low- and middle-income countries, with reference years between 1990 and 2018. A total of 21,691 papers were found and screened in a phased manner. Data were extracted from the eligible papers into a detailed Microsoft Excel tool, extensively cleaned and analysed with R software (R Project, Vienna, Austria) using the user interface of RStudio. A study quality rating was applied to the reviewed papers based on the inclusion or omission of a selection of variables and their relative importance. Following this, machine learning using a recursive partitioning method was utilised to construct a classification tree to assess the reporting quality. This systematic review included 103 provider perspective papers with 627 unit costs (costs not presented here) for tuberculosis interventions among a total of 140 variables. The interventions covered were active, passive and intensified case finding; tuberculosis treatment; above-service costs; and tuberculosis prevention. Passive case finding is the detection of tuberculosis cases where individuals self-identify at health facilities; active case finding is detection of cases of those not in health facilities, such as through outreach; and intensified case finding is detection of cases in high-risk populations. There was heterogeneity in some of the reported methods used such cost allocation, amortisation and the use of top-down, bottom-up or mixed approaches to the costing. Uncertainty checking through sensitivity analysis was only reported on by half of the papers (54%), while purposive and convenience sampling was reported by 72% of papers. Machine learning indicated that reporting on 'Intervention' (in particular), 'Urbanicity' and 'Site Sampling', were the most likely indicators of quality of reporting. The largest data gap identified was for tuberculosis vaccination cost data, the Bacillus Calmette-GuÃƒÂ©rin (BCG) vaccine in particular. There is a gap in available unit costs for 12 of 30 high tuberculosis burden countries, as well as for the interventions of above-service costs, tuberculosis prevention, and active and intensified case finding. Variability in the methods and reporting used makes comparison difficult and makes it hard for decision makers to know which unit costs they can trust. The study quality rating system used in this review as well as the classification tree enable focus on specific reporting aspects that should improve variability and increase confidence in unit costs. Researchers should endeavour to be explicit and transparent in how they cost interventions following the principles as laid out in the Global Health Cost Consortium's Reference Case for Estimating the Costs of Global Health Services and Interventions, which in turn will lead to repeatability, comparability and enhanced learning from others.","Cunnama, Gomez, Siapka, Herzel, Hill, Kairu, Levin, Okello, DeCormier Plosky, Garcia Baena, Sweeney, Vassall, Sinanovic","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-020-00910-w","20200908","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16871,""
"Assessment and application of the coherent point drift algorithm to augmented reality surgical navigation for laparoscopic partial nephrectomy","The surface-based registration approach to laparoscopic augmented reality (AR) has clear advantages. Nonrigid point-set registration paves the way for surface-based registration. Among current non-rigid point set registration methods, the coherent point drift (CPD) algorithm is rarely used because of two challenges: (1) volumetric deformation is difficult to predict, and (2) registration from intraoperative visible tissue surface to whole anatomical preoperative model is a &quot;part-to-whole&quot; registration that CPD cannot be applied directly to. We preliminarily applied CPD on surgical navigation for laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN). However, it introduces normalization errors and lacks navigation robustness. This paper presents important advances for more effectively applying CPD to LPN surgical navigation while attempting to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of CPD-based surgical navigation. First, an optimized volumetric deformation (Op-VD) algorithm is proposed to achieve accurate prediction of volume deformation. Then, a projection-based partial selection method is presented to conveniently and robustly apply the CPD to LPN surgical navigation. Finally, kidneys with different deformations in vitro, phantom and in vivo experiments are performed to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of our approach. The average root-mean-square error of volume deformation was refined to 0.84 mm. The mean target registration error (TRE) of the surface and inside markers in the in vitro experiments decreased to 1.51 mm and 1.29 mm, respectively. The robustness and precision of CPD-based navigation were validated in phantom and in vivo experiments, and the mean navigation TRE of the phantom experiments was found to be [Formula: see text] mm. Accurate volumetric deformation and robust navigation results can be achieved in AR navigation of LPN by using surface-based registration with CPD. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods while showing the clinical application potential of CPD. This work has important guiding significance for the application of the CPD in laparoscopic AR.","Zhang, Wang, Zhang, Zhang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02163-6","20200622","Coherent point drift (CPD); Nonrigid registration; Surface-based registration; Surgical navigation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16872,""
"The Effect Of Visual Dual-Tasking Interference On Walking In Healthy Young Adults","Visual dual-task skills are essential for stable ambulation in everyday life such as walking while reading text. Gait analysis in a virtual environment can provide insight into altered walking performance while visual dual-tasking. How visual dual-tasking including cognitive load of reading text and altered optical flow influences walking speed and stability in healthy adults? Also, is there a relationship between the mediolateral centre of mass(CoM) displacement and mediolateral trunk movement? Nineteen able-bodied young adults performed self-selected walking on a treadmill in a virtual environment under the following three conditions; single-task walking, walking while viewing scrolling lines, and walking while reading text scrolling on the screen. Three-dimensional motion analysis was used to measure the effect of dual-tasking on gait velocity, step length, mediolateral CoM displacement, and mediolateral thorax inclination. The effect of visual dual-tasking showed significantly increased walking speed and longer step length compared to single-tasking. The cognitive load of reading text while walking had a significant impact on reduced step length variability and greater mediolateral CoM displacement. This was related to the mediolateral thorax inclination. A visual dual-task influences gait through altered optical flow and a cognitive load effect. Altered optical flow increased walking speed whilst the visual attention to read text affected foot placement and upright trunk posture, together with greater mediolateral CoM displacement. Thus, dual-tasking of reading text in a virtual environment substantially affected walking stability in healthy young people. This paradigm is therefore useful for assessment of walking stability in daily life and in the clinical setting.","Kimura, van Deursen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2020.04.018","20200918","Center of mass; Gait stability; Trunk movement; Virtual reality; Visual Dual-task","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16873,""
"Towards Chinese clinical named entity recognition by dynamic embedding using domain-specific knowledge","The task of electronic medical record named entity recognition (NER) refers to automatically identify all kinds of named entities in the medical record text. Chinese clinical NER remains a major challenge. One of the main reasons is that Chinese word segmentation will lead to the wrong downstream works. Besides, existing methods only use the information of the general field, not consider the knowledge from field of medicine. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic embedding method based on dynamic attention which combines features of both character and word in embedding layer. Domain knowledge is provided by word vector trained by domain dataset. In addition, spatial attention is added to enable the model to obtain more and more effective context encoding information. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Experiments on CCKS2017 and Common dataset shows that the proposed method outperforms the baseline.","Li, Du, Xiang, Li, Ma, Shao, Wang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103435","20200612","Chinese electronic medical record; Domain-specific knowledge; Dynamic embedding; Named entity recognition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16874,""

"Incidental durotomy: predictive risk model and external validation of natural language process identification algorithm","Incidental durotomy is a common complication of elective lumbar spine surgery seen in up to 11% of cases. Prior studies have suggested patient age and body habitus along with a history of prior surgery as being associated with an increased risk of dural tear. To date, no calculator has been developed for quantifying risk. Here, the authors' aim was to identify independent predictors of incidental durotomy, present a novel predictive calculator, and externally validate a novel method to identify incidental durotomies using natural language processing (NLP). The authors retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent elective lumbar spine procedures at a tertiary academic hospital for degenerative pathologies between July 2016 and November 2018. Data were collected regarding surgical details, patient demographic information, and patient medical comorbidities. The primary outcome was incidental durotomy, which was identified both through manual extraction and the NLP algorithm. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of incidental durotomy. Bootstrapping was then employed to estimate optimism in the model, which was corrected for; this model was converted to a calculator and deployed online. Of the 1279 elective lumbar surgery patients included in this study, incidental durotomy occurred in 108 (8.4%). Risk factors for incidental durotomy on multivariable logistic regression were increased surgical duration, older age, revision versus index surgery, and case starts after 4 pm. This model had an area under curve (AUC) of 0.73 in predicting incidental durotomies. The previously established NLP method was used to identify cases of incidental durotomy, of which it demonstrated excellent discrimination (AUC 0.97). Using multivariable analysis, the authors found that increased surgical duration, older patient age, cases started after 4 pm, and a history of prior spine surgery are all independent positive predictors of incidental durotomy in patients undergoing elective lumbar surgery. Additionally, the authors put forth the first version of a clinical calculator for durotomy risk that could be used prospectively by spine surgeons when counseling patients about their surgical risk. Lastly, the authors presented an external validation of an NLP algorithm used to identify incidental durotomies through the review of free-text operative notes. The authors believe that these tools can aid clinicians and researchers in their efforts to prevent this costly complication in spine surgery.","Ehresman, Pennington, Karhade, Huq, Medikonda, Schilling, Feghali, Hersh, Ahmed, Cottrill, Lubelski, Westbroek, Schwab, Sciubba","https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.2.SPINE20127","20200605","ASA = American Society of Anesthesiologists; ASD-S = adult spinal deformityÃ¢â‚¬â€œsurgical; AUC = area under the curve; CCI = Charlson Comorbidity Index; LOS = length of stay; NLP = natural language processing; PRC = precision-recall curve; ROC = receiver operating characteristic; incidental durotomy; intraoperative complication; lumbar spine surgery; natural language processing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16876,""
"Studying physiology within a flipped classroom: The importance of on-campus activities for nursing students' experiences of mastery","To explore the on-campus activities of the flipped classroom and their role in nursing students' experiences of mastering physiology. A nurse must be confident in their knowledge of physiology to feel confident as a nurse. However, many nursing students do not believe in their ability to master physiology. The flipped classroom design could facilitate active learning and promote students' confidence and competence in physiology. A design-based research design was employed. Twenty-three nursing students enrolled in an anatomy and physiology course participated in two focus group interviews and wrote two individual reflective notes. The data were analysed by means of systematic text condensation and activity theory. Reporting was guided by the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies (COREQ). The study findings underscore the importance of careful design of on-campus activities within the flipped classroom to support students' experiences of mastery in physiology. Four themes were identified: (a) preparation which builds a foundation for learning; (b) the use of digital tools; (c) learning through dialogue with peers; and (d) experience of the expected learning outcomes. On-campus learning activities within a flipped classroom design could support students' experiences of confidence in and mastery of physiology. However, the study participants found learner-centred activities challenging and described feeling doubtful of their ability to master physiology. A didactic framework could take into account the circumstance that students perceive educational technology differently. When designing on-campus activities, emphasis should be placed on collaboration rather than competition to help students develop confidence in their knowledge of physiology. It is important to support nursing students' knowledge acquisition in bioscience and their development of confidence as these skills could enhance their clinical judgment in practice. Comprehension of bioscience is necessary to provide safe patient care and competent nursing.","Bingen, Steindal, Krumsvik, Tveit","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15308","20200713","active learning; flipped classroom; mastery; nursing education; physiology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16877,""
"Chinese clinical named entity recognition with variant neural structures based on BERT methods","Clinical Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is a critical task which aims to identify and classify clinical terms in electronic medical records. In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved significant success in CNER. However, these methods require high-quality and large-scale labeled clinical data, which is challenging and expensive to obtain, especially data on Chinese clinical records. To tackle the Chinese CNER task, we pre-train BERT model on the unlabeled Chinese clinical records, which can leverage the unlabeled domain-specific knowledge. Different layers such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Conditional Random Field (CRF) are used to extract the text features and decode the predicted tags respectively. In addition, we propose a new strategy to incorporate dictionary features into the model. Radical features of Chinese characters are used to improve the model performance as well. To the best of our knowledge, our ensemble model outperforms the state of the art models which achieves 89.56% strict F1 score on the CCKS-2018 dataset and 91.60% F1 score on CCKS-2017 dataset.","Li, Zhang, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103422","20200720","BERT; CRF; Clinical named entity recognition; LSTM","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16878,""
"Identifying Predictors of Suicide in Severe Mental Illness: A Feasibility Study of a Clinical Prediction Rule (Oxford Mental Illness and Suicide Tool or OxMIS)","Oxford Mental Illness and Suicide tool (OxMIS) is a brief, scalable, freely available, structured risk assessment tool to assess suicide risk in patients with severe mental illness (schizophrenia-spectrum disorders or bipolar disorder). OxMIS requires further external validation, but a lack of large-scale cohorts with relevant variables makes this challenging. Electronic health records provide possible data sources for external validation of risk prediction tools. However, they contain large amounts of information within free-text that is not readily extractable. In this study, we examined the feasibility of identifying suicide predictors needed to validate OxMIS in routinely collected electronic health records. In study 1, we manually reviewed electronic health records of 57 patients with severe mental illness to calculate OxMIS risk scores. In study 2, we examined the feasibility of using natural language processing to scale up this process. We used anonymized free-text documents from the Clinical Record Interactive Search database to train a named entity recognition model, a machine learning technique which recognizes concepts in free-text. The model identified eight concepts relevant for suicide risk assessment: medication (antidepressant/antipsychotic treatment), violence, education, self-harm, benefits receipt, drug/alcohol use disorder, suicide, and psychiatric admission. We assessed model performance in terms of precision (similar to positive predictive value), recall (similar to sensitivity) and F1 statistic (an overall performance measure). In study 1, we estimated suicide risk for all patients using the OxMIS calculator, giving a range of 12 month risk estimates from 0.1-3.4%. For 13 out of 17 predictors, there was no missing information in electronic health records. For the remaining 4 predictors missingness ranged from 7-26%; to account for these missing variables, it was possible for OxMIS to estimate suicide risk using a range of scores. In study 2, the named entity recognition model had an overall precision of 0.77, recall of 0.90 and F1 score of 0.83. The concept with the best precision and recall was medication (precision 0.84, recall 0.96) and the weakest were suicide (precision 0.37), and drug/alcohol use disorder (recall 0.61). It is feasible to estimate suicide risk with the OxMIS tool using predictors identified in routine clinical records. Predictors could be extracted using natural language processing. However, electronic health records differ from other data sources, particularly for family history variables, which creates methodological challenges.","Senior, Burghart, Yu, Kormilitzin, Liu, Vaci, Nevado-Holgado, Pandit, Zlodre, Fazel","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00268","20200928","OxMIS; bipolar disorder; electronic health records; feasibility; natural language processing; risk assessment; schizophrenia; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16879,""
"Publicly available machine learning models for identifying opioid misuse from the clinical notes of hospitalized patients","Automated de-identification methods for removing protected health information (PHI) from the source notes of the electronic health record (EHR) rely on building systems to recognize mentions of PHI in text, but they remain inadequate at ensuring perfect PHI removal. As an alternative to relying on de-identification systems, we propose the following solutions: (1) Mapping the corpus of documents to standardized medical vocabulary (concept unique identifier [CUI] codes mapped from the Unified Medical Language System) thus eliminating PHI as inputs to a machine learning model; and (2) training character-based machine learning models that obviate the need for a dictionary containing input words/n-grams. We aim to test the performance of models with and without PHI in a use-case for an opioid misuse classifier. An observational cohort sampled from adult hospital inpatient encounters at a health system between 2007 and 2017. A case-control stratified sampling (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1000) was performed to build an annotated dataset for a reference standard of cases and non-cases of opioid misuse. Models for training and testing included CUI codes, character-based, and n-gram features. Models applied were machine learning with neural network and logistic regression as well as expert consensus with a rule-based model for opioid misuse. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) were compared between models for discrimination. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test and visual plots measured model fit and calibration. Machine learning models with CUI codes performed similarly to n-gram models with PHI. The top performing models with AUROCs &gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.90 included CUI codes as inputs to a convolutional neural network, max pooling network, and logistic regression model. The top calibrated models with the best model fit were the CUI-based convolutional neural network and max pooling network. The top weighted CUI codes in logistic regression has the related terms 'Heroin' and 'Victim of abuse'. We demonstrate good test characteristics for an opioid misuse computable phenotype that is void of any PHI and performs similarly to models that use PHI. Herein we share a PHI-free, trained opioid misuse classifier for other researchers and health systems to use and benchmark to overcome privacy and security concerns.","Sharma, Dligach, Swope, Salisbury-Afshar, Karnik, Joyce, Afshar","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-1099-y","20200807","Computable phenotype; Heroin; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Opioid misuse; Opioid use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16880,""
"Distributed representation and one-hot representation fusion with gated network for clinical semantic textual similarity","Semantic textual similarity (STS) is a fundamental natural language processing (NLP) task which can be widely used in many NLP applications such as Question Answer (QA), Information Retrieval (IR), etc. It is a typical regression problem, and almost all STS systems either use distributed representation or one-hot representation to model sentence pairs. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework based on a gated network to fuse distributed representation and one-hot representation of sentence pairs. Some current state-of-the-art distributed representation methods, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory networks (Bi-LSTM) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), were used in our framework, and a system based on this framework was developed for a shared task regarding clinical STS organized by BioCreative/OHNLP in 2018. Compared with the systems only using distributed representation or one-hot representation, our method achieved much higher Pearson correlation. Among all distributed representations, BERT performed best. The highest Person correlation of our system was 0.8541, higher than the best official one of the BioCreative/OHNLP clinical STS shared task in 2018 (0.8328) by 0.0213.

"Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition Using Surface Electromyography and Machine Learning: A Systematic Literature Review","Today, daily life is composed of many computing systems, therefore interacting with them in a natural way makes the communication process more comfortable. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has been developed to overcome the communication barriers between humans and computers. One form of HCI is Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR), which predicts the class and the instant of execution of a given movement of the hand. One possible input for these models is surface electromyography (EMG), which records the electrical activity of skeletal muscles. EMG signals contain information about the intention of movement generated by the human brain. This systematic literature review analyses the state-of-the-art of real-time hand gesture recognition models using EMG data and machine learning. We selected and assessed 65 primary studies following the Kitchenham methodology. Based on a common structure of machine learning-based systems, we analyzed the structure of the proposed models and standardized concepts in regard to the types of models, data acquisition, segmentation, preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, postprocessing, real-time processing, types of gestures, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we also identified trends and gaps that could open new directions of work for future research in the area of gesture recognition using EMG.","Jaramillo-YÃƒÂ¡nez, BenalcÃƒÂ¡zar, Mena-Maldonado","https://doi.org/10.3390/s20092467","20200611","electromyography; hand gesture recognition; humanÃ¢â‚¬â€œcomputer interaction; machine learning; real-time systems; systematic literature review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16882,""
"Machine Learning Classification Algorithms to Predict aGvHD following Allo-HSCT: A Systematic Review","Ã¢â‚¬Æ’The acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) is the most important cause of mortality in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Given that it occurs at the stage of severe tissue damage, its diagnosis is late. With the advancement of machine learning (ML), promising real-time models to predict aGvHD have emerged. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’This article aims to synthesize the literature on ML classification algorithms for predicting aGvHD, highlighting algorithms and important predictor variables used.

The studies with a focus on using the ML classification algorithms in the process of predicting of aGvHD were considered. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 14 studies were selected for evaluation. The results of the current analysis showed that the algorithms used were Artificial Neural Network (79%), Support Vector Machine (50%), Naive Bayes (43%), k-Nearest Neighbors (29%), Regression (29%), and Decision Trees (14%), respectively. Also, many predictor variables have been used in these studies so that we have divided them into more abstract categories, including biomarkers, demographics, infections, clinical, genes, transplants, drugs, and other variables.

"The Development of the Military Service Identification Tool: Identifying Military Veterans in a Clinical Research Database Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning","Electronic health care records (EHRs) are a rich source of health-related information, with potential for secondary research use. In the United Kingdom, there is no national marker for identifying those who have previously served in the Armed Forces, making analysis of the health and well-being of veterans using EHRs difficult. This study aimed to develop a tool to identify veterans from free-text clinical documents recorded in a psychiatric EHR database. Veterans were manually identified using the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) Biomedical Research Centre Clinical Record Interactive Search-a database holding secondary mental health care electronic records for the SLaM National Health Service Foundation Trust. An iterative approach was taken; first, a structured query language (SQL) method was developed, which was then refined using natural language processing and machine learning to create the Military Service Identification Tool (MSIT) to identify if a patient was a civilian or veteran. Performance, defined as correct classification of veterans compared with incorrect classification, was measured using positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, F1 score, and accuracy (otherwise termed Youden Index). A gold standard dataset of 6672 free-text clinical documents was manually annotated by human coders. Of these documents, 66.00% (4470/6672) were then used to train the SQL and MSIT approaches and 34.00% (2202/6672) were used for testing the approaches. To develop the MSIT, an iterative 2-stage approach was undertaken. In the first stage, an SQL method was developed to identify veterans using a keyword rule-based approach. This approach obtained an accuracy of 0.93 in correctly predicting civilians and veterans, a positive predictive value of 0.81, a sensitivity of 0.75, and a negative predictive value of 0.95. This method informed the second stage, which was the development of the MSIT using machine learning, which, when tested, obtained an accuracy of 0.97, a positive predictive value of 0.90, a sensitivity of 0.91, and a negative predictive value of 0.98. The MSIT has the potential to be used in identifying veterans in the United Kingdom from free-text clinical documents, providing new and unique insights into the health and well-being of this population and their use of mental health care services.","Leightley, Pernet, Velupillai, Stewart, Mark, Opie, Murphy, Fear, Stevelink","https://doi.org/10.2196/15852","20200928","electronic health care records; machine learning; mental health; military personnel; natural language processing; veteran","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16885,""
"Use of Smartphones to Detect Diabetic Retinopathy: Scoping Review and Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies","Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a common complication of diabetes mellitus, is the leading cause of impaired vision in adults worldwide. Smartphone ophthalmoscopy involves using a smartphone camera for digital retinal imaging. Utilizing smartphones to detect DR is potentially more affordable, accessible, and easier to use than conventional methods. This study aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of various smartphone ophthalmoscopy approaches for detecting DR in diabetic patients. We performed an electronic search on the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for literature published from January 2000 to November 2018. We included studies involving diabetic patients, which compared the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone ophthalmoscopy for detecting DR to an accurate or commonly employed reference standard, such as indirect ophthalmoscopy, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and tabletop fundus photography. Two reviewers independently screened studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool, with disagreements resolved via consensus. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled using the random effects model. A summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was constructed. This review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies guidelines. In all, nine studies involving 1430 participants were included. Most studies were of high quality, except one study with limited applicability because of its reference standard. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for detecting any DR was 87% (95% CI 74%-94%) and 94% (95% CI 81%-98%); mild nonproliferative DR (NPDR) was 39% (95% CI 10%-79%) and 95% (95% CI 91%-98%); moderate NPDR was 71% (95% CI 57%-81%) and 95% (95% CI 88%-98%); severe NPDR was 80% (95% CI 49%-94%) and 97% (95% CI 88%-99%); proliferative DR (PDR) was 92% (95% CI 79%-97%) and 99% (95% CI 96%-99%); diabetic macular edema was 79% (95% CI 63%-89%) and 93% (95% CI 82%-97%); and referral-warranted DR was 91% (95% CI 86%-94%) and 89% (95% CI 56%-98%). The area under SROC curve ranged from 0.879 to 0.979. The diagnostic odds ratio ranged from 11.3 to 1225. We found heterogeneous evidence showing that smartphone ophthalmoscopy performs well in detecting DR. The diagnostic accuracy for PDR was highest. Future studies should standardize reference criteria and classification criteria and evaluate other available forms of smartphone ophthalmoscopy in primary care settings.","Tan, Kyaw, Smith, Tan, Tudor Car","https://doi.org/10.2196/16658","20200901","artificial intelligence; diabetic retinopathy; mobile phone; ophthalmoscopy; smartphone; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16886,""
"Using the Preparation Phase of the Multiphase Optimization Strategy to Develop a Messaging Component for Weight Loss: Formative and Pilot Research","Mobile messaging is often used in behavioral weight loss interventions, yet little is known as to the extent to which they contribute to weight loss when part of a multicomponent treatment package. The multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) is a framework that researchers can use to systematically investigate interventions that achieve desirable outcomes given specified constraints. This study describes the use of MOST to develop a messaging intervention as a component to test as part of a weight loss treatment package in a subsequent optimization trial. On the basis of our conceptual model, a text message intervention was created to support self-regulation of weight-related behaviors. We tested the messages in the ENLIGHTEN feasibility pilot study. Adults with overweight and obesity were recruited to participate in an 8-week weight loss program. Participants received a commercially available self-monitoring smartphone app, coaching calls, and text messages. The number and frequency of text messages sent were determined by individual preferences, and weight was assessed at 8 weeks. Participants (n=9) in the feasibility pilot study lost 3.2% of their initial body weight over the 8-week intervention and preferred to receive 1.8 texts per day for 4.3 days per week. Researcher burden in manually sending messages was high, and the cost of receiving text messages was a concern. Therefore, a fully automated push notification system was developed to facilitate sending tailored daily messages to participants to support weight loss. Following the completion of specifying the conceptual model and the feasibility pilot study, the message intervention went through a final iteration. Theory and feasibility pilot study results during the preparation phase informed critical decisions about automation, frequency, triggers, and content before inclusion as a treatment component in a factorial optimization trial.

"Open Software/Hardware Platform for Human-Computer Interface Based on Electrooculography (EOG) Signal Classification","Electrooculography (EOG) signals have been widely used in Human-Computer Interfaces (HCI). The HCI systems proposed in the literature make use of self-designed or closed environments, which restrict the number of potential users and applications. Here, we present a system for classifying four directions of eye movements employing EOG signals. The system is based on open source ecosystems, the Raspberry Pi single-board computer, the OpenBCI biosignal acquisition device, and an open-source python library. The designed system provides a cheap, compact, and easy to carry system that can be replicated or modified. We used Maximum, Minimum, and Median trial values as features to create a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. A mean of 90% accuracy was obtained from 7 out of 10 subjects for online classification of Up, Down, Left, and Right movements. This classification system can be used as an input for an HCI, i.e., for assisted communication in paralyzed people.","MartÃƒÂ­nez-CerverÃƒÂ³, Ardali, Jaramillo-Gonzalez, Wu, Tonin, Birbaumer, Chaudhary","https://doi.org/10.3390/s20092443","20200611","Human-Computer Interface (HCI); Support Vector Machine (SVM); electrooculography (EOG)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16888,""
"High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Improves Cardiorespiratory Fitness (CRF) in Healthy, Overweight and Obese Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Controlled Studies","<i>Background</i>: High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is a sustainable and effective method for improving Cardiorespiratory Fitness (CRF) in adolescents. HIIT is proven to produce equal or greater improvements in CRF when compared to moderate intensity continuous exercise (MICE) in adolescents. <i>Methods</i>: The studies included were considered eligible if: (1) Participants were adolescents (11-18 years old); (2) Examined changes in CRF measured either directly or indirectly; (3) Included a non-exercising control group or MICE comparison group; (4) Participants were matched at enrolment; (5) Reported HIIT protocol information; (6) Provided HIIT intensity. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effect of HIIT on CRF. Meta-regression and moderator analyses were performed out to quantitatively examine moderators of protocol design on CRF improvements. <i>Results</i>: HIIT displays a moderate effect to improve CRF (<i>g</i> = 0.86, 95% CI 0.518-1.106, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Neither study duration (weeks), nor total or weekly accumulated HIIT volume (min) displayed any significant moderation effect on pooled improvement on CRF (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). <i>Conclusions</i>: HIIT is an effective method to improve CRF in adolescents, irrespective of body composition. Notably, meta regression analysis identified that prolonged high volume HIIT programs are similarly effective to short term low volume HIIT programs. This becomes of particular interest for those involved in school curricula, where short HIIT exercise may provide a pragmatic adjunct to the health benefits of Physical Education (PE) lessons.","Martin-Smith, Cox, Buchan, Baker, Grace, Sculthorpe","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082955","20200930","adolescents; cardiorespiratory fitness; high intensity interval training; Adolescent; Body Composition; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Child; High-Intensity Interval Training; Humans; Obesity; Overweight","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16889,""
"Can human posture and range of motion be measured automatically by smart mobile applications?","Human posture and Range of Motion (ROM) are important components of a physical assessment and, from the collected data, it is possible to identify postural deviations such as scoliosis or joint and muscle limitations, hence identifying risks of more serious injuries. Posture assessment and ROM measures are also necessary metrics to monitor the effect of treatments used in the motor rehabilitation of patients, as well as to monitor their clinical progress. These evaluation processes are more frequently performed through visual inspection and manual palpation, which are simple and low cost methods. These methods, however, can be optimized with the use of tools such as photogrammetry and goniometry. Mobile solutions have also been developed to help health professionals to capture more objective data and with less risk of bias. Although there are already several systems proposed for assessing human posture and ROM in the literature, they have not been able to automatically identify and mark Anatomical and Segment Points (ASPs). The hypothesis presented here considers the development of a mobile application for automatic identification of ASPs by using machine learning algorithms and computer vision models associated with technologies embedded in smartphones. From ASPs identification, it will be possible to identify changes in postural alignment and ROM. In this context, our view is that an application derived from the hypothesis will serve as an additional tool to assist in the physical assessment process and, consequently, in the diagnosis of disorders related to postural and movement changes.","Moreira, Teles, Fialho, Dos Santos, Vasconcelos, de SÃƒÂ¡, Bastos, Silva, Teixeira","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109741","20200819","Applications; Human postural assessment; Mobile; Spinal misalignment; Wearable devices","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16890,""
"A Knowledge Graph of Combined Drug Therapies Using Semantic Predications From Biomedical Literature: Algorithm Development","Combination therapy plays an important role in the effective treatment of malignant neoplasms and precision medicine. Numerous clinical studies have been carried out to investigate combination drug therapies. Automated knowledge discovery of these combinations and their graphic representation in knowledge graphs will enable pattern recognition and identification of drug combinations used to treat a specific type of cancer, improve drug efficacy and treatment of human disorders. This paper aims to develop an automated, visual approach to discover knowledge about combination therapies from biomedical literature, especially from those studies with high-level evidence such as clinical trial reports and clinical practice guidelines. Based on semantic predications, which consist of a triple structure of subject-predicate-object (SPO), we proposed an automated algorithm to discover knowledge of combination drug therapies using the following rules: 1) two or more semantic predications (S<sub>1</sub>-P-O and S<sub>i</sub>-P-O, i = 2, 3Ã¢â‚¬Â¦) can be extracted from one conclusive claim (sentence) in the abstract of a given publication, and 2) these predications have an identical predicate (that closely relates to human disease treatment, eg, &quot;treat&quot;) and object (eg, disease name) but different subjects (eg, drug names). A customized knowledge graph organizes and visualizes these combinations, improving the traditional semantic triples. After automatic filtering of broad concepts such as &quot;pharmacologic actions&quot; and generic disease names, a set of combination drug therapies were identified and characterized through manual interpretation. We retrieved 22,263 clinical trial reports and 31 clinical practice guidelines from PubMed abstracts by searching &quot;antineoplastic agents&quot; for drug restriction (published between Jan 2009 and Oct 2019). There were 15,603 conclusive claims locally parsed using the search terms &quot;conclusion*&quot; and &quot;conclude*&quot; ready for semantic predications extraction by SemRep, and 325 candidate groups of semantic predications about combined medications were automatically discovered within 316 conclusive claims. Based on manual analysis, we determined that 255/316 claims (78.46%) were accurately identified as describing combination therapies and adopted these to construct the customized knowledge graph. We also identified two categories (and 4 subcategories) to characterize the inaccurate results: limitations of SemRep and limitations of proposal. We further learned the predominant patterns of drug combinations based on mechanism of action for new combined medication studies and discovered 4 obvious markers (&quot;combin*,&quot; &quot;coadministration,&quot; &quot;co-administered,&quot; and &quot;regimen&quot;) to identify potential combination therapies to enable development of a machine learning algorithm. Semantic predications from conclusive claims in the biomedical literature can be used to support automated knowledge discovery and knowledge graph construction for combination therapies. A machine learning approach is warranted to take full advantage of the identified markers and other contextual features.","Du, Li","https://doi.org/10.2196/18323","20200928","combined drug therapy; knowledge discovery; knowledge graph; semantic predications","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16891,""
"Deep learning in gastric tissue diseases: a systematic review","In recent years, deep learning has gained remarkable attention in medical image analysis due to its capacity to provide results comparable to specialists and, in some cases, surpass them. Despite the emergence of deep learning research on gastric tissues diseases, few intensive reviews are addressing this topic. We performed a systematic review related to applications of deep learning in gastric tissue disease analysis by digital histology, endoscopy and radiology images. This review highlighted the high potential and shortcomings in deep learning research studies applied to gastric cancer, ulcer, gastritis and non-malignant diseases. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of gastric tissue analysis by deep learning applications.

"Ependymoma and pilocytic astrocytoma: Differentiation using radiomics approach based on machine learning","Mandatory accurate and specific diagnosis demands have brought about increased challenges for radiologists in pediatric posterior fossa tumor prediction and prognosis. With the development of high-performance computing and machine learning technologies, radiomics provides increasing opportunities for clinical decision-making. Several studies have applied radiomics as a decision support tool in intracranial tumors differentiation. Here we seek to achieve preoperative differentiation between ependymoma (EP) and pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) using radiomics analysis method based on machine learning. A total of 135 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) slices are divided into training sets and validation sets. Three kinds of radiomics features, including Gabor transform, texture and wavelet transform based ones are used to obtain 300 multimodal features. Kruskal-Wallis test score (KWT) and support vector machines (SVM) are applied for feature selection and tumor differentiation. The performance is investigated via accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. Results show that the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of the selected feature set are 0.8775, 0.9292, 0.8000, and 0.8646 respectively, having no significantdifferencescomparedwiththe overall feature set. For different types of features, texture features yield the best differentiation performance and the significance analysis results are consistent with this. Our study demonstrates texture features perform better than the other features. The radiomics approach based on machine learning is efficient for pediatric posterior fossa tumors differentiation and could enhance the application of radiomics methods for assisted clinical diagnosis.","Li, Wang, Shang, Yang, Zhang, Wan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2020.04.080","20200803","Ependymoma; MRI; Machine Learning; Pilocytic Astrocytoma; Radiomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16893,""
"Precise proximal femur fracture classification for interactive training and surgical planning","Demonstrate the feasibility of a fully automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tool, based on deep learning, that localizes and classifies proximal femur fractures on X-ray images according to the AO classification. The proposed framework aims to improve patient treatment planning and provide support for the training of trauma surgeon residents. A database of 1347 clinical radiographic studies was collected. Radiologists and trauma surgeons annotated all fractures with bounding boxes and provided a classification according to the AO standard. In all experiments, the dataset was split patient-wise in three with the ratio 70%:10%:20% to build the training, validation and test sets, respectively. ResNet-50 and AlexNet architectures were implemented as deep learning classification and localization models, respectively. Accuracy, precision, recall and [Formula: see text]-score were reported as classification metrics. Retrieval of similar cases was evaluated in terms of precision and recall. The proposed CAD tool for the classification of radiographs into types &quot;A,&quot; &quot;B&quot; and &quot;not-fractured&quot; reaches a [Formula: see text]-score of 87% and AUC of 0.95. When classifying fractures versus not-fractured cases it improves up to 94% and 0.98. Prior localization of the fracture results in an improvement with respect to full-image classification. In total, 100% of the predicted centers of the region of interest are contained in the manually provided bounding boxes. The system retrieves on average 9 relevant images (from the same class) out of 10 cases. Our CAD scheme localizes, detects and further classifies proximal femur fractures achieving results comparable to expert-level and state-of-the-art performance. Our auxiliary localization model was highly accurate predicting the region of interest in the radiograph. We further investigated several strategies of verification for its adoption into the daily clinical routine.

"Preoperative assessment of lymph node metastasis in Colon Cancer patients using machine learning: a pilot study","Preoperative detection of lymph node (LN) metastasis is critical for planning treatments in colon cancer (CC). The clinical diagnostic criteria based on the size of the LNs are not sensitive to determine metastasis using CT images. In this retrospective study, we investigated the potential value of CT texture features to diagnose LN metastasis using preoperative CT data and patient characteristics by developing quantitative prediction models. A total of 390 CC patients, undergone surgical resection, were enrolled in this monocentric study. 390 histologically validated LNs were collected from patients and randomly separated into training (312 patients, 155 metastatic and 157 normal LNs) and test cohorts (78 patients, 39 metastatic and 39 normal LNs). Six patient characteristics and 146 quantitative CT imaging features were analyzed and key variables were determined using either exhaustive search or least absolute shrinkage algorithm. Two kernel-based support vector machine classifiers (patient-characteristic model and radiomic-derived model), generated with 10-fold cross-validation, were compared with the clinical model that utilizes long-axis diameter for diagnosis of metastatic LN. The performance of the models was evaluated on the test cohort by computing accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). The clinical model had an overall diagnostic accuracy of 64.87%; specifically, accuracy of 65.38% and 62.82%, sensitivity of 83.87% and 84.62%, and specificity of 47.13% and 41.03% for training and test cohorts, respectively. The patient-demographic model obtained accuracy of 67.31% and 73.08%, the sensitivity of 62.58% and 69.23%, and specificity of 71.97% and 76.23% for training and test cohorts, respectively. Besides, the radiomic-derived model resulted in an accuracy of 81.09% and 79.49%, sensitivity of 83.87% and 74.36%, and specificity of 78.34% and 84.62% for training and test cohorts, respectively. Furthermore, the diagnostic performance of the radiomic-derived model was significantly higher than clinical and patient-demographic models (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02) according to the DeLong method. The texture of the LNs provided characteristic information about the histological status of the LNs. The radiomic-derived model leveraging LN texture provides better preoperative diagnostic accuracy for the detection of metastatic LNs compared to the clinically accepted diagnostic criteria and patient-demographic model.","Eresen, Li, Yang, Shangguan, Velichko, Yaghmai, Benson, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40644-020-00308-z","20200910","Colon cancer; Computed tomography; Machine learning; Metastatic lymph node; Texture analysis; Adult; Aged; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Lymphatic Metastasis; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Preoperative Period; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16895,""

Evaluation of the risk of bias was performed using tailored Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted. Of the 45 studies retrieved, 19 studies were included. All studies were retrospective. Deep learning applications for WCE included detection of ulcers, polyps, celiac disease, bleeding, and hookworm. Detection accuracy was above 90% for most studies and diseases. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for ulcer detection were .95 (95% confidence interval [CI], .89-.98) and .94 (95% CI, .90-.96), respectively. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for bleeding or bleeding source were .98 (95% CI, .96-.99) and .99 (95% CI, .97-.99), respectively.

"Machine learning application for incident prostate adenocarcinomas automatic registration in a French regional cancer registry","Cancer registries are collections of curated data about malignant tumor diseases. The amount of data processed by cancer registries increases every year, making manual registration more and more tedious. We sought to develop an automatic analysis pipeline that would be able to identify and preprocess registry input for incident prostate adenocarcinomas in a French regional cancer registry. Notifications from different sources submitted to the Bas-Rhin cancer registry were used here: pathology data and, ICD 10 diagnosis codes from hospital discharge data and healthcare insurance data. We trained a Support Vector Machine model (machine learning) to predict whether patient's data must be considered or not as a prostate adenocarcinoma incident case that should therefore be registered. The final registration of all identified cases was manually confirmed by a specialized technician. Text mining tools (regular expressions) were used to extract clinical and biological data from non-structured pathology reports. We performed two successive analyses. First, we used 982 cases manually labeled by registrars from the 2014 dataset to predict the registration of 785 cases submitted in 2015. Then, we repeated the procedure using the 2089 cases labeled by registrars from the 2014 and 2015 datasets to predict the registration of 926 cases submitted in the 2016 data. The algorithm identified 663 cases of prostate adenocarcinoma in 2015, and 610 in 2016. From these findings, 663 and 531 cases were respectively added to the registry; and 641 and 512 cases were confirmed by the specialized technician. This registration process has achieved a precision level above 96 %. The algorithm obtained an overall precision of 99 % (99.5 % in 2015 and 98.5 % in 2016) and a recall of 97 % (97.8 % in 2015 and 96.9 % in 2016). When the information was found in pathology report, text mining was more than 90 % accuracy for major indicators: PSA test, Gleason score, and incidence date). For both PSA and tumor side, information was not detected in the majority of cases.&quot; Machine learning was able to identify new cases of prostate cancer, and text mining was able to prefill the data about incident cases. Machine-learning-based automation of the registration process could reduce delays in data production and allow investigators to devote more time to complex tasks and analysis.","Fabacher, Godet, Klein, Velten, Jegu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104139","20201023","Cancer registry; Machine learning; Prostate adenocarcinoma; Adenocarcinoma; Algorithms; Data Mining; France; Humans; Incidence; International Classification of Diseases; Machine Learning; Male; Prostatic Neoplasms; Registries","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16899,""

"A meta-analysis and systematic review of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients undergoing vascular surgery procedures","Perioperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) is generally considered preventable. Whereas the non-vascular surgery literature is rich in providing data about the impact of VTE prophylaxis on VTE outcomes, vascular surgery data are relatively sparse on this topic. This study sought to evaluate the evidence for VTE prophylaxis specifically for the population of vascular surgery patients. A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Embase databases in December 2018. Included were studies reporting primary and secondary outcomes for common vascular surgery procedures (open aortic operation, endovascular aneurysm repair [EVAR], peripheral artery bypass, amputation, venous reflux operation). A meta-analysis was performed comparing the patients who did not receive VTE prophylaxis and had VTE complications with patients who developed VTE despite receiving prophylaxis. From 3757 uniquely identified articles, 42 publications met the criteria for inclusion in this review (1 for the category of all vascular operations, 5 for open aortic reconstructions, 2 for EVAR, 1 for open aortic surgery or EVAR, 3 for abdominal or bypass surgery, 2 for peripheral bypass surgery, 2 for amputations, 1 for vascular trauma, and 25 for surgical treatment of superficial venous disease). Five studies met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The results demonstrated slightly lower relative risk for development of VTE among patients receiving VTE prophylaxis (relative risk, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-1.87). After open aortic reconstruction, the risk of VTE is 13% to 18% and is not reduced by VTE prophylaxis. For EVAR patients, the risk of VTE without prophylaxis is 6%. For patients undergoing peripheral bypass surgery and not receiving therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation, the risk of VTE isÃ‚Â &lt;2%. For patients undergoing amputations, VTE prophylaxis reduces the risk of VTE. For patients undergoing surgical treatment of superficial venous disease, there is an abundance of literature exploring the utility of VTE prophylaxis, but the evidence is conflicting; some studies demonstrated a benefit, whereas others showed no reduction of VTE with prophylaxis. Overall, there is a paucity of literature that addresses the effectiveness of VTE prophylaxis specifically in the population of vascular surgery patients. Our meta-analysis of the literature does not demonstrate a statistically significant benefit of VTE prophylaxis among the vascular surgery patients evaluated; however, it does suggest a low incidence of VTE among patients who receive VTE prophylaxis. Clinicians should identify the patients at high risk for development of postoperative VTE as the risk-benefit ratio may favor VTE prophylaxis in a selected group of patients. Clinicians should use their judgment and established VTE risk prediction models to assess VTE risk for patients. Vascular surgeons should consider reporting VTE incidence as a secondary outcome in publications.","Toth, Flohr, Schubart, Knehans, Castello, Aziz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvsv.2020.03.017","20200818","Deep venous thrombosis (DVT); Meta-analysis; Prophylaxis; Vascular surgery; Venous thromboembolism (VTE)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16901,""
"Differentiating Grade in Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Using Texture Analysis of MRI","The objective of this study is to investigate the use of texture analysis (TA) of magnetic resonance image (MRI) enhanced scan and machine learning methods for distinguishing different grades in breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Preoperative prediction of the grade of IDC can provide reference for different clinical treatments, so it has important practice values in clinic. Firstly, a breast cancer segmentation model based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and <i>K</i>-means algorithm is proposed. Secondly, TA was performed and the Gabor wavelet analysis is used to extract the texture feature of an MRI tumor. Then, according to the distance relationship between the features, key features are sorted and feature subsets are selected. Finally, the feature subset is classified by using a support vector machine and adjusted parameters to achieve the best classification effect. By selecting key features for classification prediction, the classification accuracy of the classification model can reach 81.33%. 3-, 4-, and 5-fold cross-validation of the prediction accuracy of the support vector machine model is 77.79%~81.94%. The pathological grading of IDC can be predicted and evaluated by texture analysis and feature extraction of breast tumors. This method can provide much valuable information for doctors' clinical diagnosis. With further development, the model demonstrates high potential for practical clinical use.","Yuan, Liu, Huang, Hu","https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/6913418","20200427","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16902,""
"Clinician-recalled quoted speech in electronic health records and risk of suicide attempt: a case-crossover study","Clinician narrative style in electronic health records (EHR) has rarely been investigated. Clinicians sometimes record brief quotations from patients, possibly more frequently when higher risk is perceived. We investigated whether the frequency of quoted phrases in an EHR was higher in time periods closer to a suicide attempt. A case-crossover study was conducted in a large mental health records database. A natural language processing tool was developed using regular expression matching to identify text occurring within quotation marks in the EHR. Electronic records from a large mental healthcare provider serving a geographic catchment of 1.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°million residents in South London were linked with hospitalisation data. 1503 individuals were identified as having a hospitalised suicide attempt from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2017 with at least one document in both the case period (1-30 days prior to admission) and the control period (61-90 days prior to admission). The number of quoted phrases in the control as compared with the case period. Both attended (OR 1.05, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.02 to 1.08) and non-attended (OR 1.15, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.04 to 1.26) clinical appointments were independently higher in the case compared with control period, while there was no difference in mental healthcare hospitalisation (OR 0.99, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.98 to 1.01). In addition, there was no difference in the levels of quoted text between the comparison time periods (OR 1.09, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.91 to 1.30). This study successfully developed an algorithm to identify quoted speech in text fields from routine mental healthcare records. Contrary to the hypothesis, no association between this exposure and proximity to a suicide attempt was found; however, further evaluation is warranted on the way in which clinician-perceived risk might be feasibly characterised from clinical text.","Jayasinghe, Bittar, Dutta, Stewart","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036186","20200803","health informatics; psychiatry; suicide &amp; self-harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16903,""

"A Review on the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Spinal Diseases","Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used in a wide variety of real-world applications and it emerges as a promising field across various branches of medicine. This review aims to identify the role of ANNs in spinal diseases. Literature were searched from electronic databases of Scopus and Medline from 1993 to 2020 with English publications reported on the application of ANNs in spinal diseases. The search strategy was set as the combinations of the following keywords: &quot;artificial neural networks,&quot; &quot;spine,&quot; &quot;back pain,&quot; &quot;prognosis,&quot; &quot;grading,&quot; &quot;classification,&quot; &quot;prediction,&quot; &quot;segmentation,&quot; &quot;biomechanics,&quot; &quot;deep learning,&quot; and &quot;imaging.&quot; The main findings of the included studies were summarized, with an emphasis on the recent advances in spinal diseases and its application in the diagnostic and prognostic procedures. According to the search strategy, a set of 3,653 articles were retrieved from Medline and Scopus databases. After careful evaluation of the abstracts, the full texts of 89 eligible papers were further examined, of which 79 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria of this review. Our review indicates several applications of ANNs in the management of spinal diseases including (1) diagnosis and assessment of spinal disease progression in the patients with low back pain, perioperative complications, and readmission rate following spine surgery; (2) enhancement of the clinically relevant information extracted from radiographic images to predict Pfirrmann grades, Modic changes, and spinal stenosis grades on magnetic resonance images automatically; (3) prediction of outcomes in lumbar spinal stenosis, lumbar disc herniation and patient-reported outcomes in lumbar fusion surgery, and preoperative planning and intraoperative assistance; and (4) its application in the biomechanical assessment of spinal diseases. The evidence suggests that ANNs can be successfully used for optimizing the diagnosis, prognosis and outcome prediction in spinal diseases. Therefore, incorporation of ANNs into spine clinical practice may improve clinical decision making.","Azimi, Yazdanian, Benzel, Aghaei, Azhari, Sadeghi, Montazeri","https://doi.org/10.31616/asj.2020.0147","20200928","Artificial neural networks; Review; Spine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16905,""
"Combination Strategies for Immune-Checkpoint Blockade and Response Prediction by Artificial Intelligence","The therapeutic concept of unleashing a pre-existing immune response against the tumor by the application of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has resulted in long-term survival in advanced cancer patient subgroups. However, the majority of patients do not benefit from single-agent ICI and therefore new combination strategies are eagerly necessitated. In addition to conventional chemotherapy, kinase inhibitors as well as tumor-specific vaccinations are extensively investigated in combination with ICI to augment therapy responses. An unprecedented clinical outcome with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-)T cell therapy has led to the approval for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia whereas response rates in solid tumors are unsatisfactory. Immune-checkpoints negatively impact CAR-T cell therapy in hematologic and solid malignancies and as a consequence provide a therapeutic target to overcome resistance. Established biomarkers such as programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) help to select patients who will benefit most from ICI, however, biomarker negativity does not exclude responses. Investigating alterations in the antigen presenting pathway as well as radiomics have the potential to determine tumor immunogenicity and response to ICI. Within this review we summarize the literature about specific combination partners for ICI and the applicability of artificial intelligence to predict ICI therapy responses.","Huemer, Leisch, Geisberger, Melchardt, Rinnerthaler, Zaborsky, Greil","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21082856","20200523","CAR-T cell; HLA; PD-1; PD-L1; T cell exhaustion; kinase inhibitor; radiomics; resistance mechanism; tumor neoantigen; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16906,""
"BioConceptVec: Creating and evaluating literature-based biomedical concept embeddings on a large scale","A massive number of biological entities, such as genes and mutations, are mentioned in the biomedical literature. The capturing of the semantic relatedness of biological entities is vital to many biological applications, such as protein-protein interaction prediction and literature-based discovery. Concept embeddings-which involve the learning of vector representations of concepts using machine learning models-have been employed to capture the semantics of concepts. To develop concept embeddings, named-entity recognition (NER) tools are first used to identify and normalize concepts from the literature, and then different machine learning models are used to train the embeddings. Despite multiple attempts, existing biomedical concept embeddings generally suffer from suboptimal NER tools, small-scale evaluation, and limited availability. In response, we employed high-performance machine learning-based NER tools for concept recognition and trained our concept embeddings, BioConceptVec, via four different machine learning models on ~30 million PubMed abstracts. BioConceptVec covers over 400,000 biomedical concepts mentioned in the literature and is of the largest among the publicly available biomedical concept embeddings to date. To evaluate the validity and utility of BioConceptVec, we respectively performed two intrinsic evaluations (identifying related concepts based on drug-gene and gene-gene interactions) and two extrinsic evaluations (protein-protein interaction prediction and drug-drug interaction extraction), collectively using over 25 million instances from nine independent datasets (17 million instances from six intrinsic evaluation tasks and 8 million instances from three extrinsic evaluation tasks), which is, by far, the most comprehensive to our best knowledge. The intrinsic evaluation results demonstrate that BioConceptVec consistently has, by a large margin, better performance than existing concept embeddings in identifying similar and related concepts. More importantly, the extrinsic evaluation results demonstrate that using BioConceptVec with advanced deep learning models can significantly improve performance in downstream bioinformatics studies and biomedical text-mining applications. Our BioConceptVec embeddings and benchmarking datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/BioConceptVec.","Chen, Lee, Yan, Kim, Wei, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007617","20200720","Algorithms; Computational Biology; Data Mining; Databases, Protein; Deep Learning; Drug Interactions; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Protein Interaction Mapping; PubMed; Publications; Semantics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16907,""
"Artificial Intelligence in radiotherapy: state of the art and future directions","Recent advances in computing capability allowed the development of sophisticated predictive models to assess complex relationships within observational data, described as Artificial Intelligence. Medicine is one of the several fields of application and Radiation oncology could benefit from these approaches, particularly in patients' medical records, imaging, baseline pathology, planning or instrumental data. Artificial Intelligence systems could simplify many steps of the complex workflow of radiotherapy such as segmentation, planning or delivery. However, Artificial Intelligence could be considered as a &quot;black box&quot; in which human operator may only understand input and output predictions and its application to the clinical practice remains a challenge. The low transparency of the overall system is questionable from manifold points of view (ethical included). Given the complexity of this issue, we collected the basic definitions to help the clinician to understand current literature, and overviewed experiences regarding implementation of AI within radiotherapy clinical workflow, aiming to describe this field from the clinician perspective.","Francolini, Desideri, Stocchi, Salvestrini, Ciccone, Garlatti, Loi, Livi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12032-020-01374-w","20200529","Artificial Intelligence; Autocontouring; Deep neural networks; Machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16908,""
"Brain Morphometry Estimation: From Hours to Seconds Using Deep Learning","<b>Motivation:</b> Brain morphometry from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising neuroimaging biomarker for the non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. Current tools for brain morphometry often come with a high computational burden, making them hard to use in clinical routine, where time is often an issue. We propose a deep learning-based approach to predict the volumes of anatomically delineated subcortical regions of interest (ROI), and mean thicknesses and curvatures of cortical parcellations directly from T1-weighted MRI. Advantages are the timely availability of results while maintaining a clinically relevant accuracy. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> An anonymized dataset of 574 subjects (443 healthy controls and 131 patients with epilepsy) was used for the supervised training of a convolutional neural network (CNN). A <i>silver-standard</i> ground truth was generated with FreeSurfer 6.0. <b>Results:</b> The CNN predicts a total of 165 morphometric measures directly from raw MR images. Analysis of the results using intraclass correlation coefficients showed, in general, good correlation with FreeSurfer generated ground truth data, with some of the regions nearly reaching human inter-rater performance (ICC &gt; 0.75). Cortical thicknesses predicted by the CNN showed cross-sectional annual age-related gray matter atrophy rates both globally (thickness change of -0.004 mm/year) and regionally in agreement with the literature. A statistical test to dichotomize patients with epilepsy from healthy controls revealed similar effect sizes for structures affecting all subtypes as reported in a large-scale epilepsy study. <b>Conclusions:</b> We demonstrate the general feasibility of using deep learning to estimate human brain morphometry directly from T1-weighted MRI within seconds. A comparison of the results to other publications shows accuracies of comparable magnitudes for the subcortical volumes and cortical thicknesses.","Rebsamen, Suter, Wiest, Reyes, Rummel","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00244","20200928","MRI; cortical thickness; deep learning; epilepsy; human brain morphometry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16909,""
"Definition and diagnosis of constitutional thinness: a systematic review","The existing literature about the definition and diagnostic criteria of constitutional thinness (CT) appears equivocal. The present work systematically reviewed the criteria used in the diagnosis of adult individuals with CT (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019138236). Five electronic bibliographic databases were searched between December 2018 and November 2019: MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL (Cochrane Library), Google Scholar and Clinical Trials. Search terms were combined with Medical Subject Headings terms. The search strategy included any clinical trials that enrolled adults with CT. Studies were systematically excluded if the state of thinness was not due to a well-identified constitutional origin. From the 689 references after duplicate removal, 199 studies were excluded based on title and 164 based on abstract. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 291 other studies were removed. Finally, thirty-five studies remained at the end of the process. The analysis of these studies showed high heterogeneity in the diagnostic criteria of CT. A real need emerged to adopt a common terminology and to systematically exclude potential non-constitutional origins of thinness such as eating disorders, associated pathology or over-exercising, with validated tools. Weight history, physiological menses and weight gain resistance are also important criteria to consider. The present systematic review revealed that our medical and scientific approaches of CT need to be harmonised in terms of terminology and diagnostic criteria. Although further studies are needed, we finally proposed recommendations and a decision tree to help in the recognition and diagnosis of CT.","Bailly, Germain, Galusca, Courteix, Thivel, Verney","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114520001440","20201020","Constitutional leanness; Constitutional thinness; Diagnosis; Underweight; Weight gain resistance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16910,""
"A Hybrid Reporting Platform for Extended RadLex Coding Combining Structured Reporting Templates and Natural Language Processing","Structured reporting is a favorable and sustainable form of reporting in radiology. Among its advantages are better presentation, clearer nomenclature, and higher quality. By using MRRT-compliant templates, the content of the categorized items (e.g., select fields) can be automatically stored in a database, which allows further research and quality analytics based on established ontologies like RadLexÃ‚Â® linked to the items. Additionally, it is relevant to provide free-text input for descriptions of findings and impressions in complex imaging studies or for the information included with the clinical referral. So far, however, this unstructured content cannot be categorized. We developed a solution to analyze and code these free-text parts of the templates in our MRRT-compliant reporting platform, using natural language processing (NLP) with RadLexÃ‚Â® terms in addition to the already categorized items. The established hybrid reporting concept is working successfully. The NLP tool provides RadLexÃ‚Â® codes with modifiers (affirmed, speculated, negated). Radiologists can confirm or reject codes provided by NLP before finalizing the structured report. Furthermore, users can suggest RadLexÃ‚Â® codes from free text that is not correctly coded with NLP or can suggest to change the modifier. Analyzing free-text fields took 1.23Ã‚Â s on average. Hybrid reporting enables coding of free-text information in our MRRT-compliant templates and thus increases the amount of categorized data that can be stored in the database. This enhances the possibilities for further analyses, such as correlating clinical information with radiological findings or storing high-quality structured information for machine-learning approaches.","Jungmann, Arnhold, KÃƒÂ¤mpgen, Jorg, DÃƒÂ¼ber, Mildenberger, Kloeckner","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10278-020-00342-0","20201016","Database; Medical informatics; Natural language processing; RadLex; Structured reporting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16911,""
"Promises of artificial intelligence in neuroradiology: a systematic technographic review","To conduct a systematic review of the possibilities of artificial intelligence (AI) in neuroradiology by performing an objective, systematic assessment of available applications. To analyse the potential impacts of AI applications on the work of neuroradiologists. We identified AI applications offered on the market during the period 2017-2019. We systematically collected and structured information in a relational database and coded for the characteristics of the applications, their functionalities for the radiology workflow and their potential impacts in terms of 'supporting', 'extending' and 'replacing' radiology tasks. We identified 37 AI applications in the domain of neuroradiology from 27 vendors, together offering 111 functionalities. The majority of functionalities 'support' radiologists, especially for the detection and interpretation of image findings. The second-largest group of functionalities 'extends' the possibilities of radiologists by providing quantitative information about pathological findings. A small but noticeable portion of functionalities seek to 'replace' certain radiology tasks. Artificial intelligence in neuroradiology is not only in the stage of development and testing but also available for clinical practice. The majority of functionalities support radiologists or extend their tasks. None of the applications can replace the entire radiology profession, but a few applications can do so for a limited set of tasks.

"Different fundus imaging modalities and technical factors in AI screening for diabetic retinopathy: a review","Effective screening is a desirable method for the early detection and successful treatment for diabetic retinopathy, and fundus photography is currently the dominant medium for retinal imaging due to its convenience and accessibility. Manual screening using fundus photographs has however involved considerable costs for patients, clinicians and national health systems, which has limited its application particularly in less-developed countries. The advent of artificial intelligence, and in particular deep learning techniques, has however raised the possibility of widespread automated screening. In this review, we first briefly survey major published advances in retinal analysis using artificial intelligence. We take care to separately describe standard multiple-field fundus photography, and the newer modalities of ultra-wide field photography and smartphone-based photography. Finally, we consider several machine learning concepts that have been particularly relevant to the domain and illustrate their usage with extant works. In the ophthalmology field, it was demonstrated that deep learning tools for diabetic retinopathy show clinically acceptable diagnostic performance when using colour retinal fundus images. Artificial intelligence models are among the most promising solutions to tackle the burden of diabetic retinopathy management in a comprehensive manner. However, future research is crucial to assess the potential clinical deployment, evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different DL systems in clinical practice and improve clinical acceptance.","Lim, Bellemo, Xie, Lee, Yip, Ting","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40662-020-00182-7","20200928","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Diabetic retinopathy; Fundus photographs; Retinal imaging modalities; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16914,""
"Translating research findings into clinical practice: a systematic and critical review of neuroimaging-based clinical tools for brain disorders","A pivotal aim of psychiatric and neurological research is to promote the translation of the findings into clinical practice to improve diagnostic and prognostic assessment of individual patients. Structural neuroimaging holds much promise, with neuroanatomical measures accounting for up to 40% of the variance in clinical outcome. Building on these findings, a number of imaging-based clinical tools have been developed to make diagnostic and prognostic inferences about individual patients from their structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans. This systematic review describes and compares the technical characteristics of the available tools, with the aim to assess their translational potential into real-world clinical settings. The results reveal that a total of eight tools. All of these were specifically developed for neurological disorders, and as such are not suitable for application to psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, most of the tools were trained and validated in a single dataset, which can result in poor generalizability, or using a small number of individuals, which can cause overoptimistic results. In addition, all of the tools rely on two strategies to detect brain abnormalities in single individuals, one based on univariate comparison, and the other based on multivariate machine-learning algorithms. We discuss current barriers to the adoption of these tools in clinical practice and propose a checklist of pivotal characteristics that should be included in an &quot;ideal&quot; neuroimaging-based clinical tool for brain disorders.","Scarpazza, Ha, Baecker, Garcia-Dias, Pinaya, Vieira, Mechelli","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-0798-6","20200901","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16915,""
"Magnetic resonance imaging features of tumor and lymph node to predict clinical outcome in node-positive cervical cancer: a retrospective analysis","Current chemoradiation regimens for locally advanced cervical cancer are fairly uniform despite a profound diversity of treatment response and recurrence patterns. The wide range of treatment responses and prognoses to standardized concurrent chemoradiation highlights the need for a reliable tool to predict treatment outcomes. We investigated pretreatment magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features of primary tumor and involved lymph node for predicting clinical outcome in cervical cancer patients. We included 93 node-positive cervical cancer patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy at our institution between 2006 and 2017. The median follow-up period was 38Ã¢â‚¬â€°months (range, 5-128). Primary tumor and involved lymph node were manually segmented on axial gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images as well as T2-weighted images and saved as 3-dimensional regions of interest (ROI). After the segmentation, imaging features related to histogram, shape, and texture were extracted from each ROI. Using these features, random survival forest (RSF) models were built to predict local control (LC), regional control (RC), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) in the training dataset (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°62). The generated models were then tested in the validation dataset (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°31). For predicting LC, models generated from primary tumor imaging features showed better predictive performance (C-index, 0.72) than those from lymph node features (C-index, 0.62). In contrast, models from lymph nodes showed superior performance for predicting RC, DMFS, and OS compared to models of the primary tumor. According to the 3-year time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis of LC, RC, DMFS, and OS prediction, the respective area under the curve values for the predicted risk of the models generated from the training dataset were 0.634, 0.796, 0.733, and 0.749 in the validation dataset. Our results suggest that tumor and lymph node imaging features may play complementary roles for predicting clinical outcomes in node-positive cervical cancer.","Park, Hahm, Bae, Chong, Jeong, Na, Jeong, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13014-020-01502-w","20200425","Cervical cancer; Chemoradiotherapy; Lymph node; Predictive modeling; Radiomics; Texture analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16916,""
"Towards Interpretable Skin Lesion Classification with Deep Learning Models","Skin disease is a prevalent condition all over the world. Computer vision-based technology for automatic skin lesion classification holds great promise as an effective screening tool for early diagnosis. In this paper, we propose an accurate and interpretable deep learning pipeline to achieve such a goal. Comparing with existing research, we would like to highlight the following aspects of our model. 1) Rather than a single model, our approach ensembles a set of deep learning architectures to achieve better classification accuracy; 2) Generative adversarial network (GAN) is involved in the model training to promote data scale and diversity; 3) Local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) strategy is applied to extract evidence from the skin images to support the classification results. Our experimental results on real-world skin image corpus demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. The explainability of our model further enhances its applicability in real clinical practice.","Xiang, Wang","https://www.google.com/search?q=Towards+Interpretable+Skin+Lesion+Classification+with+Deep+Learning+Models.","20200917","Deep Learning; Humans; Keratosis; Models, Biological; Neural Networks, Computer; Nevus; Skin Diseases; Skin Neoplasms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16917,""
"Relation Extraction from Clinical Narratives Using Pre-trained Language Models","Natural language processing (NLP) is useful for extracting information from clinical narratives, and both traditional machine learning methods and more-recent deep learning methods have been successful in various clinical NLP tasks. These methods often depend on traditional word embeddings that are outputs of language models (LMs). Recently, methods that are directly based on pre-trained language models themselves, followed by fine-tuning on the LMs (e.g. the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)), have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks. Despite their success in the open domain and biomedical literature, these pre-trained LMs have not yet been applied to the clinical relation extraction (RE) task. In this study, we developed two different implementations of the BERT model for clinical RE tasks. Our results show that our tuned LMs outperformed previous state-of-the-art RE systems in two shared tasks, which demonstrates the potential of LM-based methods on the RE task.","Wei, Ji, Si, Du, Wang, Tiryaki, Wu, Tao, Roberts, Xu","https://www.google.com/search?q=Relation+Extraction+from+Clinical+Narratives+Using+Pre-trained+Language+Models.","20200917","Datasets as Topic; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Machine Learning; Narration; Natural Language Processing; Semantics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16918,""
"Learning Inter-Sentence, Disorder-Centric, Biomedical Relationships from Medical Literature","Relationships between disorders and their associated tests, treatments and symptoms underpin essential information needs of clinicians and can support biomedical knowledge bases, information retrieval and ultimately clinical decision support. These relationships exist in the biomedical literature, however they are not directly available and have to be extracted from the text. Existing, automated biomedical relationship extraction methods tend to be narrow in scope, e.g., protein-protein interactions, and pertain to intra-sentence relationships. The proposed approach targets intra and inter-sentence, disorder-centric relationship extraction. It employs an LSTM deep learning model that utilises a novel, sequential feature set, including medical concept embeddings. The LSTM model outperforms rule based and co-occurrence models by at least +78% in F1 score, suggesting that inter-sentence relationships are an important subset of all disorder-centric relations and that our approach shows promise for inter-sentence relationship extraction in this and possibly other domains.","van der Vegt, Zuccon, Koopman","https://www.google.com/search?q=Learning+Inter-Sentence,+Disorder-Centric,+Biomedical+Relationships+from+Medical+Literature.","20200917","Deep Learning; Disease; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Natural Language Processing; Publications; Vocabulary, Controlled","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16919,""
"Using FHIR to Construct a Corpus of Clinical Questions Annotated with Logical Forms and Answers","This paper describes a novel technique for annotating logical forms and answers for clinical questions by utilizing Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Such annotations are widely used in building the semantic parsing models (which aim at understanding the precise meaning of natural language questions by converting them to machine-understandable logical forms). These systems focus on reducing the time it takes for a user to get to information present in electronic health records (EHRs). Directly annotating questions with logical forms is a challenging task and involves a time-consuming step of concept normalization annotation. We aim to automate this step using the normalized codes present in a FHIR resource. Using the proposed approach, two annotators curated an annotated dataset of 1000 questions in less than 1 week. To assess the quality of these annotations, we trained a semantic parsing model which achieved an accuracy of 94.2% on this corpus.","Soni, Gudala, Wang, Roberts","https://www.google.com/search?q=Using+FHIR+to+Construct+a+Corpus+of+Clinical+Questions+Annotated+with+Logical+Forms+and+Answers.","20200917","Data Curation; Datasets as Topic; Electronic Health Records; Health Information Interoperability; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Semantics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16920,""
"Leveraging Contextual Information in Extracting Long Distance Relations from Clinical Notes","Relation extraction from biomedical text is important for clinical decision support applications. In post-marketing pharmacovigilance, for example, Adverse Drug Events (ADE) relate medical problems to the drugs that caused them and were the focus of two recent shared challenges. While good results were reported, there was a room for improvement. Here, we studied two new improved methods for relation extraction: (1) State-of-the-art deep learning contextual representation model called BERT, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers; (2) Selection of negative training samples based on the &quot;near-miss&quot; hypothesis (the Edge sampling). We used the datasets from MADE and N2C2 Task-2 for performance evaluation. BERT and Edge together improved performance of ADE and Reason (indication) relations extraction by 6.4-6.7 absolute percentage (and error rate reduction of 24%-28%). ADE and Reason relations contained longer text between the entities, which BERT and Edge were able to leverage to achieve the performance improvement.

"De-identification of Clinical Text via Bi-LSTM-CRF with Neural Language Models","De-identification of clinical text, the prerequisite of electronic clinical data reuse, is a typical named entity recogni tion (NER) problem. A number of state-of-the-art deep learning methods for NER, such as Bi-LSTM-CRF (bidirec tional long-short-term-memory conditional random fields), have been applied for de-identification. Neural language models used for language representation bring great improvement in lots of NLP tasks when they are integrated with other deep learning methods.

"Efficient identification of patients eligible for clinical studies using case-based reasoning on Scottish Health Research register (SHARE)","Trials often struggle to achieve their target sample size with only half doing so. Some researchers have turned to Electronic Health Records (EHRs), seeking a more efficient way of recruitment. The Scottish Health Research Register (SHARE) obtained patients' consent for their EHRs to be used as a searching base from which researchers can find potential participants. However, due to the fact that EHR data is not complete, sufficient or accurate, a database search strategy may not generate the best case-finding result. The current study aims to evaluate the performance of a case-based reasoning method in identifying participants for population-based clinical studies recruiting through SHARE, and assess the difference between its resultant cohort and the original one deriving from searching EHRs. A case-based reasoning framework was applied to 119 participants in nine projects using two-fold cross-validation, with records from a further 86,292 individuals used for testing. A prediction score for study participation was derived from the diagnosis, procedure, pharmaceutical prescription, and laboratory test results attributes of each participant. Evaluation was conducted by calculating Area Under the ROC Curve and information retrieval metrics for the ranking list of the test set by prediction score. We compared the most likely participants as identified by searching a database to those ranked highest by our model. The average ROCAUC for nine projects was 81% indicating strong predictive ability for these data. However, the derived ranking lists showed lower predictive performance, with only 21% of the persons ranked within top 50 positions being the same as identified by searching databases. Case-based reasoning is may be more effective than a database search strategy for participant identification for clinical studies using population EHRs. The lower performance of ranking lists derived from case-based reasoning means that patients identified as highly suitable for study participation may still not be recruited. This suggests that further study is needed into improvements in the collection and curation of population EHRs, such as use of free text data to aid reliable identification of people more likely to be recruited to clinical trials.","Shi, Kelsey, Sullivan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-1091-6","20200424","Artificial intelligence; Clinical studies; Electronic health record; Machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16926,""
"Global updates in the treatment of gastric cancer: a systematic review Part 2: perioperative management, multimodal therapies, new technologies, standardization of the surgical treatment and educational aspects","Gastric cancer is the fifth malignancy and the third cause of cancer death worldwide, according to the global cancer statistics presented in 2018. Its definition and staging have been revised in the eight edition of the AJCC/TNM classification, which took effect in 2018. Novel molecular classifications for GC have been recently established and the process of translating these classifications into clinical practice is ongoing. The cornerstone of GC treatment is surgical, in a context of multimodal therapy. Surgical treatment is being standardized, and is evolving according to new anatomical concepts and to the recent technological developments. This is leading to a massive improvement in the use of mini-invasive techniques. Mini-invasive techniques aim to be equivalent to open surgery from an oncologic point of view, with better short-term outcomes. The persecution of better short-term outcomes also includes the optimization of the perioperative management, which is being implemented on large scale according to the enhanced recovery after surgery principles. In the era of precision medicine, multimodal treatment is also evolving. The long-time-awaited results of many trials investigating the role for preoperative and postoperative management have been published, changing the clinical practice. Novel investigations focused both on traditional chemotherapeutic regimens and targeted therapies are currently ongoing. Modern platforms increase the possibility for further standardization of the different treatments, promote the use of big data and open new possibilities for surgical learning.

"Prognostic models for prolonged disorders of consciousness: an integrative review","Disorders of consciousness (DoC) are acquired conditions of severe altered consciousness. During the past decades, some prognostic models for DoC have been explored on the basis of a variety of predictors, including demographics, neurological examinations, clinical diagnosis, neurophysiology and brain images. In this article, a systematic review of pertinent literature was conducted. We identified and evaluated 21 prognostic models involving a total of 1201 DoC patients. In terms of the reported accuracies of predicting the prognosis of DoC, these 21 models vary widely, ranging from 60 to 90%. Using improvement of consciousness level as favorable outcome criteria, we performed a quantitative meta-analysis, and found that the pooled sensitivity and specificity of the hybrid model that combined more than one technique were both superior to those of any single technique, including EEG and fMRI at the tasks and resting state. These results support the view that any single technique has its own advantages and limitations; and the integrations of multiple techniques, including diverse brain images and different paradigms, have the potential to improve predictive accuracy for DoC. Then, we provide methodological points of view and some prospects about future research.

"Individualized Diagnostic and Prognostic Models for Patients With Psychosis Risk Syndromes: A Meta-analytic View on the State of the Art","The clinical high risk (CHR) paradigm has facilitated research into the underpinnings of help-seeking individuals at risk for developing psychosis, aiming at predicting and possibly preventing transition to the overt disorder. Statistical methods such as machine learning and Cox regression have provided the methodological basis for this research by enabling the construction of diagnostic models (i.e., distinguishing CHR individuals from healthy individuals) and prognostic models (i.e., predicting a future outcome) based on different data modalities, including clinical, neurocognitive, and neurobiological data. However, their translation to clinical practice is still hindered by the high heterogeneity of both CHR populations and methodologies applied. We systematically reviewed the literature on diagnostic and prognostic models built on Cox regression and machine learning. Furthermore, we conducted a meta-analysis on prediction performances investigating heterogeneity of methodological approaches and data modality. A total of 44 articles were included, covering 3707 individuals for prognostic studies and 1052 individuals for diagnostic studies (572 CHR patients and 480 healthy control subjects). CHR patients could be classified against healthy control subjects with 78% sensitivity and 77% specificity. Across prognostic models, sensitivity reached 67% and specificity reached 78%. Machine learning models outperformed those applying Cox regression by 10% sensitivity. There was a publication bias for prognostic studies yet no other moderator effects. Our results may be driven by substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity currently affecting several aspects of the CHR field and limiting the clinical implementability of the proposed models.

"Smartphone as a monitoring tool for bipolar disorder: a systematic review including data analysis, machine learning algorithms and predictive modelling","Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic illness with a high recurrence rate. Smartphones can be a useful tool for detecting prodromal symptoms of episode recurrence (through real-time monitoring) and providing options for early intervention between outpatient visits. The aim of this systematic review is to overview and discuss the studies on the smartphone-based systems that monitor or detect the phase change in BD. We also discuss the challenges concerning predictive modelling. Published studies were identified through searching the electronic databases. Predictive attributes reflecting illness activity were evaluated including data from patients' self-assessment ratings and objectively measured data collected via smartphone. Articles were reviewed according to PRISMA guidelines. Objective data automatically collected using smartphones (voice data from phone calls and smartphone-usage data reflecting social and physical activities) are valid markers of a mood state.

"Enhancing ICD-Code-Based Case Definition for Heart Failure Using Electronic Medical Record Data","Surveillance and outcome studies for heart failure (HF) require accurate identification of patients with HF. Algorithms based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes to identify HF from administrative data are inadequate owing to their relatively low sensitivity. Detailed clinical information from electronic medical records (EMRs) is potentially useful for improving ICD algorithms. This study aimed to enhance the ICD algorithm for HF definition by incorporating comprehensive information from EMRs. The study included 2106 inpatients in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Medical chart review was used as the reference gold standard for evaluating developed algorithms. The commonly used ICD codes for defining HF were used (namely, the ICD algorithm). The performance of different algorithms using the free text discharge summaries from a population-based EMR were compared with the ICD algorithm. These algorithms included a keyword search algorithm looking for HF-specific terms, a machine learning-based HF concept (HFC) algorithm, an EMR structured data based algorithm, and combined algorithms (the ICD and HFC combined algorithm). Of 2106 patients, 296 (14.1%) were patients with HF as determined by chart review. The ICD algorithm had 92.4% positive predictive value (PPV) but low sensitivity (57.4%). The EMR keyword search algorithm achieved a higher sensitivity (65.5%) than the ICD algorithm, but with a lower PPV (77.6%). The HFC algorithm achieved a better sensitivity (80.0%) and maintained a reasonable PPV (88.9%) compared with the ICD algorithm and the keyword algorithm. An even higher sensitivity (83.3%) was reached by combining the HFC and ICD algorithms, with a lower PPV (83.3%). The structured EMR data algorithm reached a sensitivity of 78% and a PPV of 54.2%. The combined EMR structured data and ICD algorithm had a higher sensitivity (82.4%), but the PPV remained low at 54.8%. All algorithms had a specificity ranging from 87.5% to 99.2%. Applying natural language processing and machine learning on the discharge summaries of inpatient EMR data can improve the capture of cases of HF compared with the widely used ICD algorithm. The utility of the HFC algorithm is straightforward, making it easily applied for HF case identification.","Xu, Lee, Martin, D'souza, Doktorchik, Jiang, Lee, Eastwood, Fine, Hemmelgarn, Todd, Quan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cardfail.2020.04.003","20200720","Electronic medical record; case definition; heart failure; machine learning; natural language processing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16932,""
"Ethical Use of Electronic Health Record Data and Artificial Intelligence: Recommendations of the Primary Care Informatics Working Group of the International Medical Informatics Association","To create practical recommendations for the curation of routinely collected health data and artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care with a focus on ensuring their ethical use. We defined data curation as the process of management of data throughout its lifecycle to ensure it can be used into the future. We used a literature review and Delphi exercises to capture insights from the Primary Care Informatics Working Group (PCIWG) of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). We created six recommendations: (1) Ensure consent and formal process to govern access and sharing throughout the data life cycle; (2) Sustainable data creation/collection requires trust and permission; (3) Pay attention to Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes as they may have unrecognised risks; (4) Integrate data governance and data quality management to support clinical practice in integrated care systems; (5) Recognise the need for new processes to address the ethical issues arising from AI in primary care; (6) Apply an ethical framework mapped to the data life cycle, including an assessment of data quality to achieve effective data curation. The ethical use of data needs to be integrated within the curation process, hence running throughout the data lifecycle. Current information systems may not fully detect the risks associated with ETL and AI; they need careful scrutiny. With distributed integrated care systems where data are often used remote from documentation, harmonised data quality assessment, management, and governance is important. These recommendations should help maintain trust and connectedness in contemporary information systems and planned developments.","Liaw, Liyanage, Kuziemsky, Terry, Schreiber, Jonnagaddala, de Lusignan","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1701980","20200825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16933,""
"Oxycodone versus morphine for cancer pain titration: A systematic review and pharmacoeconomic evaluation","To evaluate the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Controlled-release Tablets (CR oxycodone) and Morphine Sulfate Sustained-release Tablets (SR morphine) for moderate to severe cancer pain titration. Randomized controlled trials meeting the inclusion criteria were searched through Medline, Cochrane Library, Pubmed, EMbase, CNKI,VIP and WanFang database from the data of their establishment to June 2019. The efficacy and safety data were extracted from the included literature. The pain control rate was calculated to eatimate efficacy. Meta-analysis was conducted by Revman5.1.4. A decision tree model was built to simulate cancer pain titration process. The initial dose of CR oxycodone and SR morphine group were 20mg and 30mg respectively. Oral immediate-release morphine was administered to treat break-out pain. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was performed with TreeAge Pro 2019. 19 studies (1680 patients)were included in this study. Meta-analysis showed that the pain control rate of CR oxycodone and SR morphine were 86% and 82.98% respectively. The costs of CR oxycodone and SR morphine were $23.27 and $13.31. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per unit was approximate $329.76. At the willingness-to-pay threshold of $8836, CR oxycodone was cost-effective, while the corresponding probability of being cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay threshold of $300 was 31.6%. One-way sensitivity analysis confirmed robustness of results. CR oxycodone could be a cost-effective option compared with SR morphine for moderate to severe cancer pain titration in China, according to the threshold defined by the WHO.","Zhou, Wang, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231763","20200715","Cancer Pain; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Trees; Delayed-Action Preparations; Economics, Pharmaceutical; Humans; Morphine; Oxycodone; Publication Bias; Risk; Treatment Outcome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16934,""

"Fog computing at industrial level, architecture, latency, energy, and security: A review","The industrial applications in the cloud do not meet the requirements of low latency and reliability since variables must be continuously monitored. For this reason, industrial internet of things (IIoT) is a challenge for the current infrastructure because it generates a large amount of data making cloud computing reach the edge and become fog computing (FC). FC can be considered as a new component of Industry 4.0, which aims to solve the problem of big data, reduce energy consumption in industrial sensor networks, improve the security, processing and storage real-time data. It is a promising growing paradigm that offers new opportunities and challenges, beside the ones inherited from cloud computing, which requires a new heterogeneous architecture to improve the network capacity for delivering edge services, that is, providing computing resources closer to the end user. The purpose of this research is to show a systematic review of the most recent studies about the architecture, security, latency, and energy consumption that FC presents at industrial level and thus provide an overview of the current characteristics and challenges of this new technology.","Caiza, Saeteros, OÃƒÂ±ate, Garcia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03706","20200928","Cloud computing; Computer science; Fog computing; Fog nodes; Industry 4.0; Smart factories","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16936,""
"Diagnosis support systems for rare diseases: a scoping review","Rare diseases affect approximately 350 million people worldwide. Delayed diagnosis is frequent due to lack of knowledge of most clinicians and a small number of expert centers. Consequently, computerized diagnosis support systems have been developed to address these issues, with many relying on rare disease expertise and taking advantage of the increasing volume of generated and accessible health-related data. Our objective is to perform a review of all initiatives aiming to support the diagnosis of rare diseases. A scoping review was conducted based on methods proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. A charting form for relevant study analysis was developed and used to categorize data. Sixty-eight studies were retained at the end of the charting process. Diagnosis targets varied from 1 rare disease to all rare diseases. Material used for diagnosis support consisted mostly of phenotype concepts, images or fluids. Fifty-seven percent of the studies used expert knowledge. Two-thirds of the studies relied on machine learning algorithms, and one-third used simple similarities. Manual algorithms were encountered as well. Most of the studies presented satisfying performance of evaluation by comparison with references or with external validation. Fourteen studies provided online tools, most of which aimed to support the diagnosis of all rare diseases by considering queries based on phenotype concepts. Numerous solutions relying on different materials and use of various methodologies are emerging with satisfying preliminary results. However, the variability of approaches and evaluation processes complicates the comparison of results. Efforts should be made to adequately validate these tools and guarantee reproducibility and explicability.","Faviez, Chen, Garcelon, Neuraz, Knebelmann, Salomon, Lyonnet, Saunier, Burgun","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-020-01374-z","20200831","Artificial intelligence; Clinical decision support; Diagnosis; Genetic diseases; Machine learning; Patient similarity; Phenotype; Rare disease; Scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16937,""
"Automated classification of five seizure onset patterns from intracranial electroencephalogram signals","The electroencephalographic (EEG) signals contain information about seizures and their onset location. There are several seizure onset patterns reported in the literature, and these patterns have clinical significance. In this work, we propose a system to automatically classify five seizure onset patterns from intracerebral EEG signals. The EEG was segmented by clinicians indicating the start and end time of each seizure onset pattern, the channels involved at onset and the seizure onset pattern. Twelve features that represent the time domain characteristics and signal complexity were extracted from 663 seizures channels of 24 patients. The features were used for classification of the patterns with support vector machine - Error-Correcting Output Codes (SVM-ECOC). Three patient groups with a similar number of seizure segments were created, and one group was used for testing and the rest for training. This test was repeated by rotating the testing and training data. The feature space formed by both time domain and multiscale sample entropy features perform well in classification of the data. An overall accuracy of 80.7% was obtained with these features and a linear kernel of SVM-ECOC. The seizure onset patterns consist of varied time and complexity characteristics. It is possible to automatically classify various seizure onset patterns very similarly to visual classification. The proposed system could aid the medical team in assessing intracerebral EEG by providing an objective classification of seizure onset patterns.","Makaram, von Ellenrieder, Tanaka, Gotman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2020.02.011","20200504","Ictal onset; Ictal spread; Intracranial EEG; Machine learning; Multiscale entropy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16938,""
"Clinical decision support system to predict chronic kidney disease: A fuzzy expert system approach","Diagnosis and early intervention of chronic kidney disease are essential to prevent loss of kidney function and a large amount of financial resources. To this end, we developed a fuzzy logic-based expert system for diagnosis and prediction of chronic kidney disease and evaluate its robustness against noisy data. At first, we identified the diagnostic parameters and risk factors through a literature review and a survey of 18 nephrologists. Depending on the features selected, a set of fuzzy rules for the prediction of chronic kidney disease was determined by reviewing the literature, guidelines and consulting with nephrologists. Fuzzy expert system was developed using MATLAB software and Mamdani Inference System. Finally, the fuzzy expert system was evaluated using data extracted from 216 randomly selected medical records of patients with and without chronic kidney disease. We added noisy data to our dataset and compare the performance of the system on original and noisy datasets. We selected 16 parameters for the prediction of chronic kidney disease. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the final system were 92.13 %, 95.37 %, and 88.88 %, respectively. The area under the curve was 0.92 and the Kappa coefficient was 0.84, indicating a very high correlation between the system diagnosis and the final diagnosis recorded in the medical records. The performance of the system on noisy input variables indicated that in the worse scenario, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the system decreased only by 4.43 %, 7.48 %, and 5.41 %, respectively. Considering the desirable performance of the proposed expert system, the system can be useful in the prediction of chronic kidney disease.","Hamedan, Orooji, Sanadgol, Sheikhtaheri","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104134","20201020","Chronic kidney disease; Clinical decision support system; Expert system; Fuzzy logic; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Expert Systems; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16939,""
"Neural negated entity recognition in Spanish electronic health records","This work deals with negation detection in the context of clinical texts. Negation detection is a key for decision support systems since negated events (detection of absence of some events) help ascertain current medical conditions. For artificial intelligence, negation detection is a valuable point as it can revert the meaning of a part of a text and, accordingly, influence other tasks such as medical dosage adjustment, the detection of adverse drug reactions or hospital acquired diseases. We focus on negated medical events such as disorders, findings and allergies. From Natural Language Processing (NLP) background, we refer to them as negated medical entities. A novelty of this work is that we approached this task as Named Entity Recognition (NER) with the restriction that just negated medical entities must be recognized (in an attempt to help distinguish them from non-negated ones). Our study is driven with Electronic Health Records (EHRs) written in Spanish. A challenge to cope with is the lexical variability (alternative medical forms, abbreviations, etc.). To this end, we employed an approach based on deep learning. Specifically, the system combines character embeddings to cope with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model contextual representations and it makes use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to classify each medical entity as either negated or not given the contextual dense representation. Moreover, we explored both embeddings created from words and embeddings created from lemmas. The best results were obtained with the lemmatized embeddings. Apparently, this approach reinforced the capability of the LSTMs to cope with the high lexical variability. The f-measure for exact-match was 65.1 and 82.4 for the partial-match.","Santiso, PÃƒÂ©rez, Casillas, Oronoz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103419","20200519","Deep learning; Electronic health records; Natural language processing; Negation detection; Text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16940,""
"Nursing in the Age of Artificial Intelligence: Protocol for a Scoping Review","It is predicted that digital health technologies that incorporate artificial intelligence will transform health care delivery in the next decade.

"Machine learning applied to retinal image processing for glaucoma detection: review and perspective","This is a systematic review on the main algorithms using machine learning (ML) in retinal image processing for glaucoma diagnosis and detection. ML has proven to be a significant tool for the development of computer aided technology. Furthermore, secondary research has been widely conducted over the years for ophthalmologists. Such aspects indicate the importance of ML in the context of retinal image processing. The publications that were chosen to compose this review were gathered from Scopus, PubMed, IEEEXplore and Science Direct databases. Then, the papers published between 2014 and 2019 were selected . Researches that used the segmented optic disc method were excluded. Moreover, only the methods which applied the classification process were considered. The systematic analysis was performed in such studies and, thereupon, the results were summarized. Based on architectures used for ML in retinal image processing, some studies applied feature extraction and dimensionality reduction to detect and isolate important parts of the analyzed image. Differently, other works utilized a deep convolutional network. Based on the evaluated researches, the main difference between the architectures is the number of images demanded for processing and the high computational cost required to use deep learning techniques. All the analyzed publications indicated it was possible to develop an automated system for glaucoma diagnosis. The disease severity and its high occurrence rates justify the researches which have been carried out. Recent computational techniques, such as deep learning, have shown to be promising technologies in fundus imaging. Although such a technique requires an extensive database and high computational costs, the studies show that the data augmentation and transfer learning techniques have been applied as an alternative way to optimize and reduce networks training.","Barros, Moura, Freire, Taleb, Valentim, Morais","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12938-020-00767-2","20200422","Classification; Deep learning; Glaucoma; Machine learning; Retinal image processing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16942,""

"Online Assessment of Applied Anatomy Knowledge: The Effect of Images on Medical Students' Performance","Anatomical examinations have been designed to assess topographical and/or applied knowledge of anatomy with or without the inclusion of visual resources such as cadaveric specimens or images, radiological images, and/or clinical photographs. Multimedia learning theories have advanced the understanding of how words and images are processed during learning. However, the evidence of the impact of including anatomical and radiological images within written assessments is sparse. This study investigates the impact of including images within clinically oriented single-best-answer questions on students' scores in a tailored online tool. Second-year medical students (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 174) from six schools in the United Kingdom participated voluntarily in the examination, and 55 students provided free-text comments which were thematically analyzed. All questions were categorized as to whether their stimulus format was purely textual or included an associated image. The type (anatomical and radiological image) and deep structure of images (question referring to a bone or soft tissue on the image) were taken into consideration. Students scored significantly better on questions with images compared to questions without images (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), and on questions referring to bones than to soft tissue (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), but no difference was found in their performance on anatomical and radiological image questions. The coding highlighted areas of &quot;test applicability&quot; and &quot;challenges faced by the students.&quot; In conclusion, images are critical in medical practice for investigating a patient's anatomy, and this study sets out a way to understand the effects of images on students' performance and their views in commonly employed written assessments.","Sagoo, Vorstenbosch, Bazira, Ellis, Kambouri, Owen","https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.1965","20200507","anatomy imaging; applied anatomy; gross anatomy education; medical education; online assessment; schemas; single-best answers; undergraduate education; visual psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16944,""
"Deep Learning for Ultrasound Localization Microscopy","By localizing microbubbles (MBs) in the vasculature, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) has recently been proposed, which greatly improves the spatial resolution of ultrasound (US) imaging and will be helpful for clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, several challenges remain in fast ULM imaging. The main problems are that current localization methods used to implement fast ULM imaging, e.g., a previously reported localization method based on sparse recovery (CS-ULM), suffer from long data-processing time and exhaustive parameter tuning (optimization). To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a ULM method based on deep learning, which is achieved by using a modified sub-pixel convolutional neural network (CNN), termed as mSPCN-ULM. Simulations and in vivo experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of mSPCN-ULM. Simulation results show that even if under high-density condition (6.4 MBs/mm<sup>2</sup>), a high localization precision ( [Formula: see text] in the lateral direction and [Formula: see text] in the axial direction) and a high localization reliability (Jaccard index of 0.66) can be obtained by mSPCN-ULM, compared to CS-ULM. The in vivo experimental results indicate that with plane wave scan at a transmit center frequency of 15.625 MHz, microvessels with diameters of [Formula: see text] can be detected and adjacent microvessels with a distance of [Formula: see text] can be separated. Furthermore, when using GPU acceleration, the data-processing time of mSPCN-ULM can be shortened to ~6 sec/frame in the simulations and ~23 sec/frame in the in vivo experiments, which is 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than CS-ULM. Finally, once the network is trained, mSPCN-ULM does not need parameter tuning to implement ULM. As a result, mSPCN-ULM opens the door to implement ULM with fast data-processing speed, high imaging accuracy, short data-acquisition time, and high flexibility (robustness to parameters) characteristics.","Liu, Zhou, Lu, Yang, He, Luo","https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2020.2986781","20201002","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16945,""
"Image Quality Assessment of Abdominal CT by Use of New Deep Learning Image Reconstruction: Initial Experience","<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to perform quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) algorithm in contrast-enhanced oncologic CT of the abdomen. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> Retrospective review (April-May 2019) of the cases of adults undergoing oncologic staging with portal venous phase abdominal CT was conducted for evaluation of standard 30% adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction V (30% ASIR-V) reconstruction compared with DLIR at low, medium, and high strengths. Attenuation and noise measurements were performed. Two radiologists, blinded to examination details, scored six categories while comparing reconstructions for overall image quality, lesion diagnostic confidence, artifacts, image noise and texture, lesion conspicuity, and resolution. <b>RESULTS.</b> DLIR had a better contrast-to-noise ratio than 30% ASIR-V did; high-strength DLIR performed the best. High-strength DLIR was associated with 47% reduction in noise, resulting in a 92-94% increase in contrast-to-noise ratio compared with that of 30% ASIR-V. For overall image quality and image noise and texture, DLIR scored significantly higher than 30% ASIR-V with significantly higher scores as DLIR strength increased. A total of 193 lesions were identified. The lesion diagnostic confidence, conspicuity, and artifact scores were significantly higher for all DLIR levels than for 30% ASIR-V. There was no significant difference in perceived resolution between the reconstruction methods. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Compared with 30% ASIR-V, DLIR improved CT evaluation of the abdomen in the portal venous phase. DLIR strength should be chosen to balance the degree of desired denoising for a clinical task relative to mild blurring, which increases with progressively higher DLIR strengths.","Jensen, Liu, Tamm, Chandler, Sun, Morani, Javadi, Wagner-Bartak","https://doi.org/10.2214/AJR.19.22332","20200826","artificial intelligence; deep learning; iterative reconstruction; radiation reduction; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Contrast Media; Deep Learning; Digestive System Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Iohexol; Male; Middle Aged; Radiation Dosage; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Radiography, Abdominal; Retrospective Studies; Thoracic Neoplasms; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16946,""
"Economic evaluations in migraine: systematic literature review and a novel approach","<b>Background:</b> For novel migraine therapies, economic evaluations will be required to understand the trade-offs between additional health benefit and additional cost. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify previous economic evaluations in migraine from the United Kingdom or Irish perspective to critically appraise these evaluations and to propose, if necessary, a novel modelling approach that can be used for future economic evaluations of migraine therapies.<b>Methods:</b> An SLR was conducted to identify previous economic evaluations of preventive migraine treatments. Key opinion leaders were consulted to determine the criteria for a robust migraine economic evaluation. Economic evaluations identified in the SLR were appraised against these criteria, and a novel cost-effectiveness model structure was then proposed.<b>Results:</b> Eight records reporting on published economic evaluations were identified and critically appraised for general quality. Expert consultation provided 6 recommendations on the ideal model structure for migraine that is both clinically and economically meaningful. A decision-tree plus Markov structure was then developed as a cost-effectiveness model for migraine therapies where each health state is associated with a patient distribution across monthly migraine day (MMD) frequencies.<b>Conclusions:</b> Future migraine economic evaluations should allow for assessments across the full spectrum of migraine, a response-based stopping rule, and the estimation of benefits and resource costs based on MMD frequency. The approach proposed in this paper captures all of the desired elements for an economic evaluation of migraine therapy and is suitable to assess new migraine therapies.","Mahon, Huels, Hacking, Cooney, Danyliv, Vudumula, Vadapalle, Vo, Maniyar, Palmer, Goadsby","https://doi.org/10.1080/13696998.2020.1754840","20200730","C52; CGRP; I11; I15; Model; chronic migraine; economic evaluation; episodic migraine; headache; systematic literature review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16947,""
"Application of particle swarm optimization to water management: an introduction and overview","Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the interactions of individuals in a social world. This algorithm is widely applied in different fields of water resources problems. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the basic PSO algorithm search strategy and PSO's applications and performance analysis in water resources engineering optimization problems. Our literature review revealed 22 different varieties of the PSO algorithm. The characteristics of each PSO variety together with their applications in different fields of water resources engineering (e.g., reservoir operation, rainfall-runoff modeling, water quality modeling, and groundwater modeling) are highlighted. The performances of different PSO variants were compared with other evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and mathematical optimization methods. The review evaluates the capability and comparative performance of PSO variants over conventional EAs (e.g., simulated annealing, differential evolution, genetic algorithm, and shark algorithm) and mathematical methods (e.g., support vector machine and differential dynamic programming) in terms of proper convergence to optimal Pareto fronts, faster convergence rate, and diversity of computed solutions.","Jahandideh-Tehrani, Bozorg-Haddad, LoÃƒÂ¡iciga","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-8228-z","20200626","Evolutionary algorithm; Particle swarm optimization; State-of-art review; Water resources; Algorithms; Conservation of Water Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Support Vector Machine; Water; Water Resources","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16948,""
"Artificial intelligence-assisted prediction of preeclampsia: Development and external validation of a nationwide health insurance dataset of the BPJS Kesehatan in Indonesia","We developed and validated an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted prediction of preeclampsia applied to a nationwide health insurance dataset in Indonesia. The BPJS Kesehatan dataset have been preprocessed using a nested case-control design into preeclampsia/eclampsia (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3318) and normotensive pregnant women (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 19,883) from all women with one pregnancy. The dataset provided 95 features consisting of demographic variables and medical histories started from 24 months to event and ended by delivery as the event. Six algorithms were compared by area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) with a subgroup analysis by time to the event. We compared our model to similar prediction models from systematically reviewed studies. In addition, we conducted a text mining analysis based on natural language processing techniques to interpret our modeling results. The best model consisted of 17 predictors extracted by a random forest algorithm. NineÃ¢Ë†Â¼12 months to the event was the period that had the best AUROC in external validation by either geographical (0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-0.89) or temporal split (0.86, 95% CI 0.85-0.86). We compared this model to prediction models in seven studies from 869 records in PUBMED, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. This model outperformed the previous models in terms of the precision, sensitivity, and specificity in all validation sets. Our low-cost model improved preliminary prediction to decide pregnant women that will be predicted by the models with high specificity and advanced predictors. This work was supported by grant no.

"A Social Media Study on the Effects of Psychiatric Medication Use","Understanding the effects of psychiatric medications during mental health treatment constitutes an active area of inquiry. While clinical trials help evaluate the effects of these medications, many trials suffer from a lack of generalizability to broader populations. We leverage social media data to examine psychopathological effects subject to self-reported usage of psychiatric medication. Using a list of common approved and regulated psychiatric drugs and a Twitter dataset of 300M posts from 30K individuals, we develop machine learning models to first assess effects relating to mood, cognition, depression, anxiety, psychosis, and suicidal ideation. Then, based on a stratified propensity score based causal analysis, we observe that use of specific drugs are associated with characteristic changes in an individual's psychopathology. We situate these observations in the psychiatry literature, with a deeper analysis of pre-treatment cues that predict treatment outcomes. Our work bears potential to inspire novel clinical investigations and to build tools for digital therapeutics.","Saha, Sugar, Torous, Abrahao, KÃ„Â±cÃ„Â±man, De Choudhury","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Social+Media+Study+on+the+Effects+of+Psychiatric+Medication+Use.","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16950,""
"Enabling pregnant women and their physicians to make informed medication decisions using artificial intelligence","The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare for pregnant women. To assess the role of AI in women's health, discover gaps, and discuss the future of AI in maternal health. A systematic review of English articles using EMBASE, PubMed, and SCOPUS. Search terms included pregnancy and AI. Research articles and book chapters were included, while conference papers, editorials and notes were excluded from the review. Included papers focused on pregnancy and AI methods, and pertained to pharmacologic interventions. We identified 376 distinct studies from our queries. A final set of 31 papers were included for the review. Included papers represented a variety of pregnancy concerns and multidisciplinary applications of AI. Few studies relate to pregnancy, AI, and pharmacologics and therefore, we review carefully those studies. External validation of models and techniques described in the studies is limited, impeding on generalizability of the studies. Our review describes how AI has been applied to address maternal health, throughout the pregnancy process: preconception, prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal health concerns. However, there is a lack of research applying AI methods to understand how pharmacologic treatments affect pregnancy. We identify three areas where AI methods could be used to improve our understanding of pharmacological effects of pregnancy, including: (a) obtaining sound and reliable data from clinical records (15 studies), (b) designing optimized animal experiments to validate specific hypotheses (1 study) to (c) implementing decision support systems that inform decision-making (11 studies). The largest literature gap that we identified is with regards to using AI methods to optimize translational studies between animals and humans for pregnancy-related drug exposures.","Davidson, Boland","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10928-020-09685-1","20200917","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Literature review; Machine learning; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16951,""
"Interdisciplinarity: An essential requirement for translation of radiomics research into clinical practice -a systematic review focused on thoracic oncology","Recently, evidence has accumulated that demonstrates the potential for future applications of radiomics in many clinical settings, including thoracic oncology. Methodological reasons for the immaturity of image mining (radiomics and artificial intelligence-based) studies have been identified. However, data on the influence of the composition of the research team on the quality of investigations in radiomics are lacking. This review aims to evaluate the interdisciplinarity within studies on radiomics in thoracic oncology in order to assess its influence on the quality of research (QUADAS-2 score) in the image mining field. We considered for inclusion radiomics investigations with objectives relating to clinical practice in thoracic oncology. Subsequently, we interviewed the corresponding authors. The field of expertise and/or educational degree was then used to assess interdisciplinarity. Subsequently, all studies were evaluated applying the QUADAS-2 score and assigned to a research phase from 0 to IV. Overall, 27 studies were included. The study quality according to the QUADAS-2 score was low (score Ã¢â€°Â¤5) in 8, moderate (=6) in 12, and high (Ã¢â€°Â¥7) in 7 papers. An interdisciplinary team (at least 3 different expertise categories) was involved in half of the papers without any type of validation and in all papers with independent validation. Clinicians were not involved in phase 0 studies while they contributed to all papers classified as phase I and to 4/5 papers classified as phase II with independent validation. The composition of the research team influences the quality of investigations in radiomics. Also, growth in interdisciplinarity appears to reflect research development from the early phase to a more mature, clinically oriented stage of investigation.","Sollini, Gelardi, Matassa, Delgado Bolton, Chiti, Kirienko","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.remn.2019.10.003","20200526","Authorship; AutorÃƒÂ­a; CÃƒÂ¡ncer de pulmÃƒÂ³n; Interdisciplinar; Interdisciplinarity; Lung cancer; Neoplasias tÃƒÂ­micas; Radiomics; RadiÃƒÂ³mica; Thymic neoplasms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16952,""
"China's CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from coal mining: A review of current bottom-up inventories","As the world's largest CH<sub>4</sub> emitter, China's CH<sub>4</sub> emissions contribute to climate change more than the amount emitted by many developed countries combined. The rapid growth of China's coal demand has important implications for CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from coal mining or coal mine methane (CMM) emissions. This paper aims to present an overview of bottom-up estimation of China's CMM emissions, including the trend in the last four decades and the limitations of current understanding on CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. Although characterized by significant differences in inventory compilation, statistically, the total CMM emissions rose from 4.64 to 16.41 Tg with a peak of 21.48 Tg from 1980 to 2016. Large discrepancies of inventory results existed in previous studies, which were affected by the coverage of emission sources, emission factors and activity-level data. The disagreements can be largely attributable to the emission factors of underground mining, which contain substantial variances in both spatial and temporal dimensions. To develop more reliable CMM inventories and make targeted mitigation measures, more attention should be paid to the transparency of the estimated results, coal statistics, on-site CMM emission factors, and the emissions from abandoned coal mines. As the leading CH<sub>4</sub> emission source in China, the estimations of CMM emissions urgently need to overcome existing and emerging challenges for compiling a consistent and accurate inventory.","Gao, Guan, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138295","20200527","China; Coal mining; Greenhouse gas emission inventories; Literature review; Methane emissions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16953,""
"Automated quality control in nuclear medicine using the structured noise index","Daily flood-field uniformity evaluation serves as the central element of nuclear medicine (NM) quality control (QC) programs. Uniformity images are traditionally analyzed using pixel value-based metrics, that is, integral uniformity (IU), which often fail to capture subtle structure and patterns caused by changes in gamma camera performance, requiring visual inspections which are subjective and time demanding. The goal of this project was to implement an advanced QC metrology for NM to effectively identify nonuniformity issues, and report issues in a timely manner for efficient correction prior to clinical use. The project involved the implementation of the program over a 2-year period at a multisite major medical institution. Using a previously developed quantitative uniformity analysis metric, the structured noise index (SNI) [Nelson et al. (2014), \textit{J Nucl Med.}, \textbf{55}:169-174], an automated QC process was developed to analyze, archive, and report on daily NM QC uniformity images. Clinical implementation of the newly developed program ran in parallel with the manufacturer's reported IU-based QC program. The effectiveness of the SNI program was evaluated over a 21-month period using sensitivity and coefficient of variation statistics. A total of 7365 uniformity QC images were analyzed. Lower level SNI alerts were generated in 12.5% of images and upper level alerts in 1.7%. Intervention due to image quality issues occurred on 26 instances; the SNI metric identified 24, while the IU metric identified eight. The SNI metric reported five upper level alerts where no clinical engineering intervention was deemed necessary. An SNI-based QC program provides a robust quantification of the performance of gamma camera uniformity. It operates seamlessly across a fleet of multiple camera models and, additionally, provides effective workflow among the clinical staff. The reliability of this process could eliminate the need for visual inspection of each image, saving valuable time, while enabling quantitative analysis of inter- and intrasystem performance.","Nelson, Samei","https://doi.org/10.1002/acm2.12850","20200422","Gamma camera; automated analysis; quality assurance; uniformity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16954,""
"Data normalization strategies in metabolomics: Current challenges, approaches, and tools","Data normalization is a big challenge in quantitative metabolomics approaches, whether targeted or untargeted. Without proper normalization, the mass-spectrometry and spectroscopy data can provide erroneous, sub-optimal data, which can lead to misleading and confusing biological results and thereby result in failed application to human healthcare, clinical, and other research avenues. To address this issue, a number of statistical approaches and software tools have been proposed in the literature and implemented over the years, thereby providing a multitude of approaches to choose from - either sample-based or data-based normalization strategies. In recent years, new dedicated software tools for metabolomics data normalization have surfaced as well. In this account article, I summarize the existing approaches and the new discoveries and research findings in this area of metabolomics data normalization, and I introduce some recent tools that aid in data normalization.","Misra","https://doi.org/10.1177/1469066720918446","20200925","Metabolite; normalization; quantification; sample; software; Animals; Data Analysis; Data Mining; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolomics; Software","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16955,""

"Aceso: PICO-guided Evidence Summarization on Medical Literature","Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) aims to apply the best available evidence gained from scientific methods to clinical decision making. A generally accepted criterion to formulate evidence is to use the PICO framework, where PICO stands for Problem/Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome. Automatic extraction of PICO-related sentences from medical literature is crucial to the success of many EBM applications. In this work, we present our Aceso system, which automatically generates PICO-based evidence summaries from medical literature. In Aceso <sup>1</sup>, we adopt an active learning paradigm, which helps to minimize the cost of manual labeling and to optimize the quality of summarization with limited labeled data. An UMLS2Vec model is proposed to learn a vector representation of medical concepts in UMLS <sup>2</sup>, and we fuse the embedding of medical knowledge with textual features in summarization. The evaluation shows that our approach is better on identifying PICO sentences against state-of-the-art studies and outperforms baseline methods on producing high-quality evidence summaries.","Zhang, Geng, Zhang, Lu, Gao, Mei","https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.2984704","20200805","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16957,""
"Financial analysis of large-volume delayed sampling to reduce bacterial contamination of platelets","Effective and financially viable mitigation approaches are needed to reduce bacterial contamination of platelets in the US. Expected costs of large-volume delayed sampling (LVDS), which would be performed by a blood center prior to shipment to a hospital, were compared to those of pathogen reduction (PR), point-of-release testing (PORt), and secondary bacterial culture (SBC). Using a Markov-based decision-tree model, the financial and clinical impact of implementing all variants of LVDS, PR, PORt, and SBC described in FDA guidance were evaluated from a hospital perspective. Hospitals were assumed to acquire leukoreduced apheresis platelets, with LVDS adding $30 per unit. Monte Carlo simulations were run to estimate the direct medical costs for platelet acquisition, testing, transfusion, and possible complications associated with each approach. Input parameters, including test sensitivity and specificity, were drawn from existing literature and costs (2018US$) were based on a hospital perspective. A one-way sensitivity analysis varied the assumed additional cost of LVDS. Under an approach of LVDS (7-day), the total cost per transfused unit is $735.78, which falls between estimates for SBC (7-day) and PORt. Assuming 20,000 transfusions each year, LVDS would cost $14.72 million annually. Per-unit LVDS costs would need to be less than $22.32 to be cheaper per transfusion than all other strategies, less than $32.02 to be cheaper than SBC (7-day), and less than $196.19 to be cheaper than PR (5-day). LVDS is an effective and cost-competitive approach, assuming additional costs to blood centers and associated charges to hospitals are modest.","Kacker, Katz, Ness, Bloch, Goel, Gehrie, Lokhandwala, Tobian","https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.15773","20200908","Bacterial Infections; Blood Banks; Blood Platelets; Blood Safety; Blood Specimen Collection; Costs and Cost Analysis; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Drug Contamination; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Implementation Science; Infection Control; Microbiological Techniques; Platelet Transfusion; Plateletpheresis; Primary Cell Culture; Risk Reduction Behavior; Sample Size; Time Factors; Time-to-Treatment; Transfusion Reaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16958,""
"Using Artificial Intelligence for Predicting Survival of Individual Grafts in Liver Transplantation: A Systematic Review","The demand for liver transplantation far outstrips the supply of deceased donor organs, and so, listing and allocation decisions aim to maximize utility. Most existing methods for predicting transplant outcomes use basic methods, such as regression modeling, but newer artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have the potential to improve predictive accuracy. The aim was to perform a systematic review of studies predicting graft outcomes following deceased donor liver transplantation using AI techniques and to compare these findings to linear regression and standard predictive modeling: donor risk index (DRI), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), and Survival Outcome Following Liver Transplantation (SOFT). After reviewing available article databases, a total of 52 articles were reviewed for inclusion. Of these articles, 9 met the inclusion criteria, which reported outcomes from 18,771 liver transplants. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were the most commonly used methodology, being reported in 7 studies. Only 2 studies directly compared machine learning (ML) techniques to liver scoring modalities (i.e., DRI, SOFT, and balance of risk [BAR]). Both studies showed better prediction of individual organ survival with the optimal ANN model, reporting an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 0.82 compared with BAR (0.62) and SOFT (0.57), and the other ANN model gave an AUC ROC of 0.84 compared with a DRI (0.68) and SOFT (0.64). AI techniques can provide high accuracy in predicting graft survival based on donors and recipient variables. When compared with the standard techniques, AI methods are dynamic and are able to be trained and validated within every population. However, the high accuracy of AI may come at a cost of losing explainability (to patients and clinicians) on how the technology works.","Wingfield, Ceresa, Thorogood, Fleuriot, Knight","https://doi.org/10.1002/lt.25772","20201023","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16959,""
"Computing Skin Cutaneous Melanoma Outcome From the HLA-Alleles and Clinical Characteristics","Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) are essential components of the immune system that stimulate immune cells to provide protection and defense against cancer. Thousands of HLA alleles have been reported in the literature, but only a specific set of HLA alleles are present in an individual. The capability of the immune system to recognize cancer-associated mutations depends on the presence of a particular set of alleles, which elicit an immune response to fight against cancer. Therefore, the occurrence of specific HLA alleles affects the survival outcome of cancer patients. In the current study, prediction models were developed, using 401 cutaneous melanoma patients, to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients using their clinical data and HLA alleles. We observed that the presence of certain favorable superalleles like HLA-B<sup>Ã¢Ë†â€”</sup>55 (HR = 0.15, 95% CI 0.034-0.67), HLA-A<sup>Ã¢Ë†â€”</sup>01 (HR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8), is responsible for the improved OS. In contrast, the presence of certain unfavorable superalleles such as HLA-B<sup>Ã¢Ë†â€”</sup>50 (HR = 2.76, 95% CI 1.284-5.941), HLA-DRB1<sup>Ã¢Ë†â€”</sup>12 (HR = 3.44, 95% CI 1.64-7.2) is responsible for the poor survival. We developed prediction models using key 14 HLA superalleles, demographic, and clinical characteristics for predicting high-risk cutaneous melanoma patients and achieved HR = 4.52 (95% CI 3.088-6.609, <i>p</i>-value = 8.01E-15).

"Diagnostic accuracy of texture analysis and machine learning for quantification of liver fibrosis in MRI: correlation with MR elastography and histopathology","To compare the diagnostic accuracy of texture analysis (TA)-derived parameters combined with machine learning (ML) of non-contrast-enhanced T1w and T2w fat-saturated (fs) images with MR elastography (MRE) for liver fibrosis quantification. In this IRB-approved prospective study, liver MRIs of participants with suspected chronic liver disease who underwent liver biopsy between August 2015 and May 2018 were analyzed. Two readers blinded to clinical and histopathological findings performed TA. The participants were categorized into no or low-stage (0-2) and high-stage (3-4) fibrosis groups. Confusion matrices were calculated using a support vector machine combined with principal component analysis. The diagnostic accuracy of ML-based TA of liver fibrosis and MRE was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). Histopathology served as reference standard. A total of 62 consecutive participants (40 men; mean age Ã‚Â± standard deviation, 48Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°13Ã‚Â years) were included. The accuracy of TA and ML on T1w was 85.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 63.7-97.0) and 61.9% (95% CI 38.4-81.9) on T2w fs for classification of liver fibrosis into low-stage and high-stage fibrosis. The AUC for TA on T1w was similar to MRE (0.82 [95% CI 0.59-0.95] vs. 0.92 [95% CI 0.71-0.99], pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.41), while the AUC for T2w fs was significantly lower compared to MRE (0.57 [95% CI 0.34-0.78] vs. 0.92 [95% CI 0.71-0.99], pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.008). Our results suggest that liver fibrosis can be quantified with TA-derived parameters of T1w when combined with a ML algorithm with similar accuracy compared to MRE. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Liver fibrosis can be categorized into low-stage fibrosis (0-2) and high-stage fibrosis (3-4) using texture analysis-derived parameters of T1-weighted images with a machine learning approach.

"Use of electronic medical records in development and validation of risk prediction models of hospital readmission: systematic review","To provide focused evaluation of predictive modeling of electronic medical record (EMR) data to predict 30 day hospital readmission. Systematic review. Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus from January 2015 to January 2019. All studies of predictive models for 28 day or 30 day hospital readmission that used EMR data. Characteristics of included studies, methods of prediction, predictive features, and performance of predictive models. Of 4442 citations reviewed, 41 studies met the inclusion criteria. Seventeen models predicted risk of readmission for all patients and 24 developed predictions for patient specific populations, with 13 of those being developed for patients with heart conditions. Except for two studies from the UK and Israel, all were from the US. The total sample size for each model ranged between 349 and 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°195Ã¢â‚¬â€°640. Twenty five models used a split sample validation technique. Seventeen of 41 studies reported C statistics of 0.75 or greater. Fifteen models used calibration techniques to further refine the model. Using EMR data enabled final predictive models to use a wide variety of clinical measures such as laboratory results and vital signs; however, use of socioeconomic features or functional status was rare. Using natural language processing, three models were able to extract relevant psychosocial features, which substantially improved their predictions. Twenty six studies used logistic or Cox regression models, and the rest used machine learning methods. No statistically significant difference (difference 0.03, 95% confidence interval -0.0 to 0.07) was found between average C statistics of models developed using regression methods (0.71, 0.68 to 0.73) and machine learning (0.74, 0.71 to 0.77). On average, prediction models using EMR data have better predictive performance than those using administrative data. However, this improvement remains modest. Most of the studies examined lacked inclusion of socioeconomic features, failed to calibrate the models, neglected to conduct rigorous diagnostic testing, and did not discuss clinical impact.","Mahmoudi, Kamdar, Kim, Gonzales, Singh, Waljee","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m958","20200410","Adult; Electronic Health Records; Female; Humans; Israel; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Patient Readmission; Risk Assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16963,""
"A low-cost texture-based pipeline for predicting myocardial tissue remodeling and fibrosis using cardiac ultrasound","Maturation of ultrasound myocardial tissue characterization may have far-reaching implications as a widely available alternative to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) for risk stratification in left ventricular (LV) remodeling. We extracted 328 texture-based features of myocardium from still ultrasound images. After we explored the phenotypes of myocardial textures using unsupervised similarity networks, global LV remodeling parameters were predicted using supervised machine learning models. Separately, we also developed supervised models for predicting the presence of myocardial fibrosis using another cohort who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). For the prediction, patients were divided into a training and test set (80:20). Texture-based tissue feature extraction was feasible in 97% of total 534 patients. Interpatient similarity analysis delineated two patient groups based on the texture features: one group had more advanced LV remodeling parameters compared to the other group. Furthermore, this group was associated with a higher incidence of cardiac deaths (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001) and major adverse cardiac events (p &lt; 0.001). The supervised models predicted reduced LV ejection fraction (&lt;50%) and global longitudinal strain (&lt;16%) with area under the receiver-operator-characteristics curves (ROC AUC) of 0.83 and 0.87 in the hold-out test set, respectively. Furthermore, the presence of myocardial fibrosis was predicted from only ultrasound myocardial texture with an ROC AUC of 0.84 (sensitivity 86.4% and specificity 83.3%) in the test set. Ultrasound texture-based myocardial tissue characterization identified phenotypic features of LV remodeling from still ultrasound images. Further clinical validation may address critical barriers in the adoption of ultrasound techniques for myocardial tissue characterization.

"The impact of deep convolutional neural network-based artificial intelligence on colonoscopy outcomes: A systematic review with meta-analysis","The utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in colonoscopy has gained popularity in current times. Recent trials have evaluated the efficacy of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based AI system in colonoscopy for improving adenoma detection rate (ADR) and polyp detection rate (PDR). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available studies to assess the impact of DCNN-based AI-assisted colonoscopy in improving the ADR and PDR. We queried the following database for this study: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Sciences, and Computers and Applied Sciences. We only included randomized controlled trials that compared AI colonoscopy to standard colonoscopy (SC). Our outcomes included ADR and PDR. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random effects model and DerSimonian-Laird approach for each outcome. A total of three studies with 2815 patients (1415 in SC group and 1400 in AI group) were included. AI colonoscopy resulted in significantly improved ADR (32.9% vs 20.8%, RR: 1.58, 95% CI 1.39-1.80, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) and PDR (43.0% vs 27.8%, RR: 1.55, 95% CI 1.39-1.72, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) compared with SC. Given the results and limitations, the utility of AI colonoscopy holds promise and should be evaluated in more randomized controlled trials across different population, especially in patients solely undergoing colonoscopy for screening purpose as improved ADR will ultimately help in reducing incident colorectal cancer.","Aziz, Fatima, Dong, Lee-Smith, Nawras","https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15070","20201012","artificial intelligence; colonoscopy; deep convolutional neural network; high-definition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16965,""
"Radiomics: A primer for the radiation oncologist","Radiomics are a set of methods used to leverage medical imaging and extract quantitative features that can characterize a patient's phenotype. All modalities can be used with several different software packages. Specific informatics methods can then be used to create meaningful predictive models. In this review, we will explain the major steps of a radiomics analysis pipeline and then present the studies published in the context of radiation therapy. A literature review was performed on Medline using the search engine PubMed. The search strategy included the search terms &quot;radiotherapy&quot;, &quot;radiation oncology&quot; and &quot;radiomics&quot;. The search was conducted in July 2019 and reference lists of selected articles were hand searched for relevance to this review. A typical radiomics workflow always includes five steps: imaging and segmenting, data curation and preparation, feature extraction, exploration and selection and finally modeling. In radiation oncology, radiomics studies have been published to explore different clinical outcome in lung (n=5), head and neck (n=5), esophageal (n=3), rectal (n=3), pancreatic (n=2) cancer and brain metastases (n=2). The quality of these retrospective studies is heterogeneous and their results have not been translated to the clinic. Radiomics has a great potential to predict clinical outcome and better personalize treatment. But the field is still young and constantly evolving. Improvement in bias reduction techniques and multicenter studies will hopefully allow more robust and generalizable models.","Bibault, Xing, Giraud, El Ayachy, Giraud, Decazes, Burgun, Giraud","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canrad.2020.01.011","20200722","Apprentissage profond; Clinical oncology; Clinique; Deep learning; Machine learning; Modeling; ModÃƒÂ©lisation; Oncologie; Radiation oncology; Radiomics; Radiomique; RadiothÃƒÂ©rapie; Brain Neoplasms; Data Analysis; Data Curation; Deep Learning; Diagnostic Imaging; Esophageal Neoplasms; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Neoplasms; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Phenotype; Radiation Oncologists; Radiotherapy; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Rectal Neoplasms; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16966,""
"Artificial Intelligence in Ophthalmology: A Meta-Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Retinal Vessels Segmentation","Accurate retinal vessel segmentation is often considered to be a reliable biomarker of diagnosis and screening of various diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetic, and ophthalmologic diseases. Recently, deep learning (DL) algorithms have demonstrated high performance in segmenting retinal images that may enable fast and lifesaving diagnoses. To our knowledge, there is no systematic review of the current work in this research area. Therefore, we performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis of relevant studies to quantify the performance of the DL algorithms in retinal vessel segmentation. A systematic search on EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted for studies that were published between 1 January 2000 and 15 January 2020. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) procedure. The DL-based study design was mandatory for a study's inclusion. Two authors independently screened all titles and abstracts against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for assessing the risk of bias and applicability. Thirty-one studies were included in the systematic review; however, only 23 studies met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. DL showed high performance for four publicly available databases, achieving an average area under the ROC of 0.96, 0.97, 0.96, and 0.94 on the DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, and HRF databases, respectively. The pooled sensitivity for the DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, and HRF databases was 0.77, 0.79, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively. Moreover, the pooled specificity of the DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, and HRF databases was 0.97, 0.97, 0.97, and 0.92, respectively. The findings of our study showed the DL algorithms had high sensitivity and specificity for segmenting the retinal vessels from digital fundus images. The future role of DL algorithms in retinal vessel segmentation is promising, especially for those countries with limited access to healthcare. More compressive studies and global efforts are mandatory for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of DL-based tools for retinal disease screening worldwide.","Islam, Poly, Walther, Yang, Li","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9041018","20200928","artificial intelligence; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diabetes mellitus; retinal vessel","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16967,""
"A Systematic Review of Estimating Breast Cancer Recurrence at the Population Level With Administrative Data","Exact numbers of breast cancer recurrences are currently unknown at the population level, because they are challenging to actively collect. Previously, real-world data such as administrative claims have been used within expert- or data-driven (machine learning) algorithms for estimating cancer recurrence. We present the first systematic review and meta-analysis, to our knowledge, of publications estimating breast cancer recurrence at the population level using algorithms based on administrative data. The systematic literature search followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. We evaluated and compared sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy of algorithms. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed using a generalized linear mixed model to obtain a pooled estimate of accuracy. Seventeen articles met the inclusion criteria. Most articles used information from medical files as the gold standard, defined as any recurrence. Two studies included bone metastases only in the definition of recurrence. Fewer studies used a model-based approach (decision trees or logistic regression) (41.2%) compared with studies using detection rules without specified model (58.8%). The generalized linear mixed model for all recurrence types reported an accuracy of 92.2% (95% confidence interval = 88.4% to 94.8%). Publications reporting algorithms for detecting breast cancer recurrence are limited in number and heterogeneous. A thorough analysis of the existing algorithms demonstrated the need for more standardization and validation. The meta-analysis reported a high accuracy overall, which indicates algorithms as promising tools to identify breast cancer recurrence at the population level. The rule-based approach combined with emerging machine learning algorithms could be interesting to explore in the future.","Izci, Tambuyzer, Tuand, Depoorter, Laenen, Wildiers, Vergote, Van Eycken, De Schutter, Verdoodt, Neven","https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djaa050","20201022","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16968,""
"Success of Face Analysis Technology in Rare Genetic Diseases Diagnosed by Whole-Exome Sequencing: A Single-Center Experience","The diagnosis of rare genetic diseases is one of the most difficult areas in medicine. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) technology makes it easier to diagnose these diseases. In addition, next-generation phenotyping can help to diagnose computer-based algorithms. Detailed dysmorphologic findings of 25 patients diagnosed by WES in our center were described. The success of this technology in diagnosing rare genetic diseases was investigated by scanning the photographs of 25 patients with Face2Gene application. The application listed possible preliminary diagnoses (30 disease suggestion). Of these, 12 (48%) cases were correctly matched. The most common disease group in the patients was neurological disease (96%). The most common mode of inheritance in the patients was autosomal recessive. The rate of consanguineous marriages was determined in 80% of the patients. Ten patients had microcephaly and 7 patients had corpus callosum anomaly. In our study, we found that the success of Face2Gene was lower than described in the literature. We think that the probable cause of this condition is that the cases are very rare, and there is not enough data about these diseases in the application. Therefore, it is recommended that applications should be used more frequently by pediatricians and clinical geneticists. The diagnosis of rare diseases still is quite difficult. Nowadays, WES is a successful method. However, applications such as Face2Gene help to make a clinical prediagnosis and create a larger database.","Elmas, Gogus","https://doi.org/10.1159/000505800","20200928","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Whole-exome sequencing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16969,""
"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Quantification Using CT Texture Analysis and Densitometry: Results From the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial","<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study is to establish whether texture analysis and densitometry are complementary quantitative measures of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a lung cancer screening setting. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> This was a retrospective study of data collected prospectively (in 2004-2010) in the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial. The texture score, relative area of emphysema, and percentile density were computed for 1915 baseline low-dose lung CT scans and were evaluated, both individually and in combination, for associations with lung function (i.e., forced expiratory volume in 1 second as a percentage of predicted normal [FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted]), diagnosis of mild to severe COPD, and prediction of a rapid decline in lung function. Multivariate linear regression models with lung function as the outcome were compared using the likelihood ratio test or the Vuong test, and AUC values for diagnostic and prognostic capabilities were compared using the DeLong test. <b>RESULTS.</b> Texture showed a significantly stronger association with lung function (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 vs densitometric measures), a significantly higher diagnostic AUC value (for COPD, 0.696; for Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grade 1, 0.648; for GOLD grade 2, 0.768; and for GOLD grade 3, 0.944; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 vs densitometric measures), and a higher but not significantly different association with lung function decline. In addition, only texture could predict a rapid decline in lung function (AUC value, 0.538; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 vs random guessing). The combination of texture and both densitometric measures strengthened the association with lung function and decline in lung function (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 and <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, respectively, vs texture) but did not improve diagnostic or prognostic performance. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> The present study highlights texture as a promising quantitative CT measure of COPD to use alongside, or even instead of, densitometric measures. Moreover, texture may allow early detection of COPD in subjects who undergo lung cancer screening.","SÃƒÂ¸rensen, Nielsen, Petersen, Pedersen, Dirksen, de Bruijne","https://doi.org/10.2214/AJR.19.22300","20200702","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; densitometry; machine learning; quantitative CT; texture analysis; Aged; Denmark; Densitometry; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Pulmonary Emphysema; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Respiratory Function Tests; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16970,""
"Evidence synthesis relevant to COVID-19: a protocol for multiple systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews","The evidence on COVID-19 is being produced at high speed, so it is challenging for decision-makers to keep up. It seems appropriate, then, to put into practice a novel approach able to provide the scientific community and other interested parties with quality evidence that is actionable, and rapidly and efficiently produced. We designed a protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P). We will search for primary studies and systematic reviews that answer different questions related to COVID-19 using both a centralized repository (Epistemonikos database) and a manual search in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We will also search for literature in several other sources. At least two researchers will independently undertake the selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of the quality of the included studies. We will synthesize data for each question using meta-analysis, when possible, and we will prepare Summary of Findings tables according to the GRADE approach. All the evidence will be organized in an open platform (LÃ‚Â·OVE - Living OVerview of Evidence) that will be continuously updated using artificial intelligence and a broad network of experts.

"Can machine-learning methods really help predict suicide?","In recent years there has been interest in the use of machine learning in suicide research in reaction to the failure of traditional statistical methods to produce clinically useful models of future suicide. The current review summarizes recent prediction studies in the suicide literature including those using machine learning approaches to understand what value these novel approaches add. Studies using machine learning to predict suicide deaths report area under the curve that are only modestly greater than, and sensitivities that are equal to, those reported in studies using more conventional predictive methods. Positive predictive value remains around 1% among the cohort studies with a base rate that was not inflated by case-control methodology. Machine learning or artificial intelligence may afford opportunities in mental health research and in the clinical care of suicidal patients. However, application of such techniques should be carefully considered to avoid repeating the mistakes of existing methodologies.

"Economic Evaluation of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy by Site of Care Among Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Large B-Cell Lymphoma","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies are currently administered at a limited number of cancer centers and are primarily delivered in an inpatient setting. However, variations in total costs associated with these therapies remain unknown. To estimate the economic differences in the administration of CAR T-cell therapy by the site of care and the incidence of key adverse events. A decision-tree model was designed to capture clinical outcomes and associated costs during a predefined period (from lymphodepletion to 30 days after the receipt of CAR T-cell infusion) to account for the potential incidence of acute adverse events and to evaluate variations in total costs for the administration of CAR T-cell therapy by site of care. Cost estimates were from the health care practitioner perspective and were based on data obtained from the literature and publicly available databases, including the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample, the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System, the Medicare physician fee schedule, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, and the IBM Micromedex RED BOOK. The model evaluated an average adult patient with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma who received CAR T-cell therapy in an academic inpatient hospital or nonacademic specialty oncology network. The administration of CAR T-cell therapy. Total cost of the administration of CAR T-cell therapy by site of care. The costs associated with lymphodepletion, acquisition and infusion of CAR T cells, and management of acute adverse events were also examined. The estimated total cost of care associated with the administration of CAR T-cell therapy was $454Ã¢â‚¬Â¯611 (95% CI, $452Ã¢â‚¬Â¯466-$458Ã¢â‚¬Â¯267) in the academic hospital inpatient setting compared with $421Ã¢â‚¬Â¯624 (95% CI, $417Ã¢â‚¬Â¯204-$422Ã¢â‚¬Â¯325) in the nonacademic specialty oncology network setting, for a difference of $32Ã¢â‚¬Â¯987. After excluding the CAR T-cell acquisition cost, hospitalization and office visit costs were $53Ã¢â‚¬Â¯360 (65.3% of the total cost) in academic inpatient hospitals and $23Ã¢â‚¬Â¯526 (48.4% of the total cost) in nonacademic specialty oncology networks. The administration of CAR T-cell therapy in nonacademic specialty oncology networks was associated with a $29Ã¢â‚¬Â¯834 (55.9%) decrease in hospitalization and office visit costs and a $3154 (20.1%) decrease in procedure costs.

To examine the association of interventions aimed at optimizing PE in terms of quality (teaching strategies or fitness infusion) or quantity (lessons per week) with health-related physical fitness and FMSs in children and adolescents. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, studies were identified through a systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and SPORTDiscus databases (from inception to October 10, 2019) with the keywords physical education OR PE OR P.E. AND fitness AND motor ability OR skills. Manual examination of references in selected articles was also performed. Studies that assessed the association of quality- or quantity-based PE interventions with improvement in physical fitness and/or FMSs in youths (aged 3-18 years) were included. Data were processed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled effect size (Hedges g). Health-related physical fitness outcomes and FMSs. Fifty-six trials composed of 48Ã¢â‚¬Â¯185 youths (48% girls) were included in the meta-analysis. Quality-based PE interventions were associated with small increases in health-related physical fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness [Hedges gÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.24; 95% CI, 0.16-0.32] and muscular strength [Hedges gÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.19; 95% CI, 0.09-0.29]) and FMSs (Hedges gÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.38; 95% CI, 0.27-0.49). Subgroup analyses found stronger associations for quality-based PE interventions on body mass index (Hedges gÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.18; 95% CI, -0.26 to -0.09), body fat (Hedges gÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.28; 95% CI, -0.37 to -0.18), cardiorespiratory fitness (Hedges gÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.31; 95% CI, 0.23-0.39), and muscular strength (Hedges gÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.29; 95% CI, 0.18-0.39). Quantity-based PE interventions were associated with small increases in only cardiorespiratory fitness (Hedges gÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.42; 95% CI, 0.30-0.55), muscular strength (Hedges gÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.20; 95% CI, 0.08-0.31), and speed agility (Hedges gÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.29; 95% CI, 0.07-0.51). The findings suggest that quality-based PE interventions are associated with small increases in both student health-related physical fitness components and FMSs regardless of frequency or duration of PE lessons.

"Radiomics in gliomas: clinical implications of computational modeling and fractal-based analysis","Radiomics is an emerging field that involves extraction and quantification of features from medical images. These data can be mined through computational analysis and models to identify predictive image biomarkers that characterize intra-tumoral dynamics throughout the course of treatment. This is particularly difficult in gliomas, where heterogeneity has been well established at a molecular level as well as visually in conventional imaging. Thus, acquiring clinically useful features remains difficult due to temporal variations in tumor dynamics. Identifying surrogate biomarkers through radiomics may provide a non-invasive means of characterizing biologic activities of gliomas. We present an extensive literature review of radiomics-based analysis, with a particular focus on computational modeling, machine learning, and fractal-based analysis in improving differential diagnosis and predicting clinical outcomes. Novel strategies in extracting quantitative features, segmentation methods, and their clinical applications are producingÃ‚Â promising results. Moreover, we provide a detailed summary of the morphometric parameters that have so far been proposed as a means of quantifying imaging characteristics of gliomas. Newly emerging radiomic techniques via machine learning and fractal-based analyses holds considerable potential for improving diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of gliomas. Key pointsÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Radiomic features can be mined through computational analysis to produce quantitative imaging biomarkers that characterize intra-tumoral dynamics throughout the course of treatment.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Surrogate image biomarkers identified through radiomics could enable a non-invasive means of characterizing biologic activities of gliomas.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ With novel analytic algorithms, quantification of morphological or sub-regional tumor features to predict survival outcomes is producing promising results.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Quantifying intra-tumoral heterogeneity may improve grading and molecular sub-classifications of gliomas.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Computational fractal-based analysis of gliomas allows geometrical evaluation of tumor irregularities and complexity, leading to novel techniques for tumor segmentation, grading, and therapeutic monitoring.","Jang, Russo, Di Ieva","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-020-02403-1","20200624","Computational modeling; Fractal analysis; Glioma; Machine learning; Radiomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16976,""
"Cost-effectiveness of introducing an MF59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine for older adults in Argentina","Influenza surveillance in Argentina reported influenza-like illness at a rate of 3500/100,000, a hospitalization rate of 15.5/100,000, and a death rate of 0.32/100,000 annually in adults aged over 65Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years. The high burden of disease may be due to a combination of immunosenescence and the suboptimal clinical effectiveness of conventional, non-adjuvanted influenza vaccines in this age group. There is a clinical need for more effective influenza vaccines in this population. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of an MF59Ã‚Â®-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV) in adults aged over 65Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years in Argentina compared with the non-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) used under the current national vaccination policy. A decision tree cost-effectiveness model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of switching from TIV to aTIV in Argentinian older adults. The model compared cost and health benefits of vaccination in one influenza season from the payer perspective. The main predictions included survival, quality-adjusted survival, and costs. Model inputs were sourced from Argentina or internationally where local data was considered inaccurate. Vaccine efficacy assumptions were extracted from recently published, peer-reviewed scientific literature. Switching from TIV to aTIV would result in 170 deaths averted and 1310 incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY was US $2660.59 from the payer perspective. In all sensitivity analyses, aTIV remained highly cost-effective. The probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed a 95% CI per QALY of US $113.74-7721.67. Introducing an adjuvanted influenza vaccine in Argentina is potentially beneficial and cost-effective relative to the currently-used TIV through the reduction of disease burden and utilization of healthcare resources.","Nguyen, Vizzotti, Uruena, Giglio, Magneres, Richmond","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.02.081","20201002","Adjuvant; Argentina; Cost-effectiveness; Elderly; Influenza vaccine; Older adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16977,""
"Impact of image analysis and artificial intelligence in thyroid pathology, with particular reference to cytological aspects","Thyroid pathology has great potential for automated/artificial intelligence algorithm application as the incidence of thyroid nodules is increasing and the indeterminate interpretation rate of fine-needle aspiration remains relatively high. The aim of the study is to review the published literature on automated image analysis and artificial intelligence applications to thyroid pathology with whole-slide imaging. Systematic search was carried out in electronic databases. Studies dealing with thyroid pathology and use of automated algorithms applied to whole-slide imaging were included. Quality of studies was assessed with a modified QUADAS-2 tool. Of 919 retrieved articles, 19 were included. The main themes addressed were the comparison of automated assessment of immunohistochemical staining with manual pathologist's assessment, quantification of differences in cellular and nuclear parameters among tumour entities, and discrimination between benign and malignant nodules. Correlation coefficients with manual assessment were higher than 0.76 and diagnostic performance of automated models was comparable with an expert pathologist diagnosis. Computational difficulties were related to the large size of whole-slide images. Overall, the results are promising and it is likely that, with the resolution of technical issues, the application of automated algorithms in thyroid pathology will increase and be adopted following suitable validation studies.","Girolami, Marletta, Pantanowitz, Torresani, Ghimenton, Barbareschi, Scarpa, Brunelli, Barresi, Trimboli, Eccher","https://doi.org/10.1111/cyt.12828","20200831","artificial intelligence; digital pathology; image analysis; systematic review; thyroid; whole-slide imaging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16978,""
"Epileptic Seizure Classification With Symmetric and Hybrid Bilinear Models","Epilepsy affects nearly [Formula: see text] of the global population, of which two thirds can be treated by anti-epileptic drugs and a much lower percentage by surgery. Diagnostic procedures for epilepsy and monitoring are highly specialized and labour-intensive. The accuracy of the diagnosis is also complicated by overlapping medical symptoms, varying levels of experience and inter-observer variability among clinical professions. This paper proposes a novel hybrid bilinear deep learning network with an application in the clinical procedures of epilepsy classification diagnosis, where the use of surface electroencephalogram (sEEG) and audiovisual monitoring is standard practice. Hybrid bilinear models based on two types of feature extractors, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are trained using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of one-second sEEG. In the proposed hybrid models, CNNs extract spatio-temporal patterns, while RNNs focus on the characteristics of temporal dynamics in relatively longer intervals given the same input data. Second-order features, based on interactions between these spatio-temporal features are further explored by bilinear pooling and used for epilepsy classification. Our proposed methods obtain an F1-score of [Formula: see text] on the Temple University Hospital Seizure Corpus and [Formula: see text] on the EPILEPSIAE dataset, comparing favourably to existing benchmarks for sEEG-based seizure type classification.

"Positron-emission tomography-guided radiation therapy: Ongoing projects and future hopes","Radiation therapy has undergone significant advances these last decades, particularly thanks to technical improvements, computer science and a better ability to define the target volumes via morphological and functional imaging breakthroughs. Imaging contributes to all three stages of patient care in radiation oncology: before, during and after treatment. Before the treatment, the choice of optimal imaging type and, if necessary, the adequate functional tracer will allow a better definition of the volume target. During radiation therapy, image-guidance aims at locating the tumour target and tailoring the volume target to anatomical and tumoral variations. Imaging systems are now integrated with conventional accelerators, and newer accelerators have techniques allowing tumour tracking during the irradiation. More recently, MRI-guided systems have been developed, and are already active in a few French centres. Finally, after radiotherapy, imaging plays a major role in most patients' monitoring, and must take into account post-radiation tissue modification specificities. In this review, we will focus on the ongoing projects of nuclear imaging in oncology, and how they can help the radiation oncologist to better treat patients. To this end, a literature review including the terms &quot;Radiotherapy&quot;, &quot;Radiation Oncology&quot; and &quot;PET-CT&quot; was performed in August 2019 on Medline and ClinicalTrials.gov. We chose to review successively these novelties organ-by-organ, focusing on the most promising advances. As a conclusion, the help of modern functional imaging thanks to a better definition and new specific radiopharmaceuticals tracers could allow even more precise treatments and enhanced surveillance. Finally, it could provide determinant information to artificial intelligence algorithms in &quot;-omics&quot; models.","Giraud, Popinat, Regaieg, Tonnelet, Vera","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canrad.2020.02.009","20200722","Clinical oncology; Functional imaging; Image-guided radiation therapy; Imagerie fonctionnelle; Oncologie clinique; Radiation oncology; RadiothÃƒÂ©rapie; RadiothÃƒÂ©rapie guidÃƒÂ©e par lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢image; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antigens, Surface; Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological; Brain Neoplasms; Esophageal Neoplasms; Forecasting; Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Lymphoma; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neoplasms; Particle Accelerators; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Prostatic Neoplasms; Radiopharmaceuticals; Radiotherapy, Image-Guided; Rectal Neoplasms; Sarcoma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16980,""
"Blended learning via distance in pre-registration nursing education: A scoping review","Prior to the Covid-19 global pandemic, we reviewed literature and identified comprehensive evidence of the efficacy of blended learning for pre-registration nursing students who learn across distances and/or via satellite campuses. Following a methodological framework, a scoping literature review was undertaken. We searched six databases (EBSCOHOST (CINHAL plus; Education research Complete; Australia/New Zealand Reference Centre); Google Scholar; EMBASE (Ovid) [ERIC (Ovid); Medline (Ovid)]; PubMed: ProQuest Education Journals &amp; ProQuest Nursing &amp; Allied Health Source) for the period 2005-December 2015. Critical appraisal for critiquing qualitative and quantitative studies was undertaken, as was a thematic analysis. Twenty-eight articles were included for review, which reported nursing research (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 23) and student experiences of blended learning in higher education (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5). Four key themes were identified in the literature: active learning, technological barriers, support, and communication. The results suggest that when delivered purposefully, blended learning can positively influence and impact on the achievements of students, especially when utilised to manage and support distance education. Further research is needed about satellite campuses with student nurses, to assist with the development of future educational practice.","Jowsey, Foster, Cooper-Ioelu, Jacobs","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nepr.2020.102775","20200428","Blended learning; Distance learning; Learning; Literature review; Pre-registration; Satellite campus; Coronavirus Infections; Education, Distance; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Humans; Learning; Nursing Education Research; Nursing Evaluation Research; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Students, Nursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16981,""
"A harmonized meta-knowledgebase of clinical interpretations of somatic genomic variants in cancer","Precision oncology relies on accurate discovery and interpretation of genomic variants, enabling individualized diagnosis, prognosis and therapy selection. We found that six prominent somatic cancer variant knowledgebases were highly disparate in content, structure and supporting primary literature, impeding consensus when evaluating variants and their relevance in a clinical setting. We developed a framework for harmonizing variant interpretations to produce a meta-knowledgebase of 12,856 aggregate interpretations. We demonstrated large gains in overlap between resources across variants, diseases and drugs as a result of this harmonization. We subsequently demonstrated improved matching between a patient cohort and harmonized interpretations of potential clinical significance, observing an increase from an average of 33% per individual knowledgebase to 57% in aggregate. Our analyses illuminate the need for open, interoperable sharing of variant interpretation data. We also provide a freely available web interface (search.cancervariants.org) for exploring the harmonized interpretations from these six knowledgebases.","Wagner, Walsh, Mayfield, Tamborero, Sonkin, Krysiak, Deu-Pons, Duren, Gao, McMurry, Patterson, Del Vecchio Fitz, Pitel, Sezerman, Ellrott, Warner, Rieke, Aittokallio, Cerami, Ritter, Schriml, Freimuth, Haendel, Raca, Madhavan, Baudis, Beckmann, Dienstmann, Chakravarty, Li, Mockus, Elemento, Schultz, Lopez-Bigas, Lawler, Goecks, Griffith, Griffith, Margolin","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-020-0603-8","20200626","Databases, Genetic; Diploidy; Genetic Variation; Genomics; Humans; Knowledge Bases; Neoplasms; Precision Medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16982,""
"Consistency of the Tools That Predict the Impact of Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) on Gene Functionality: The <i>BRCA1</i> Gene","Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) occurring in a protein coding gene may disrupt its function in multiple ways. Predicting this disruption has been recognized as an important problem in bioinformatics research. Many tools, hereafter p-tools, have been designed to perform these predictions and many of them are now of common use in scientific research, even in clinical applications. This highlights the importance of understanding the semantics of their outputs. To shed light on this issue, two questions are formulated, (i) do p-tools provide similar predictions? (inner consistency), and (ii) are these predictions consistent with the literature? (outer consistency). To answer these, six p-tools are evaluated with exhaustive SNV datasets from the <i>BRCA1</i> gene. Two indices, called K a l l and K s t r o n g , are proposed to quantify the inner consistency of pairs of p-tools while the outer consistency is quantified by standard information retrieval metrics. While the inner consistency analysis reveals that most of the p-tools are not consistent with each other, the outer consistency analysis reveals they are characterized by a low prediction performance. Although this result highlights the need of improving the prediction performance of individual p-tools, the inner consistency results pave the way to the systematic design of truly diverse ensembles of p-tools that can overcome the limitations of individual members.","Murillo, Spetale, Guillaume, Bulacio, Garcia Labari, Cailloux, Destercke, Tapia","https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10030475","20200918","BRCA1 gene; SNV; consistency of tools; prediction tools; preference relations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16983,""
"Automatic Annotation of Narrative Radiology Reports","Narrative texts in electronic health records can be efficiently utilized for building decision support systems in the clinic, only if they are correctly interpreted automatically in accordance with a specified standard. This paper tackles the problem of developing an automated method of labeling free-form radiology reports, as a precursor for building query-capable report databases in hospitals. The analyzed dataset consists of 1295 radiology reports concerning the condition of a knee, retrospectively gathered at the Clinical Hospital Centre Rijeka, Croatia. Reports were manually labeled with one or more labels from a set of 10 most commonly occurring clinical conditions. After primary preprocessing of the texts, two sets of text classification methods were compared: (1) traditional classification models-Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF)-coupled with Bag-of-Words (BoW) features (i.e., symbolic text representation) and (2) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) coupled with dense word vectors (i.e., word embeddings as a semantic text representation) as input features. We resorted to nested 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of competing methods using accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 score. The CNN with semantic word representations as input yielded the overall best performance, having a micro-averaged F 1 score of 86 . 7 % . The CNN classifier yielded particularly encouraging results for the most represented conditions: degenerative disease ( 95 . 9 % ), arthrosis ( 93 . 3 % ), and injury ( 89 . 2 % ). As a data-hungry deep learning model, the CNN, however, performed notably worse than the competing models on underrepresented classes with fewer training instances such as multicausal disease or metabolic disease. LR, RF, and SVM performed comparably well, with the obtained micro-averaged F 1 scores of 84 . 6 % , 82 . 2 % , and 82 . 1 % , respectively.","Krsnik, GlavaÃ…Â¡, Krsnik, MiletiÃ„â€¡, Ã…Â tajduhar","https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10040196","20200928","automatic labeling; decision support system; free-form radiology report; knee; machine learning; natural language processing; word embedding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16984,""
"Applications of Machine Learning Predictive Models in the Chronic Disease Diagnosis","This paper reviews applications of machine learning (ML) predictive models in the diagnosis of chronic diseases. Chronic diseases (CDs) are responsible for a major portion of global health costs. Patients who suffer from these diseases need lifelong treatment. Nowadays, predictive models are frequently applied in the diagnosis and forecasting of these diseases. In this study, we reviewed the state-of-the-art approaches that encompass ML models in the primary diagnosis of CD. This analysis covers 453 papers published between 2015 and 2019, and our document search was conducted from PubMed (Medline), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) libraries. Ultimately, 22 studies were selected to present all modeling methods in a precise way that explains CD diagnosis and usage models of individual pathologies with associated strengths and limitations. Our outcomes suggest that there are no standard methods to determine the best approach in real-time clinical practice since each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Among the methods considered, support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), clustering were the most commonly used. These models are highly applicable in classification, and diagnosis of CD and are expected to become more important in medical practice in the near future.","Battineni, Sagaro, Chinatalapudi, Amenta","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm10020021","20200928","accuracy; chronic diseases; disease classification; pathologies; prediction models","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16985,""
"Academic Outcomes of School-Aged Children Born Preterm: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Children born preterm are at an elevated risk of academic underachievement. However, the extent to which performance across domain-specific subskills in reading and mathematics is associated with preterm birth remains unclear. To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of academic outcomes of school-aged children born preterm, compared with children born at term, appraising evidence for higher- and lower-order subskills in reading and mathematics. PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature electronic databases from January 1, 1980, to July 30, 2018, were searched for population, exposure, and outcome terms such as child (population), preterm birth (exposure), and education* (outcome). Peer-reviewed English-language publications that included preterm-born children and a comparison group of term-born children aged 5 to 18 years and born during or after 1980 and that reported outcomes on standardized assessments from cohort or cross-sectional studies were screened. Of the 9833 articles screened, 33 unique studies met the inclusion criteria. Data were analyzed from August 1 to September 29, 2018. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Two reviewers independently screened the databases and extracted sample characteristics and outcomes scores. Pooled mean differences (MDs) were analyzed using random-effects models. Performance on standardized assessment of higher-order subskills of reading comprehension and applied mathematics problems; lower-order reading subskills of decoding, pseudoword decoding, and word identification; and lower-order mathematics subskills of knowledge, calculation, and fluency. Outcomes data were extracted for 4006 preterm and 3317 term-born children, totaling 7323 participants from 33 unique studies. Relative to children born at term, children born preterm scored significantly lower in reading comprehension (mean difference [MD], -7.96; 95% CI, -12.15 to -3.76; I2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°81%) and applied mathematical problems (MD, -11.41; 95% CI, -17.57 to -5.26; I2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°91%) assessments. Across the assessments of lower-order skills, children born preterm scored significantly lower than their term-born peers in calculation (MD, -10.57; 95% CI, -15.62 to -5.52; I2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°92%), decoding (MD, -10.18; 95% CI, -16.83 to -3.53; I2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°71%), mathematical knowledge (MD, -9.88; 95% CI, -11.68 to -8.08; I2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°62%), word identification (MD, -7.44; 95% CI, -9.08 to -5.80; I2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°69%), and mathematical fluency (MD, -6.89; 95% CI, -13.54 to -0.23; I2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°72%).

"Real-time Burn Classification using Ultrasound Imaging","This article presents a real-time approach for classification of burn depth based on B-mode ultrasound imaging. A grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) computed from the ultrasound images of the tissue is employed to construct the textural feature set and the classification is performed using nonlinear support vector machine and kernel Fisher discriminant analysis. A leave-one-out cross-validation is used for the independent assessment of the classifiers. The model is tested for pair-wise binary classification of four burn conditions in ex vivo porcine skin tissue: (i) 200Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â°F for 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°s, (ii) 200Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â°F for 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°s, (iii) 450Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â°F for 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°s, and (iv) 450Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â°F for 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°s. The average classification accuracy for pairwise separation is 99% with just over 30 samples in each burn group and the average multiclass classification accuracy is 93%. The results highlight that the ultrasound imaging-based burn classification approach in conjunction with the GLCM texture features provide an accurate assessment of altered tissue characteristics with relatively moderate sample sizes, which is often the case with experimental and clinical datasets. The proposed method is shown to have the potential to assist with the real-time clinical assessment of burn degrees, particularly for discriminating between superficial and deep second degree burns, which is challenging in clinical practice.","Lee, Rahul, Ye, Chittajallu, Kruger, Boyko, Lukan, Enquobahrie, Norfleet, De","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62674-9","20200903","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16987,""
"Prediction of admission in pediatric emergency department with deep neural networks and triage textual data","Emergency department (ED) overcrowding is a global condition that severely worsens attention to patients, increases clinical risks and affects hospital cost management. A correct and early prediction of ED's admission is of high value and a motivation to adopt machine learning models. However, several of these studies do not consider data collected in textual form, which is a feature set that contains detailed information about patients and presents great potential for medical health care improvement. To this end, we propose and compare predictive models for admission that use both structured and unstructured data available at triage time. In total, our dataset comprised 499,853 pediatric ED's presentations (with an admission rate of 5.76%) of patients with age up to 18 years old observed over 3.5 years. Our best model consists of a 2-stage architecture with a deep neural network (DNN) to extract information from textual data followed by a gradient boosting classifier. This combined model achieved a value of 0.892 for the Area Under the Curve (AUC) in the test data. We highlight the importance of DNN-based text processing for better prediction, since the absence of text features resulted in AUC reduction of approximately two percentage points. Also, the feature importance of text was higher than that of the Manchester Triage System (MTS), which is a widely used risk classification protocol. These results suggest that activations from a trained DNN should be used in transfer learning setups in future studies.","Roquette, Nagano, Marujo, Maiorano","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2020.03.012","20200921","Deep neural networks; Emergency department admission; Gradient boosting; Prediction model; Triage; Unstructured data; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Deep Learning; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Forecasting; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Male; Neural Networks, Computer; Patient Admission; Pediatrics; Triage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16988,""

"High-level motor skills assessment for ambulant children with cerebral palsy: a systematic review and decision tree","To examine the psychometric evidence for high-level motor skills assessment tools for ambulant, school-aged children with cerebral palsy (CP). We searched five databases for population (children with CP aged 5-18y in Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I and II), assessment focus (high-level motor skills), and psychometric evidence. We evaluated evidence strength using the number of studies, quality, and conduct according to COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments checklists. Eleven assessments (39 studies) met the criteria. Seven high-level motor skills assessment items (Muscle Power Sprint Test, 10m Shuttle Run Test, 10Ãƒâ€”5m Sprint Test, vertical jump, standing broad jump, seated throw, and Timed Up and Down Stairs) had strong validity and responsiveness evidence. Jumping items and seated throw lacked reliability data. Four high-level motor skills assessment batteries (Functional Strength Measure in CP, Gross Motor Function Measure-Challenge, Peabody Developmental Motor Scale, and Test of Gross Motor Development, Second Edition) had moderate-to-strong validity and/or reliability evidence. Responsiveness data were only available for the Gross Motor Function Measure-Challenge battery. The decision tree was developed with five levels: clinical feasibility, relevance, tool design, clinical utility, and psychometric properties. High-level motor skills assessment tools have strong psychometric evidence for ambulant, school-aged children with CP. The decision tree can assist clinicians and researchers in identifying appropriate tools to measure high-level motor skills. An evidence-based decision tree guides the selection of appropriate high-level motor skills assessment tools. Seven high-level motor skills assessment items have strong psychometric evidence and clinical utility for ambulant children with cerebral palsy.

"Multi-view radiomics and dosiomics analysis with machine learning for predicting acute-phase weight loss in lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy","We propose a multi-view data analysis approach using radiomics and dosiomics (R&amp;D) texture features for predicting acute-phase weight loss (WL) in lung cancer radiotherapy. Baseline weight of 388 patients who underwent intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was measured between one month prior to and one week after the start of IMRT. Weight change between one week and two months after the commencement of IMRT was analyzed, and dichotomized at 5% WL. Each patient had a planning CT and contours of gross tumor volume (GTV) and esophagus (ESO). A total of 355 features including clinical parameter (CP), GTV and ESO (GTV&amp;ESO) dose-volume histogram (DVH), GTV radiomics, and GTV&amp;ESO dosiomics features were extracted. R&amp;D features were categorized as first- (L1), second- (L2), higher-order (L3) statistics, and three combined groups, L1 + L2, L2 + L3 and L1 + L2 + L3. Multi-view texture analysis was performed to identify optimal R&amp;D input features. In the training set (194 earlier patients), feature selection was performed using Boruta algorithm followed by collinearity removal based on variance inflation factor. Machine-learning models were developed using Laplacian kernel support vector machine (lpSVM), deep neural network (DNN) and their averaged ensemble classifiers. Prediction performance was tested on an independent test set (194 more recent patients), and compared among seven different input conditions: CP-only, DVH-only, R&amp;D-only, DVH + CP, R&amp;D + CP, R&amp;D + DVH and R&amp;D + DVH + CP. Combined GTV L1 + L2 + L3 radiomics and GTV&amp;ESO L3 dosiomics were identified as optimal input features, which achieved the best performance with an ensemble classifier (AUC = 0.710), having statistically significantly higher predictability compared with DVH and/or CP features (p &lt; 0.05). When this performance was compared to that with full R&amp;D-only features which reflect traditional single-view data, there was a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.05). Using optimized multi-view R&amp;D input features is beneficial for predicting early WL in lung cancer radiotherapy, leading to improved performance compared to using conventional DVH and/or CP features.","Lee, Han, Hales, Voong, Noro, Sugiyama, Haller, McNutt, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab8531","20201009","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16991,""
"'Real time' monitoring of antipsychotic prescribing in patients with dementia: a study using the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) platform to enhance safer prescribing","The use of antipsychotic drugs in dementia has been reported to be associated with increased risk of cerebrovascular events and mortality. There is an international drive to reduce the use of these agents in patients with dementia and to improve the safety of prescribing and monitoring in this area. The aim of this project was to use enhanced automated regular feedback of information from electronic health records to improve the quality of antipsychotic prescribing and monitoring in people with dementia. The South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) incorporated antipsychotic monitoring forms into its electronic health records. The SLaM Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) platform provides researcher access to de-identified health records, and natural language processing is used in CRIS to derive structured data from unstructured free text, including recorded diagnoses and medication. Algorithms were thus developed to ascertain patients with dementia receiving antipsychotic treatment and to determine whether monitoring forms had been completed. We used two improvement plan-do-study-act cycles to improve the accuracy of the algorithm for automated evaluation and provided monthly feedback on team performance. A steady increase in antipsychotic monitoring form completion was observed across the study period. The percentage of our sample with a completed antipsychotic monitoring form more than doubled from October 2017 (22%) to January 2019 (58%). 'Real time' monitoring and regular feedback to teams offer a time-effective approach, complementary to standard audit methods, to enhance the safer prescribing of high risk drugs.","Colling, Mueller, Perera, Funnell, Sauer, Harwood, Stewart, Bishara","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2019-000778","20200807","checklists; clinical audit; continuous quality improvement; dementia; electronic health records","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16992,""
"Clinical Text Data in Machine Learning: Systematic Review","Clinical narratives represent the main form of communication within health care, providing a personalized account of patient history and assessments, and offering rich information for clinical decision making. Natural language processing (NLP) has repeatedly demonstrated its feasibility to unlock evidence buried in clinical narratives. Machine learning can facilitate rapid development of NLP tools by leveraging large amounts of text data. The main aim of this study was to provide systematic evidence on the properties of text data used to train machine learning approaches to clinical NLP. We also investigated the types of NLP tasks that have been supported by machine learning and how they can be applied in clinical practice. Our methodology was based on the guidelines for performing systematic reviews. In August 2018, we used PubMed, a multifaceted interface, to perform a literature search against MEDLINE. We identified 110 relevant studies and extracted information about text data used to support machine learning, NLP tasks supported, and their clinical applications. The data properties considered included their size, provenance, collection methods, annotation, and any relevant statistics. The majority of datasets used to train machine learning models included only hundreds or thousands of documents. Only 10 studies used tens of thousands of documents, with a handful of studies utilizing more. Relatively small datasets were utilized for training even when much larger datasets were available. The main reason for such poor data utilization is the annotation bottleneck faced by supervised machine learning algorithms. Active learning was explored to iteratively sample a subset of data for manual annotation as a strategy for minimizing the annotation effort while maximizing the predictive performance of the model. Supervised learning was successfully used where clinical codes integrated with free-text notes into electronic health records were utilized as class labels. Similarly, distant supervision was used to utilize an existing knowledge base to automatically annotate raw text. Where manual annotation was unavoidable, crowdsourcing was explored, but it remains unsuitable because of the sensitive nature of data considered. Besides the small volume, training data were typically sourced from a small number of institutions, thus offering no hard evidence about the transferability of machine learning models. The majority of studies focused on text classification. Most commonly, the classification results were used to support phenotyping, prognosis, care improvement, resource management, and surveillance. We identified the data annotation bottleneck as one of the key obstacles to machine learning approaches in clinical NLP. Active learning and distant supervision were explored as a way of saving the annotation efforts. Future research in this field would benefit from alternatives such as data augmentation and transfer learning, or unsupervised learning, which do not require data annotation.","Spasic, Nenadic","https://doi.org/10.2196/17984","20200928","machine learning; medical informatics; medical informatics applications; natural language processing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16993,""
"Handsearching had best recall but poor efficiency when exporting to a bibliographic tool: case study","The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of methods used to identify and export conference abstracts into a bibliographic management tool. This is a case study. The effectiveness and efficiency of methods to identify and export conference abstracts presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference 2016-2018 for a systematic review were evaluated. A reference standard handsearch of conference proceedings was compared with: 1) contacting Blood (the journal that report ASH proceedings); 2) keyword searching; 3) searching Embase; 4) searching MEDLINE via EndNote; and 5) searching CPCI-S. Effectiveness was determined by the number of abstracts identified compared with the reference standard, whereas efficiency was a comparison between the resources required to identify and export conference abstracts compared with the reference standard. Six hundred and four potentially eligible and 15 confirmed eligible conference abstracts (abstracts included in the review) were identified by the handsearch. Comparator 2 was the only method to identify all abstracts and it was more efficient than the reference standard. Comparators 1 and 3-5 missed a number of eligible abstracts. This study raises potentially concerning questions about searching for conferences' abstracts by methods other than directly searching the original conference proceedings. Efficiency of exporting would be improved if journals permitted bulk downloads.","Cooper, Snowsill, Worsley, Prowse, O'Mara-Eves, Greenwood, Boulton, Strickson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.03.013","20200615","Conference searching; Embase; Endnote; Handsearching; Information retrieval; Systematic reviews","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16994,""
"Energy enhanced tissue texture in spectral computed tomography for lesion classification","Tissue texture reflects the spatial distribution of contrasts of image voxel gray levels, i.e., the tissue heterogeneity, and has been recognized as important biomarkers in various clinical tasks. Spectral computed tomography (CT) is believed to be able to enrich tissue texture by providing different voxel contrast images using different X-ray energies. Therefore, this paper aims to address two related issues for clinical usage of spectral CT, especially the photon counting CT (PCCT): (1) texture enhancement by spectral CT image reconstruction, and (2) spectral energy enriched tissue texture for improved lesion classification. For issue (1), we recently proposed a tissue-specific texture prior in addition to low rank prior for the individual energy-channel low-count image reconstruction problems in PCCT under the Bayesian theory. Reconstruction results showed the proposed method outperforms existing methods of total variation (TV), low-rank TV and tensor dictionary learning in terms of not only preserving texture features but also suppressing image noise. For issue (2), this paper will investigate three models to incorporate the enriched texture by PCCT in accordance with three types of inputs: one is the spectral images, another is the co-occurrence matrices (CMs) extracted from the spectral images, and the third one is the Haralick features (HF) extracted from the CMs. Studies were performed on simulated photon counting data by introducing attenuation-energy response curve to the traditional CT images from energy integration detectors. Classification results showed the spectral CT enriched texture model can improve the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score by 7.3%, 0.42% and 3.0% for the spectral images, CMs and HFs respectively on the five-energy spectral data over the original single energy data only. The CM- and HF-inputs can achieve the best AUC of 0.934 and 0.927. This texture themed study shows the insight that incorporating clinical important prior information, e.g., tissue texture in this paper, into the medical imaging, such as the upstream image reconstruction, the downstream diagnosis, and so on, can benefit the clinical tasks.","Gao, Shi, Cao, Zhang, Liang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s42492-019-0028-3","20200928","Bayesian reconstruction; Lesion classification; Machine learning; Spectral computed tomography; Tissue texture","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16995,""
"Use of Artificial Intelligence for Medical Literature Search: Randomized Controlled Trial Using the Hackathon Format","Mapping out the research landscape around a project is often time consuming and difficult. This study evaluates a commercial artificial intelligence (AI) search engine (IRIS.AI) for its applicability in an automated literature search on a specific medical topic. To evaluate the AI search engine in a standardized manner, the concept of a science hackathon was applied. Three groups of researchers were tasked with performing a literature search on a clearly defined scientific project. All participants had a high level of expertise for this specific field of research. Two groups were given access to the AI search engine IRIS.AI. All groups were given the same amount of time for their search and were instructed to document their results. Search results were summarized and ranked according to a predetermined scoring system. The final scoring awarded 49 and 39 points out of 60 to AI groups 1 and 2, respectively, and the control group received 46 points. A total of 20 scientific studies with high relevance were identified, and 5 highly relevant studies (&quot;spot on&quot;) were reported by each group. AI technology is a promising approach to facilitate literature searches and the management of medical libraries. In this study, however, the application of AI technology lead to a more focused literature search without a significant improvement in the number of results.","Schoeb, Suarez-Ibarrola, Hein, Dressler, Adams, Schlager, Miernik","https://doi.org/10.2196/16606","20200928","artificial intelligence; literature review; medical information technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16996,""
"[Improved patient safety through a clinical decision support system in laboratory medicine]","Laboratory diagnostics are essential for diagnosis, initiation of therapy, and monitoring of patients. Laboratory results that are overlooked or incorrectly interpreted lead to adverse events and endanger patient safety. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) may facilitate appropriate interpretation of results and subsequent medical response. The research project on digital laboratory medicine (AMPEL) aims at developing aÃ‚Â CDSS based on laboratory diagnostics, which supports practitioners in ensuring the necessary medical consequences. AÃ‚Â literature review of CDSSs describes the current state of research. The research project AMPEL is presented with its objectives, challenges, and first results. Furthermore, the development of aÃ‚Â framework and reporting system is illustrated through the clinical example of severe hypokalemia. Through interdisciplinary development and constant optimization, aÃ‚Â specific CDSS with high acceptance among clinicians was developed. Initial results in the case of severe hypokalemia show aÃ‚Â positive effect on patient care. Thereby, more complex frameworks such as sepsis diagnostics or acute coronary syndrome are implemented. The limited availability of standardized and digital clinical data is challenging.

"The Impacts of Orthognathic Surgery on the Facial Appearance and Age Perception of Patients Presenting Skeletal Class III Deformity: An Outcome Study Using the FACE-Q Report and Surgical Professional-Based Panel Assessment","A recent artificial intelligence-based investigation has shown the impacts of orthognathic surgery on the patient's facial appearance and apparent age. However, appearance and age perception as reported by patients and surgical professionals have not been addressed in the same cohort to date. FACE-Q facial appraisal (appearance and age) and quality-of-life scale scores obtained before and after orthognathic surgery, in addition to three-dimensional photographs of 70 patients with skeletal class III deformity, were collected for a comparative cross-sectional study. Seven blinded plastic surgeons rated all photographs for apparent facial aesthetic and age scales. The FACE-Q data from 57 matched normal individuals were adopted for the comparative analyses. The correlation between the FACE-Q and the professional-based scales was tested. Pre-orthognathic surgery versus post-orthognathic surgery comparisons showed significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) for all FACE-Q scales and panel assessments, with higher (FACE-Q scales and professional-based aesthetic parameters) and lower (FACE-Q patient-perceived age scale and professional-based age parameter) values for post-orthognathic surgery measurements. Patients had significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher (patient-perceived age scale) and lower (facial appraisal and quality-of-life scales) FACE-Q values than normal individuals for pre-orthognathic surgery but not for post-orthognathic surgery measurements. The FACE-Q facial appearance overall scale had significant correlations (p &lt; 0.001) with the panel assessment for the parameters &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;attractive&quot; but not for the &quot;pleasant&quot; parameter. No significant correlations were observed for facial age scales. This study contributes to the orthognathic surgery literature by revealing that orthognathic surgery positively impacts the perception of apparent facial age and improves facial appearance and quality of life.

"Hold the Salt: History of Salt Restriction as a First-line Therapy for MeniÃƒÂ¨re's Disease","To determine the historical origins of the usage of the salt restriction diet as an intervention for MeniÃƒÂ¨re's disease (MD). Articles on MD and salt restriction were identified using Pubmed and Google scholar. Original manuscripts from 19th and 20th century as well as selected otological textbooks in English, German, and French were also reviewed. The oldest recommendation of salt restriction in the literature was by Dederding (1889-1955) in 1929. She and her mentor, Sydney Holger Mygind (1884-1970), believed MD was caused by dysfunctional water metabolism. In several published manuscripts, they proposed that a reduced salt and fluid diet was an effective treatment for MD. Their contemporaries supported their findings, most notably, Albert C. Furstenberg (1890-1969) who suggested salt restriction alone as treatment for MD. Furstenberg, in his initial study implementing salt restriction in 15 patients with MD and then in a larger study with 150 patients, was the first to produce results that supported salt restriction as therapy for MD. It was not until 1980, when LB Jongkees first published his criticism of this treatment, that salt restriction was questioned. Since then, numerous published articles have been critical of salt restriction therapy and skeptical of its initial adoption into clinical practice. Since Dederding's and Mygind's publications in 1929 and Furstenberg's trial in 1934, the salt restriction diet has remained a primary first-line treatment for MD. Since the 1950s, various publications have both supported and argued this treatment, and the evidence of its validity remains inconclusive.","Shim, Strum, Mudry, Monfared","https://doi.org/10.1097/MAO.0000000000002635","20200623","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",16999,""
"Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Frailty Assessment in Older Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery","In perioperative settings, frailty assessment has been shown to reduce mortality. This study examined the cost effectiveness of frailty assessment among patients aged 65 with coronary artery disease under consideration for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. A combined decision tree and Markov model was developed to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 21-year time horizon. Clinical parameters were obtained from published literature. Utilities were derived from the literature and the Canadian Community Health Survey. Costs were obtained from the Ontario fee schedule and published literature. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) analysis was conducted to estimate the value of further research. The frailty assessment initiative had a lower average cost than no frailty assessment ($19,567 compared with $20,062). QALYs with frailty assessment were 0.47 years more than with no frailty assessment. Thus, frailty assessment was dominant compared with no frailty assessment. Results were robust to changes in the input parameters. At a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000/QALY, there was 100% probability of frailty assessment being cost-effective, and the EVPI per patient was $0. Scenario and sensitivity analysis showed frailty screening remained cost effective when changing the cohort average age, removing health benefits for nonfrail patients, and using subjective judgement to modify effectiveness parameters. Frailty assessment may be good value for money. However, limited availability of geriatric consultation services, may hinder implementation. Thus, the estimated benefits of frailty screening may not be achievable in practice.","Li, Habbous, Thain, Hall, Nagpal, Bagur, Kiaii, John-Baptiste","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2019.09.025","20201022","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Coronary Artery Bypass; Coronary Artery Disease; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Trees; Frailty; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Markov Chains; Perioperative Care; Quality-Adjusted Life Years","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17000,""
"Technical and imaging factors influencing performance of deep learning systems for diabetic retinopathy","Deep learning (DL) has been shown to be effective in developing diabetic retinopathy (DR) algorithms, possibly tackling financial and manpower challenges hindering implementation of DR screening. However, our systematic review of the literature reveals few studies studied the impact of different factors on these DL algorithms, that are important for clinical deployment in real-world settings. Using 455,491 retinal images, we evaluated two technical and three image-related factors in detection of referable DR. For technical factors, the performances of four DL models (VGGNet, ResNet, DenseNet, Ensemble) and two computational frameworks (Caffe, TensorFlow) were evaluated while for image-related factors, we evaluated image compression levels (reducing image size, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150Ã¢â‚¬â€°KB), number of fields (7-field, 2-field, 1-field) and media clarity (pseudophakic vs phakic). In detection of referable DR, four DL models showed comparable diagnostic performance (AUC 0.936-0.944). To develop the VGGNet model, two computational frameworks had similar AUC (0.936). The DL performance dropped when image size decreased below 250Ã¢â‚¬â€°KB (AUC 0.936, 0.900, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The DL performance performed better when there were increased number of fields (dataset 1: 2-field vs 1-field-AUC 0.936 vs 0.908, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; dataset 2: 7-field vs 2-field vs 1-field, AUC 0.949 vs 0.911 vs 0.895). DL performed better in the pseudophakic than phakic eyes (AUC 0.918 vs 0.833, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Various image-related factors play more significant roles than technical factors in determining the diagnostic performance, suggesting the importance of having robust training and testing datasets for DL training and deployment in the real-world settings.","Yip, Lim, Lim, Nguyen, Chong, Yu, Bellemo, Xie, Lee, Hamzah, Ho, Tan, Sabanayagam, Grzybowski, Tan, Hsu, Lee, Wong, Ting","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-020-0247-1","20200928","Population screening; Translational research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17001,""
"Machine learning for microbial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing on MALDI-TOF mass spectra: a systematic review","The matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technology has revolutionized the field of microbiology by facilitating precise and rapid species identification. Recently, machine learning techniques have been leveraged to maximally exploit the information contained in MALDI-TOF MS, with the ultimate goal to refine species identification and streamline antimicrobial resistance determination. The aim was to systematically review and evaluate studies employing machine learning for the analysis of MALDI-TOF mass spectra. Using PubMed/Medline, Scopus and Web of Science, we searched the existing literature for machine learning-supported applications of MALDI-TOF mass spectra for microbial species and antimicrobial susceptibility identification. Original research studies using machine learning to exploit MALDI-TOF mass spectra for microbial specie and antimicrobial susceptibility identification were included. Studies focusing on single proteins and peptides, case studies and review articles were excluded. A systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines was performed and a quality assessment of the machine learning models conducted. From the 36 studies that met our inclusion criteria, 27 employed machine learning for species identification and nine for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Support Vector Machines, Genetic Algorithms, Artificial Neural Networks and Quick Classifiers were the most frequently used machine learning algorithms. The quality of the studies ranged between poor and very good. The majority of the studies reported how to interpret the predictors (88.89%) and suggested possible clinical applications of the developed algorithm (100%), but only four studies (11.11%) validated machine learning algorithms on external datasets. A growing number of studies utilize machine learning to optimize the analysis of MALDI-TOF mass spectra. This review, however, demonstrates that there are certain shortcomings of current machine learning-supported approaches that have to be addressed to make them widely available and incorporated them in the clinical routine.","Weis, Jutzeler, Borgwardt","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.014","20200921","Antimicrobial resistance; Antimicrobial susceptibility testing; Antimicrobial treatment; MALDI-TOF MS; Machine learning; Microbial identification","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17002,""
"Radiomic Features of Primary Rectal Cancers on Baseline T<sub>2</sub> -Weighted MRI Are Associated With Pathologic Complete Response to Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation: A Multisite Study","Twenty-five percent of rectal adenocarcinoma patients achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemoradiation and could avoid proctectomy. However, pretreatment clinical or imaging markers are lacking in predicting response to chemoradiation. Radiomic texture features from MRI have recently been associated with therapeutic response in other cancers. To construct a radiomics texture model based on pretreatment MRI for identifying patients who will achieve pCR to neoadjuvant chemoradiation in rectal cancer, including validation across multiple scanners and sites. Retrospective. In all, 104 rectal cancer patients staged with MRI prior to long-course chemoradiation followed by proctectomy; curated from three institutions. 1.5T-3.0T, axial higher resolution T<sub>2</sub> -weighted turbo spin echo sequence. Pathologic response was graded on postsurgical specimens. In total, 764 radiomic features were extracted from single-slice sections of rectal tumors on processed pretreatment T<sub>2</sub> -weighted MRI. Three feature selection schemes were compared for identifying radiomic texture descriptors associated with pCR via a discovery cohort (one site, N = 60, cross-validation). The top-selected radiomic texture features were used to train and validate a random forest classifier model for pretreatment identification of pCR (two external sites, N = 44). Model performance was evaluated via area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Laws kernel responses and gradient organization features were most associated with pCR (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01); as well as being commonly identified across all feature selection schemes. The radiomics model yielded a discovery AUC of 0.699Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.076 and a hold-out validation AUC of 0.712 with 70.5% accuracy (70.0% sensitivity, 70.6% specificity) in identifying pCR. Radiomic texture features were resilient to variations in magnetic field strength as well as being consistent between two different expert annotations. Univariate analysis revealed no significant associations of baseline clinicopathologic or MRI findings with pCR (P = 0.07-0.96). Radiomic texture features from pretreatment MRIs may enable early identification of potential pCR to neoadjuvant chemoradiation, as well as generalize across sites. 3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 2.","Antunes, Ofshteyn, Bera, Wang, Brady, Willis, Friedman, Marderstein, Kalady, Stein, Purysko, Paspulati, Gollamudi, Madabhushi, Viswanath","https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.27140","20201004","machine learning; pathologic complete response; radiomics; rectal cancer","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17003,""
"Dosimetric evaluation of synthetic CT generated with GANs for MRI-only proton therapy treatment planning of brain tumors","The purpose of this study was to address the dosimetric accuracy of synthetic computed tomography (sCT) images of patients with brain tumor generated using a modified generative adversarial network (GAN) method, for their use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-only treatment planning for proton therapy. Dose volume histogram (DVH) analysis was performed on CT and sCT images of patients with brain tumor for plans generated for intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). All plans were robustly optimized using a commercially available treatment planning system (RayStation, from RaySearch Laboratories) and standard robust parameters reported in the literature. The IMPT plan was then used to compute the dose on CT and sCT images for dosimetric comparison, using RayStation analytical (pencil beam) dose algorithm. We used a second, independent Monte Carlo dose calculation engine to recompute the dose on both CT and sCT images to ensure a proper analysis of the dosimetric accuracy of the sCT images. The results extracted from RayStation showed excellent agreement for most DVH metrics computed on the CT and sCT for the nominal case, with a mean absolute difference below 0.5% (0.3Ã‚Â Gy) of the prescription dose for the clinical target volume (CTV) and below 2% (1.2Ã‚Â Gy) for the organs at risk (OARs) considered. This demonstrates a high dosimetric accuracy for the generated sCT images, especially in the target volume. The metrics obtained from the Monte Carlo doses mostly agreed with the values extracted from RayStation for the nominal and worst-case scenarios (mean difference below 3%). This work demonstrated the feasibility of using sCT generated with a GAN-based deep learning method for MRI-only treatment planning of patients with brain tumor in intensity-modulated proton therapy.","Kazemifar, BarragÃƒÂ¡n Montero, Souris, Rivas, Timmerman, Park, Jiang, Geets, Sterpin, Owrangi","https://doi.org/10.1002/acm2.12856","20200612","GAN structure; artificial intelligence; brain MRI; deep learning; proton therapy; synthetic CT","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17004,""

"Heart rate variability as a measure of mental stress in surgery: a systematic review","There is increasing interest in the use of heart rate variability (HRV) as an objective measurement of mental stress in the surgical setting. To identify areas of improvement, the aim of our study was to review current use of HRV measurements in the surgical setting, evaluate the different methods used for the analysis of HRV, and to assess whether HRV is being measured correctly. A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). 17 studies regarding HRV as a measurement of mental stress in the surgical setting were included and analysed. 24% of the studies performed long-term measurements (24Ã‚Â h and longer) to assess the long-term effects of and recovery from mental stress. In 24% of the studies, artefact correction took place. HRV showed to be a good objective assessment method of stress induced in the workplace environment: it was able to pinpoint stressors during operations, determine which operating techniques induced most stress for surgeons, and indicate differences in stress levels between performing and assisting surgery. For future research, this review recommends using singular guidelines to standardize research, and performing artefact correction. This will improve further evaluation of the long-term effects of mental stress and its recovery.","The, Reijmerink, van der Laan, Cnossen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-020-01525-6","20200903","Heart rate variability; Mental stress; Occupational stress; Surgery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17006,""
"Artificial intelligence versus clinicians: systematic review of design, reporting standards, and claims of deep learning studies","To systematically examine the design, reporting standards, risk of bias, and claims of studies comparing the performance of diagnostic deep learning algorithms for medical imaging with that of expert clinicians. Systematic review. Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization trial registry from 2010 to June 2019. Randomised trial registrations and non-randomised studies comparing the performance of a deep learning algorithm in medical imaging with a contemporary group of one or more expert clinicians. Medical imaging has seen a growing interest in deep learning research. The main distinguishing feature of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in deep learning is that when CNNs are fed with raw data, they develop their own representations needed for pattern recognition. The algorithm learns for itself the features of an image that are important for classification rather than being told by humans which features to use. The selected studies aimed to use medical imaging for predicting absolute risk of existing disease or classification into diagnostic groups (eg, disease or non-disease). For example, raw chest radiographs tagged with a label such as pneumothorax or no pneumothorax and the CNN learning which pixel patterns suggest pneumothorax. Adherence to reporting standards was assessed by using CONSORT (consolidated standards of reporting trials) for randomised studies and TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) for non-randomised studies. Risk of bias was assessed by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised studies and PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool) for non-randomised studies. Only 10 records were found for deep learning randomised clinical trials, two of which have been published (with low risk of bias, except for lack of blinding, and high adherence to reporting standards) and eight are ongoing. Of 81 non-randomised clinical trials identified, only nine were prospective and just six were tested in a real world clinical setting. The median number of experts in the comparator group was only four (interquartile range 2-9). Full access to all datasets and code was severely limited (unavailable in 95% and 93% of studies, respectively). The overall risk of bias was high in 58 of 81 studies and adherence to reporting standards was suboptimal (&lt;50% adherence for 12 of 29 TRIPOD items). 61 of 81 studies stated in their abstract that performance of artificial intelligence was at least comparable to (or better than) that of clinicians. Only 31 of 81 studies (38%) stated that further prospective studies or trials were required. Few prospective deep learning studies and randomised trials exist in medical imaging. Most non-randomised trials are not prospective, are at high risk of bias, and deviate from existing reporting standards. Data and code availability are lacking in most studies, and human comparator groups are often small. Future studies should diminish risk of bias, enhance real world clinical relevance, improve reporting and transparency, and appropriately temper conclusions.

"Image analysis and artificial intelligence in infectious disease diagnostics","Microbiologists are valued for their time-honed skills in image analysis, including identification of pathogens and inflammatory context in Gram stains, ova and parasite preparations, blood smears and histopathologic slides. They also must classify colony growth on a variety of agar plates for triage and assessment. Recent advances in image analysis, in particular application of artificial intelligence (AI), have the potential to automate these processes and support more timely and accurate diagnoses. To review current AI-based image analysis as applied to clinical microbiology; and to discuss future trends in the field. Material sourced for this review included peer-reviewed literature annotated in the PubMed or Google Scholar databases and preprint articles from bioRxiv. Articles describing use of AI for analysis of images used in infectious disease diagnostics were reviewed. We describe application of machine learning towards analysis of different types of microbiologic image data. Specifically, we outline progress in smear and plate interpretation as well as the potential for AI diagnostic applications in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Combined with automation, we predict that AI algorithms will be used in the future to prescreen and preclassify image data, thereby increasing productivity and enabling more accurate diagnoses through collaboration between the AI and the microbiologist. Once developed, image-based AI analysis is inexpensive and amenable to local and remote diagnostic use.","Smith, Kirby","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.012","20200925","Artificiall intelligence; Deep learning; Gram stain; Machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17008,""
"Deep Learning-Based Method of Diagnosing Hyperlipidemia and Providing Diagnostic Markers Automatically","The research of auxiliary diagnosis has always been one of the hotspots in the world. The implementation of auxiliary diagnosis support algorithm for medical text data faces challenges with interpretability and creditability. The improvement of clinical diagnostic techniques means not only the improvement of diagnostic accuracy but also the further study of diagnostic basis. Traditional research methods for diagnostic markers often require a large amount of time and economic costs. Research objects are often dozens of samples, and it is, therefore, difficult to synthesize large amounts of data. Therefore, the comprehensiveness and reliability of traditional methods have yet to be improved. Therefore, the establishment of a model that can automatically diagnose diseases and automatically provide a diagnostic basis at the same time has a positive effect on the improvement of medical diagnostic techniques. Here, we established an auxiliary diagnostic tool based on attention deep learning algorithm to diagnostic hyperlipemia and automatically predict the corresponding diagnostic markers using hematological parameters. In this paper, we not only demonstrated the ability of the proposed model to automatically diagnose diseases using text-based medical data, such as physiological parameters, but also demonstrated its ability to forecast disease diagnostic markers. Human physiological parameters are used as input to the model, and the doctor's diagnosis results as an output. Through the attention layer, the degree of attention of the model to different physiological parameters can be obtained, that is, the model provides a diagnostic basis. It achieved 94% ACC, 97.48% AUC, 96% sensitivity and 92% specificity with the test dataset. All the above samples are drawn from clinical practice. Moreover, the model predicted the diagnostic markers of hyperlipidemia by the attention mechanism, and the results were fully agreeable to the golden criteria. The auxiliary diagnosis system proposed in this paper not only achieves the accurate and robust performance, and can be used for the preliminary diagnosis of patients, but also showing its great potential to discover new diagnostic markers. Therefore, it not only can improve the efficiency of clinical diagnosis but also shorten the research period of researching a diagnosis basis to an extent. It has a positive significance to the development of the medical diagnosis level.","Liu, Zhang, Zhao, Liu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.2147/DMSO.S242585","20200928","artificial intelligence; attention mechanism; automatic diagnosis; automatic predictive diagnostic markers; hyperlipemia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17009,""
"Overcoming Alzheimer's Disease Stigma by Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain Technologies","Alzheimer's disease (AD) imposes a considerable burden on those diagnosed. Faced with a neurodegenerative decline for which there is no effective cure or prevention method, sufferers of the disease are subject to judgement, both self-imposed and otherwise, that can have a great deal of effect on their lives. The burden of this stigma is more than just psychological, as reluctance to face an AD diagnosis can lead people to avoid early diagnosis, treatment, and research opportunities that may be beneficial to them, and that may help progress towards fighting AD and its progression. In this review, we discuss how recent advents in information technology may be employed to help fight this stigma. Using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, specifically natural language processing (NLP), to classify the sentiment and tone of texts, such as those of online posts on various social media sites, has proven to be an effective tool for assessing the opinions of the general public on certain topics. These tools can be used to analyze the public stigma surrounding AD. Additionally, there is much concern among individuals that an AD diagnosis, or evidence of pre-clinical AD such as a biomarker or imaging test results, may wind up unintentionally disclosed to an entity that may discriminate against them. The lackluster security record of many medical institutions justifies this fear to an extent. Adopting more secure and decentralized methods of data transfer and storage, and giving patients enhanced ability to control their own data, such as a blockchain-based method, may help to alleviate some of these fears.","Pilozzi, Huang","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci10030183","20200928","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; artificial intelligence; blockchain; natural language processing; sentiment analysis; social media; stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17010,""

"An update on the management of breast atypical ductal hyperplasia","Among lesions with uncertain malignant potential found at percutaneous breast biopsy, atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) carries both the highest risk of underestimation and the closest and most pathologist-dependent differential diagnosis with ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> (DCIS), matching the latter's features save for size only. ADH is therefore routinely surgically excised, but single-centre studies with limited sample size found low rates of upgrade to invasive cancer or DCIS. This suggests the possibility of surveillance over surgery in selected subgroups, considering the 2% threshold allowing for follow-up according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. A recent meta-analysis on 6458 lesions counters this approach, confirming that, surgically excised or managed with surveillance, ADH carries a 29% and 5% upgrade rate, respectively, invariably higher than 2% even in subgroups considering biopsy guidance and technique, needle calibre, apparent complete lesion removal. The high heterogeneity (<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 80%) found in this meta-analysis reaffirmed the need to synthesise evidence from systematic reviews to achieve generalisable results, fit for guidelines development. Limited tissue sampling at percutaneous biopsy intrinsically hampers the prediction of ADH-associated malignancy. This prediction could be improved by using contrast-enhanced breast imaging and applying artificial intelligence on both pathology and imaging results, allowing for overtreatment reduction.","Schiaffino, Cozzi, Sardanelli","https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20200117","20200604","Artificial Intelligence; Biopsy; Biopsy, Fine-Needle; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Calcinosis; Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating; Consensus Development Conferences as Topic; Female; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Watchful Waiting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17012,""
"The CARESSES study protocol: testing and evaluating culturally competent socially assistive robots among older adults residing in long term care homes through a controlled experimental trial","This article describes the design of an intervention study that focuses on whether and to what degree culturally competent social robots can improve health and well-being related outcomes among older adults residing long-term care homes. The trial forms the final stage of the international, multidisciplinary CARESSES project aimed at designing, developing and evaluating culturally competent robots that can assist older people according to the culture of the individual they are supporting. The importance of cultural competence has been demonstrated in previous nursing literature to be key towards improving health outcomes among patients. This study employed a mixed-method, single-blind, parallel-group controlled before-and-after experimental trial design that took place in England and Japan. It aimed to recruit 45 residents of long-term care homes aged Ã¢â€°Â¥65Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, possess sufficient cognitive and physical health and who self-identify with the English, Indian or Japanese culture (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°15 each). Participants were allocated to either the experimental group, control group 1 or control group 2 (all nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15). Those allocated to the experimental group or control group 1 received a Pepper robot programmed with the CARESSES culturally competent artificial intelligence (experimental group) or a limited version of this software (control group 1) for 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°h across 2 weeks. Participants in control group 2 did not receive a robot and continued to receive care as usual. Participants could also nominate their informal carer(s) to participate. Quantitative data collection occurred at baseline, after 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°week of use, and after 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks of use with the latter time-point also including qualitative semi-structured interviews that explored their experience and perceptions further. Quantitative outcomes of interest included perceptions of robotic cultural competence, health-related quality of life, loneliness, user satisfaction, attitudes towards robots and caregiver burden. This trial adds to the current preliminary and limited pool of evidence regarding the benefits of socially assistive robots for older adults which to date indicates considerable potential for improving outcomes. It is the first to assess whether and to what extent cultural competence carries importance in generating improvements to well-being.

"Future use of musculoskeletal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging in rheumatoid arthritis","Musculoskeletal ultrasonography (MSUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play important roles in diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication of rheumatoid arthritis. This review highlights recent literature in this field and aims to provide insight into the future use in clinical practice. Recent studies concerning the use of MSUS and MRI in clinical practice show how MSUS and MRI can improve diagnosis and monitoring of rheumatoid arthritis and how they can predict both radiographic progression and clinical outcome (e.g., successful tapering of medical treatment). Moreover, novel technical developments of the two imaging modalities, such as 3D ultrasonography, ultrasound image reading with convolutional neural network, image fusion (MSUS and MRI) and whole-body MRI show promising results. Further validation of these novel techniques is required prior to implementation. MSUS and MRI will be important parts of the future management of rheumatoid arthritis patients, mostly because of their ability to detect rheumatoid arthritis changes at a very early stage and to predict the course of disease. However, the exact role in routine clinical practice is still to be defined.","Carstensen, Terslev, Jensen, ÃƒËœstergaard","https://doi.org/10.1097/BOR.0000000000000709","20200904","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17014,""
"Reporting quality of studies using machine learning models for medical diagnosis: a systematic review","We conducted a systematic review assessing the reporting quality of studies validating models based on machine learning (ML) for clinical diagnosis, with a specific focus on the reporting of information concerning the participants on which the diagnostic task was evaluated on. Medline Core Clinical Journals were searched for studies published between July 2015 and July 2018. Two reviewers independently screened the retrieved articles, a third reviewer resolved any discrepancies. An extraction list was developed from the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis guideline. Two reviewers independently extracted the data from the eligible articles. Third and fourth reviewers checked, verified the extracted data as well as resolved any discrepancies between the reviewers. The search results yielded 161 papers, of which 28 conformed to the eligibility criteria. Detail of data source was reported in 24 of the 28 papers. For all of the papers, the set of patients on which the ML-based diagnostic system was evaluated was partitioned from a larger dataset, and the method for deriving such set was always reported. Information on the diagnostic/non-diagnostic classification was reported well (23/28). The least reported items were the use of reporting guideline (0/28), distribution of disease severity (8/28 patient flow diagram (10/28) and distribution of alternative diagnosis (10/28). A large proportion of studies (23/28) had a delay between the conduct of the reference standard and ML tests, while one study did not and four studies were unclear. For 15 studies, it was unclear whether the evaluation group corresponded to the setting in which the ML test will be applied to. All studies in this review failed to use reporting guidelines, and a large proportion of them lacked adequate detail on participants, making it difficult to replicate, assess and interpret study findings.

"Changes in corneal biomechanics in patients with diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis","To determine the changes in corneal biomechanical parameters in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) in comparison with controls. Pertinent studies were identified by comprehensively search of PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the Chinese biomedical disc (CBM) databases. Pooling analyses by random models using the D-L method were performed for corneal hysteresis (CH), the corneal resistance factor (CRF), corneal-compensated intraocular pressure (IOPcc) and Goldmann-correlated intraocular pressure (IOPg). A total of 15 studies were included in the final analysis, involving 1506 eyes in the diabetic group and 2190 eyes in the control group. The diabetic group had significantly higher CH, CRF, IOPg and IOPcc values than the control group. The pooled mean differences were 1.34Ã‚Â mmHg (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60-2.08Ã‚Â mmHg, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) for IOPg and 0.85Ã‚Â mmHg (95% CI 0.18-1.51Ã‚Â mmHg, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.013) for IOPcc, 0.38Ã‚Â mmHg (95% CI 0.01-0.75, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.047) for CH and 0.63Ã‚Â mmHg (95% CI 0.27-0.98, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) for the CRF.

"Speech exemplar and evaluation database (SEED) for clinical training in articulatory phonetics and speech science","One challenge faced by teachers of phonetics, speech science, and clinical speech disorders courses is providing meaningful instruction that closes the theory to practice gap. One barrier to providing this type of deep learning experience is the lack of publicly available examples of speech recordings that illustrate comparisons between typical and disordered speech production across a broad range of disorder populations. Data of this type exist, but are typically collected for specific research projects under narrowly written IRB protocols that do not allow for release of even de-identified speech recordings to other investigators or teachers. As a partial corrective to this problem, we have developed an approved publicly available database of speech recordings that provides illustrative examples of adult and child speech production from individuals with and without speech disorders. The recorded speech materials were designed to illustrate important clinical concepts, and the recordings were collected under controlled conditions using high-quality equipment. The ultimate goal of creating this corpus is to improve practitioners' and scientists' understanding of the scientific bases of knowledge in our profession and improve our ability to develop clinical scientists and young researchers in the field.","Speights Atkins, Bailey, Boyce","https://doi.org/10.1080/02699206.2020.1743761","20200803","Database; adult speech; child speech; speech disorders; speech production","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17017,""
"Efficacy of robot-assisted gait training in multiple sclerosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Multiple sclerosis is a progressive disease responsible for gait disabilities and cognitive impairment, which affect functional performance. Robot-assisted gait training is an emerging training method to facilitate body-weight-supported treadmill training in many neurologic diseases. Through this study, we aimed to determine the efficacy of robot-assisted gait training in patients with multiple sclerosis. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of robot-assisted gait training for multiple sclerosis. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov registry for articles published before May 2019. The primary outcome was walking performance (gait parameters, balance, and ambulation capability). The secondary outcomes were changes in perceived fatigue, severity of spasticity, global mobility, physical and mental quality of life, severity of pain, activities of daily living, and treatment acceptance. We identified 10 studies (9 different trials) that included patients with multiple sclerosis undergoing robot-assisted gait training or conventional walk training. The meta-analysis showed comparable effectiveness between robot-assisted gait training and conventional walking therapy in walking performance, quality of life, pain, or activities of daily living. The robot-assisted gait training was even statistically superior to conventional walking therapy in improving perceived fatigue (pooled SMD: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.02-0.67), spasticity (pooled SMD: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.08-1.33, IÃ‚Â²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 53%), and global mobility (borderline) after the intervention. Our results provide the most up-to-date evidence regarding the robot-assisted gait training on multiple sclerosis.

"Investigating Bullying as a Predictor of Suicidality in a Clinical Sample of Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder","For typically developing adolescents, being bullied is associated with increased risk of suicidality. Although adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at increased risk of both bullying and suicidality, there is very little research that examines the extent to which an experience of being bullied may increase suicidality within this specific population. To address this, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the longitudinal association between experiencing bullying and suicidality in a clinical population of 680 adolescents with ASD. Electronic health records of adolescents (13-17Ã¢â‚¬â€°years), using mental health services in South London, with a diagnosis of ASD were analyzed. Natural language processing was employed to identify mentions of bullying and suicidality in the free text fields of adolescents' clinical records. Cox regression analysis was employed to investigate the longitudinal relationship between bullying and suicidality outcomes. Reported experience of bullying in the first month of clinical contact was associated with an increased risk suicidality over the follow-up period (hazard ratio = 1.82; 95% confidence interval = 1.28-2.59). In addition, female gender, psychosis, affective disorder diagnoses, and higher intellectual ability were all associated with suicidality at follow-up. This study is the first to demonstrate the strength of longitudinal associations between bullying and suicidality in a clinical population of adolescents with ASD, using automated approaches to detect key life events within clinical records. Our findings provide support for identifying and dealing with bullying in schools, and for antibullying strategy's incorporation into wider suicide prevention programs for young people with ASD.

We examined the clinical records of adolescents (aged 13-18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old) with ASD in South London who were receiving treatment from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. We found that if they reported being bullied in the first month after they were first seen by mental health services, they were nearly twice as likely to go on to develop suicidal thoughts or behaviors.","Holden, Mueller, McGowan, Sanyal, Kikoler, Simonoff, Velupillai, Downs","https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2292","20200629","adolescents; clinical psychiatry; comorbid conditions; data-driven techniques; epidemiology; longitudinal data analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17019,""
"Network Mapping of Connectivity Alterations in Disorder of Consciousness: Towards Targeted Neuromodulation","Disorder of consciousness (DoC) refers to a group of clinical conditions that may emerge after brain injury, characterized by a varying decrease in the level of consciousness that can last from days to years. An understanding of its neural correlates is crucial for the conceptualization and application of effective therapeutic interventions. Here we propose a quantitative meta-analysis of the neural substrate of DoC emerging from functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies. We also map the relevant networks of resulting areas to highlight similarities with Resting State Networks (RSNs) and hypothesize potential therapeutic solutions leveraging network-targeted noninvasive brain stimulation. Available literature was reviewed and analyzed through the activation likelihood estimate (ALE) statistical framework to describe resting-state or task-dependent brain activation patterns in DoC patients. Results show that task-related activity is limited to temporal regions resembling the auditory cortex, whereas resting-state fMRI data reveal a diffuse decreased activation affecting two subgroups of cortical (angular gyrus, middle frontal gyrus) and subcortical (thalamus, cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus) regions. Clustering of their cortical functional connectivity projections identify two main altered functional networks, related to decreased activity of (i) the default mode and frontoparietal networks, as well as (ii) the anterior salience and visual/auditory networks. Based on the strength and topography of their connectivity profile, biophysical modeling of potential brain stimulation solutions suggests the first network as the most feasible target for tES, tDCS neuromodulation in DoC patients.","Mencarelli, Biagi, Salvador, Romanella, Ruffini, Rossi, Santarnecchi","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9030828","20200928","brain networks; brain stimulation; connectivity; default mode network; disorder of consciousness; fMRI; network mapping; neuroimaging; neuromodulation; tDCS; tES","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17020,""
"Advanced informatics understanding of clinician-patient communication: A mixed-method approach to oral health literacy talk in interpreter-mediated pediatric dentistry","In the clinical dental consultation, multi-party configurations predominate with the presence of parents/ primary caregivers in pediatric dentistry adding another layer of complexity. In managing child oral healthcare, parents/ primary caregivers are critical, especially in dental caries prevention. This study aimed (1) to identify the structure of oral health literacy (OHL) talk in interpreter-mediated pediatric dentistry and (2) to analyze interpreter contributions to the communication strategies: patient-centered direct interpreting (PC-DI), patient-centered mediated interpreting (PC-MI), clinician-centered direct interpreting (CC-DI), and clinician-centered mediated interpreting (CC-MI). Visual text analysis (VTA) of video recorded pediatric clinical consultations in Hong Kong utilized DiscursisÃ¢â€žÂ¢ software to illustrate temporal and topical structures and their distribution across turns-at-talk. Conversation analysis (CA) was applied to analyze turn-taking of the identified OHL talk qualitatively. The mixed-method approach of combining VTA and CA was applied to analyze the patterns and features of the recorded OHL talk. The conceptual recurrences of the 77 transcribed video recordings were plotted visually. CC- and PC-OHL talk were identified by the recurrence patterns of monochromatic and multi-colored triangular clusters formed by off-diagonal boxes, respectively. CA of interpreter-mediated turns supported earlier findings regarding patterns of MI in multilingual adult dental consultations; however, the role of the interpreter in parent/ primary caregiver education and patient management was more distinctive in the pediatric dentistry. The mixed-method approach assisted in unpacking the complexities of the multi-party interactions, supported identification of effective communication strategies, and illustrated the roles of the dental professionals in initiating CC- and PC-OHL talk in pediatric dentistry. The intervention showed the implication of the professional education of evidence-based practices for clinicians in balancing agenda management and the communicative dimension of OHL with the help of VTA and CA in multilingual consultations.","Wong, Bridges, Ma, Yiu, McGrath, Zayts","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230575","20200629","Adult; Caregivers; Child; Communication; Female; Health Literacy; Humans; Male; Multilingualism; Oral Health; Parents; Patient-Centered Care; Pediatric Dentistry; Physician-Patient Relations; Physicians; Video Recording","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17021,""
"A systematic review of the applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in autoimmune diseases","Autoimmune diseases are chronic, multifactorial conditions. Through machine learning (ML), a branch of the wider field of artificial intelligence, it is possible to extract patterns within patient data, and exploit these patterns to predict patient outcomes for improved clinical management. Here, we surveyed the use of ML methods to address clinical problems in autoimmune disease. A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, embase and computers and applied sciences complete databases. Relevant papers included &quot;machine learning&quot; or &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; and the autoimmune diseases search term(s) in their title, abstract or key words. Exclusion criteria: studies not written in English, no real human patient data included, publication prior to 2001, studies that were not peer reviewed, non-autoimmune disease comorbidity research and review papers. 169 (of 702) studies met the criteria for inclusion. Support vector machines and random forests were the most popular ML methods used. ML models using data on multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease were most common. A small proportion of studies (7.7% or 13/169) combined different data types in the modelling process. Cross-validation, combined with a separate testing set for more robust model evaluation occurred in 8.3% of papers (14/169). The field may benefit from adopting a best practice of validation, cross-validation and independent testing of ML models. Many models achieved good predictive results in simple scenarios (e.g. classification of cases and controls). Progression to more complex predictive models may be achievable in future through integration of multiple data types.","Stafford, Kellermann, Mossotto, Beattie, MacArthur, Ennis","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-020-0229-3","20200928","Autoimmune diseases; Machine learning; Predictive medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17022,""
"A clustering approach for topic filtering within systematic literature reviews","Within a systematic literature review (SLR), researchers are confronted with vast amounts of articles from scientific databases, which have to be manually evaluated regarding their relevance for a certain field of observation. The evaluation and filtering phase of prevalent SLR methodologies is therefore time consuming and hardly expressible to the intended audience. The proposed method applies natural language processing (NLP) on article meta data and a k-means clustering algorithm to automatically convert large article corpora into a distribution of focal topics. This allows efficient filtering as well as objectifying the process through the discussion of the clustering results. Beyond that, it allows to quickly identify scientific communities and therefore provides an iterative perspective for the so far linear SLR methodology.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢NLP and k-means clustering to filter large article corpora during systematic literature reviews.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Automated clustering allows filtering very efficiently as well as effectively compared to manual selection.Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Presentation and discussion of the clustering results helps to objectify the nontransparent filtering step in systematic literature reviews.","WeiÃƒÅ¸er, SaÃƒÅ¸mannshausen, Ohrndorf, BurggrÃƒÂ¤f, Wagner","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2020.100831","20200928","Clustering; Literature filtering; Systematic literature review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17023,""
"Clinical validation of urine-based XpertÃ‚Â® MTB/RIF assay for the diagnosis of urogenital tuberculosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Effective methods for diagnosing urogenital tuberculosis (UGTB) are important for its clinical management. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review to assess the performance of the urine-based Xpert MTB/RIF assay for UGTB. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane library, and Scopus were systematically searched up to July 30, 2019. A hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) was applied to calculate the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and odds ratio (OR) for the diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert test. Our search identified 858 unique articles from which 69 studies were selected for full-text revision, with 12 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Eleven studies comprising 1202 samples compared Xpert with mycobacterial culture, while 924 samples from eight studies compared it with a composite reference standard (CRS). The values for pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, and OR were 0.89, 0.95, 20.1, 0.18, and 159.53, respectively, when compared with the mycobacterial culture. Likewise, when compared with a CRS, the respective pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, and OR values were 0.55, 0.99, 40.67, 0.43, and 166.17, thereby suggesting a high level of accuracy for diagnosing UGTB. A meta-regression and sub-group analysis of TB-burden countries, study design, decontamination, concentration, and reference standard could not explain the heterogeneity (p &gt; 0.05) in the diagnostic efficiency.

"The contribution of electronic health records to risk management through accreditation of residential aged care homes in Australia","The Australian government has implemented a compulsory aged care accreditation system to guide and monitor the risk management approach in registered residential aged care (RAC) homes. This research assessed the contribution of electronic health records (EHR) to risk management in RAC homes in relation to the extent that aged care accreditation fulfils its role. A convenience sample of 5560 aged care accreditation reports published from 2011 to 2018 was manually downloaded from the Accreditation Agency web site. A mixed-method approach of text data mining and manual content analysis was used to identify any significant differences in failure to meet accreditation outcomes among the RAC homes. This took account of whether EHR or paper records were used, year of accreditation, and size and location of the homes. It appears that aged care accreditation was focused on structure and process, with limited attention to outcome. There was a big variation between homes in their use of measurement indicators to assess accreditation outcomes. No difference was found in outcomes between RAC homes using EHR and those using paper records. Only 3% of the RAC homes were found to have failed some accreditation outcomes. Failure in monitoring mechanism was the key factor for failing many accreditation outcomes. The top five failed outcomes were Human Resource Management, Clinical Care, Information Systems, Medication Management and Behavioural Management. Sub-optimal outcomes have limited the effectiveness of accreditation in driving and monitoring risk management for care recipient safety in RAC homes. Although EHR is an important structure and process component for RAC services, it made a limited contribution to risk management for accreditation in Australian RAC homes. Either EHR was not effective, or the accreditation process was not robust enough to recognize its influence. Aged care accreditation in Australia needs to develop further outcome-based measures that are supported by robust data infrastructure and clear guidance.","Yu, Jiang, Hailey, Ma, Qian","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-1070-y","20201005","Accreditation; Electronic health records; Information system; Long term care; Nursing home; Nursing records; Risk management; Standard; Accreditation; Aged; Australia; Electronic Health Records; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Nursing Homes; Risk Management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17025,""
"Research Insights on Neural Effects of Auditory Deprivation and Restoration in Unilateral Hearing Loss: A Systematic Review","Neuroplasticity following bilateral deafness and auditory restoration has been repeatedly investigated. In clinical practice, however, a significant number of patients present a severe-to-profound unilateral hearing loss (UHL). To date, less is known about the neuroplasticity following monaural hearing deprivation and auditory input restoration. This article provides an overview of the current research insights on the impact of UHL on the brain and the effect of auditory input restoration with a cochlear implant (CI). An exhaustive systematic review of the literature was performed selecting 38 studies that apply different neural analyses techniques. The main results show that the hearing ear becomes functionally dominant after monaural deprivation, reshaping the lateralization of the neural network for auditory processing, a process that can be considered to influence auditory restoration. Furthermore, animal models predict that the onset time of UHL impacts auditory restoration. Hence, the results seem to advocate for early restoration of UHL, although further research is required to disambiguate the effects of duration and onset of UHL on auditory restoration and on structural neuroplasticity following UHL deprivation and restoration. Ongoing developments on CI devices compatible with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examinations will provide a unique opportunity to investigate structural and functional neuroplasticity following CI restoration more directly.","Vanderauwera, Hellemans, Verhaert","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9030812","20200928","brain plasticity; cochlear implant (CI); congenital deafness; cross-modal reorganization; intra-modal reorganization; neuroimaging; postlingual deafness; single-sided deafness; unilateral hearing loss","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17026,""
"Cerebellar Contributions to Proactive and Reactive Control in the Stop Signal Task: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies","The cerebellum facilitates and modulates cognitive functions using forward and inverse internal models to predict and control behavior, respectively. Despite neuroimaging evidence that regions of the cerebellum are active during executive function (EF) tasks in general, little is known about the cerebellum's role in specific EFs and their underlying neural networks. Inhibitory control specifically may be facilitated by cerebellar internal models predicting responses during proactive control (withholding), and controlling responses during reactive control (inhibiting). The stop signal task (SST) is an inhibitory control task often used in neuroimaging studies to measure neural responses to both proactive and reactive control. Thus, in this review, we examine evidence for the cerebellum's role in inhibitory control by reviewing studies of healthy adults that utilized the SST in event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments. Twenty-one studies that demonstrated cerebellar results were eligible for review, including 749 participants, 28 contrasts, and 38 cerebellar clusters. We also performed activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of contrasts derived from reviewed studies. This review illustrates evidence for the cerebellum participating in inhibitory control independent of motor control. Most significant cerebellar clusters were located in the left posterior cerebellum, suggesting that it communicates with the established cortical right-lateralized inhibitory control network. Cerebellar activity was most consistently observed for contrasts that measured proactive control, and ALE analysis confirmed that left Crus I is most likely to be activated in studies of proactive control measuring monitoring and anticipation. Results suggest that the left posterior cerebellum may communicate with right frontal and parietal cortices, using forward models to predict appropriate responses. Reactive control contrasts indicated a possible role for cerebellar regions in enhancing inhibition efficiency through inverse models, but ALE meta-analysis did not confirm this hypothesis. Limitations in the current literature, clinical implications, and directions for future research are discussed.","Clark, King, Turner","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11065-020-09432-w","20200929","Cerebellum; Executive function; Inhibitory control; Response inhibition; Stop signal; fMRI","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17027,""
"Pharmacological Treatment of Methamphetamine/Amphetamine Dependence: A Systematic Review","Stimulant drugs are second only to cannabis as the most widely used class of illicit drug globally, accounting for 68 million past-year consumers. Dependence on amphetamines (AMPH) or methamphetamine (MA) is a growing global concern. Yet, there is no established pharmacotherapy for AMPH/MA dependence. A comprehensive assessment of the research literature on pharmacotherapy for AMPH/MA dependence may inform treatment guidelines and future research directions. We systematically reviewed the peer-reviewed literature via the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and SCOPUS for randomised controlled trials reported in the English language examining a pharmacological treatment for AMPH/MA dependence or use disorder. We included all studies published to 19 June 2019. The selected studies were evaluated for design; methodology; inclusion and exclusion criteria; sample size; pharmacological and (if included) psychosocial interventions; length of follow-up and follow-up schedules; outcome variables and measures; results; overall conclusions and risk of bias. Outcome measures were any reported impact of treatment related to AMPH/MA use. Our search returned 43 studies that met our criteria, collectively enrolling 4065 participants and reporting on 23 individual pharmacotherapies, alone or in combination. Disparate outcomes and measures (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°55 for the primary outcomes) across studies did not allow for meta-analyses. Some studies demonstrated mixed or weak positive signals (often in defined populations, e.g. men who have sex with men), with some variation in efficacy signals dependent on baseline frequency of AMPH/MA use. The most consistent positive findings have been demonstrated with stimulant agonist treatment (dexamphetamine and methylphenidate), naltrexone and topiramate. Less consistent benefits have been shown with the antidepressants bupropion and mirtazapine, the glutamatergic agent riluzole and the corticotropin releasing factor (CRF-1) antagonist pexacerfont; whilst in general, antidepressant medications (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) have not been effective in reducing AMPH/MA use. No pharmacotherapy yielded convincing results for the treatment of AMPH/MA dependence; mostly studies were underpowered and had low treatment completion rates. However, there were positive signals from several agents that warrant further investigation in larger scale studies; agonist therapies show promise. Common outcome measures should include change in use days. Future research must address the heterogeneity of AMPH/MA dependence (e.g. coexisting conditions, severity of disorder, differences between MA and AMPH dependence) and the role of psychosocial intervention.","Siefried, Acheson, Lintzeris, Ezard","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40263-020-00711-x","20200818","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17028,""

"SuperCYPsPred-a web server for the prediction of cytochrome activity","Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs)-mediated drug metabolism influences drug pharmacokinetics and results in adverse outcomes in patients through drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) issues are the leading causes for the failure of a drug in the clinical trials. As details on their metabolism are known for just half of the approved drugs, a tool for reliable prediction of CYPs specificity is needed. The SuperCYPsPred web server is currently focused on five major CYPs isoenzymes, which includes CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 that are responsible for more than 80% of the metabolism of clinical drugs. The prediction models for classification of the CYPs inhibition are based on well-established machine learning methods. The models were validated both on cross-validation and external validation sets and achieved good performance. The web server takes a 2D chemical structure as input and reports the CYP inhibition profile of the chemical for 10 models using different molecular fingerprints, along with confidence scores, similar compounds, known CYPs information of drugs-published in literature, detailed interaction profile of individual cytochromes including a DDIs table and an overall CYPs prediction radar chart (http://insilico-cyp.charite.de/SuperCYPsPred/).

"Radiomic prediction of mutation status based on MR imaging of lung cancer brain metastases","Lung cancer metastases comprise most of all brain metastases in adults and most brain metastases are diagnosed by magnetic resonance (MR) scans. The purpose of this study was to conduct an MR imaging-based radiomic analysis of brain metastatic lesions from patients with primary lung cancer to classify mutational status of the metastatic disease. We retrospectively identified lung cancer patients with brain metastases treated at our institution between 2009 and 2017 who underwent genotype testing of their primary lung cancer. Brain MR Images were used for segmentation of enhancing tumors and peritumoral edema, and for radiomic feature extraction. The most relevant radiomic features were identified and used with clinical data to train random forest classifiers to classify the mutation status. Of 110 patients in the study cohort (mean age 57.51Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 12.32Ã‚Â years; M: FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 37:73), 75 had an EGFR mutation, 21 had an ALK translocation, and 15 had a KRAS mutation. One patient had both ALK translocation and EGFR mutation. Majority of radiomic features most relevant for mutation classification were textural. Model building using both radiomic features and clinical data yielded more accurate classifications than using either alone. For classification of EGFR, ALK, and KRAS mutation status, the model built with both radiomic features and clinical data resulted in area-under-the-curve (AUC) values based on cross-validation of 0.912, 0.915, and 0.985, respectively. Our study demonstrated that MR imaging-based radiomic analysis of brain metastases in patients with primary lung cancer may be used to classify mutation status.

"Neuromodulation Techniques in Phantom Limb Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","To evaluate the effects of neuromodulation techniques in adults with phantom limb pain (PLP). A systematic search was performed, comprising randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental (QE) studies that were published from database inception to February 2019 and that measured the effects of neuromodulation in adults with PLP. Hedge's g effect size (ES) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Fourteen studies (nine RCTs and five QE noncontrolled studies) were included. The meta-analysis of RCTs showed significant effects for i) excitatory primary motor cortex (M1) stimulation in reducing pain after stimulation (ES = -1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -2.26 to -0.45); ii) anodal M1 transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in lowering pain after stimulation (ES = -1.50, 95% CI = -2.05 to 0.95), and one-week follow-up (ES = -1.04, 95% CI = -1.64 to 0.45). The meta-analysis of noncontrolled QE studies demonstrated a high rate of pain reduction after stimulation with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (rate = 67%, 95% CI = 60% to 73%) and at one-year follow-up with deep brain stimulation (rate = 73%, 95% CI = 63% to 82%). The evidence from RCTs suggests that excitatory M1 stimulation-specifically, anodal M1 tDCS-has a significant short-term effect in reducing pain scale scores in PLP.

"Towards data-driven medical imaging using natural language processing in patients with suspected urolithiasis","The majority of radiological reports are still written as free text and lack structure. Further evaluation of free-text reports is difficult to achieve without a great deal of manual effort, and is not possible in everyday clinical practice. This study aims to automatically capture clinical information and positive hit rates from narrative radiological reports of suspected urolithiasis using natural language processing (NLP). Narrative reports of low dose computed tomography (CT) of the retroperitoneum from April 2016 to July 2018 (n = 1714) were analyzed using NLP. These free-text reports were automatically structured based on RadLex concepts. Manual feedback was used to test and train the NLP engine to further enhance the performance. The chi-squared test, phi coefficient, and logistic regression analysis were performed to determine the effect of clinical information on the positive hit rate of urolithiasis. Urolithiasis was affirmed in 72 % of the reports; in 38 % at least one stone was described in the kidneys, and in 45 % at least one stone was described in the ureter. Clinical information, such as previous stone history and obstructive uropathy, showed a strong correlation with confirmed urolithiasis (p = 0.001).

"Lessons Learned About Autonomous AI: Finding a Safe, Efficacious, and Ethical Path Through the Development Process","Artificial intelligence (AI) describes systems capable of making decisions of high cognitive complexity; autonomous AI systems in healthcare are AI systems that make clinical decisions without human oversight. Such rigorously validated medical diagnostic AI systems hold great promise for improving access to care, increasing accuracy, and lowering cost, while enabling specialist physicians to provide the greatest value by managing and treating patients whose outcomes can be improved. Ensuring that autonomous AI provides these benefits requires evaluation of the autonomous AI's effect on patient outcome, design, validation, data usage, and accountability, from a bioethics and accountability perspective. We performed a literature review of bioethical principles for AI, and derived evaluation rules for autonomous AI, grounded in bioethical principles. The rules include patient outcome, validation, reference standard, design, data usage, and accountability for medical liability. Application of the rules explains successful US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) de novo authorization of an example, the first autonomous point-of-care diabetic retinopathy examination de novo authorized by the FDA, after a preregistered clinical trial. Physicians need to become competent in understanding the potential risks and benefits of autonomous AI, and understand its design, safety, efficacy and equity, validation, and liability, as well as how its data were obtained. The autonomous AI evaluation rules introduced here can help physicians understand limitations and risks as well as the potential benefits of autonomous AI for their patients.","AbrÃƒÂ moff, Tobey, Char","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2020.02.022","20200724","Artificial Intelligence; Ethics, Medical; Humans; Liability, Legal; Ophthalmology; Risk Assessment; Safety Management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17036,""

"Machine learning prediction of oncology drug targets based on protein and network properties","The selection and prioritization of drug targets is a central problem in drug discovery. Computational approaches can leverage the growing number of large-scale human genomics and proteomics data to make in-silico target identification, reducing the cost and the time needed. We developed a machine learning approach to score proteins to generate a druggability score of novel targets. In our model we incorporated 70 protein features which included properties derived from the sequence, features characterizing protein functions as well as network properties derived from the protein-protein interaction network. The advantage of this approach is that it is unbiased and even less studied proteins with limited information about their function can score well as most of the features are independent of the accumulated literature. We build models on a training set which consist of targets with approved drugs and a negative set of non-drug targets. The machine learning techniques help to identify the most important combination of features differentiating validated targets from non-targets. We validated our predictions on an independent set of clinical trial drug targets, achieving a high accuracy characterized by an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.89. Our most predictive features included biological function of proteins, network centrality measures, protein essentiality, tissue specificity, localization and solvent accessibility. Our predictions, based on a small set of 102 validated oncology targets, recovered the majority of known drug targets and identifies a novel set of proteins as drug target candidates. We developed a machine learning approach to prioritize proteins according to their similarity to approved drug targets. We have shown that the method proposed is highly predictive on a validation dataset consisting of 277 targets of clinical trial drug confirming that our computational approach is an efficient and cost-effective tool for drug target discovery and prioritization. Our predictions were based on oncology targets and cancer relevant biological functions, resulting in significantly higher scores for targets of oncology clinical trial drugs compared to the scores of targets of trial drugs for other indications. Our approach can be used to make indication specific drug-target prediction by combining generic druggability features with indication specific biological functions.","DezsÃ…â€˜, Ceccarelli","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-3442-9","20200514","Drug target prioritization; Machine learning; Network analysis; Antineoplastic Agents; Area Under Curve; Computer Simulation; Drug Discovery; Genomics; Humans; Machine Learning; Protein Interaction Maps; Proteins","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17038,""

"Artificial intelligence and radiomics enhance the positive predictive value of digital chest tomosynthesis for lung cancer detection within SOS clinical trial","To enhance the positive predictive value (PPV) of chest digital tomosynthesis (DTS) in the lung cancer detection with the analysis of radiomics features. The investigation was carried out within the SOS clinical trial (NCT03645018) for lung cancer screening with DTS. Lung nodules were identified by visual analysis and then classified using the diameter and the radiological aspect of the nodule following lung-RADS. Haralick texture features were extracted from the segmented nodules. Both semantic variables and radiomics features were used to build a predictive model using logistic regression on a subset of variables selected with backward feature selection and using two machine learning: a Random Forest and a neural network with the whole subset of variables. The methods were applied to a train set and validated on a test set where diagnostic accuracy metrics were calculated. Binary visual analysis had a good sensitivity (0.95) but a low PPV (0.14). Lung-RADS classification increased the PPV (0.19) but with an unacceptable low sensitivity (0.65). Logistic regression showed a mildly increased PPV (0.29) but a lower sensitivity (0.20). Random Forest demonstrated a moderate PPV (0.40) but with a low sensitivity (0.30). Neural network demonstrated to be the best predictor with a high PPV (0.95) and a high sensitivity (0.90). The neural network demonstrated the best PPV. The use of visual analysis along with neural network could help radiologists to reduce the number of false positive in DTS.

"Using the Shapes of Clinical Data Trajectories to Predict Mortality in ICUs","1) To show how to exploit the information contained in the trajectories of time-varying patient clinical data for dynamic predictions of mortality in the ICU; and 2) to demonstrate the additional predictive value that can be achieved by incorporating this trajectory information. Observational, retrospective study of patient medical records for training and testing of statistical learning models using different sets of predictor variables. Medical ICU at the Yale-New Haven Hospital. Electronic health records of 3,763 patients admitted to the medical ICU between January 2013 and January 2015. None. Six-hour mortality predictions for ICU patients were generated and updated every 6 hours by applying the random forest classifier to patient time series data from the prior 24 hours. The time series were processed in different ways to create two main models: 1) manual extraction of the summary statistics used in the literature (min/max/median/first/last/number of measurements) and 2) automated extraction of trajectory features using machine learning. Out-of-sample area under the receiver operating characteristics curve and area under the precision-recall curve (&quot;precision&quot; refers to positive predictive value and &quot;recall&quot; to sensitivity) were used to evaluate the predictive performance of the two models. For 6-hour prediction and updating, the second model achieved area under the receiver operating characteristics curve and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.905 (95% CI, 0.900-0.910) and 0.381 (95% CI, 0.368-0.394), respectively, which are statistically significantly higher than those achieved by the first model, with area under the receiver operating characteristics curve and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.896 (95% CI, 0.892-0.900) and 0.905 (95% CI, 0.353-0.379). The superiority of the second model held true for 12-hour prediction/updating as well as for 24-hour prediction/updating. We show that statistical learning techniques can be used to automatically extract all relevant shape features for use in predictive modeling. The approach requires no additional data and can potentially be used to improve any risk model that uses some form of trajectory information. In this single-center study, the shapes of the clinical data trajectories convey information about ICU mortality risk beyond what is already captured by the summary statistics currently used in the literature.","Ma, Lee, Perkins, Pisani, Pinker","https://doi.org/10.1097/CCE.0000000000000010","20200928","hospital mortality; informatics; machine learning; prognosis; statistical models; time-dependent covariates","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17041,""

Prior to the TBL, students were provided with learning objectives and a list of advance preparation resources. These resources included a reading assignment from the student textbook, as well as optional online videos and optional online interactive quizzes. The students then came to class and completed an individual readiness assurance test (iRAT) and a group readiness assurance test (gRAT). The majority of in-class time was spent working through complex application exercises in the form of case vignettes. The TBLs were facilitated by a faculty member in the OB/GYN department. Since its initiation in June 2018, 93 students have participated in this TBL activity. The mean score on the iRAT was 88.9%, and the mean score on the gRAT was 98.8%. Ninety-eight percent of students reported that they were satisfied with this learning activity.

"An immune-centric exploration of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation related breast and ovarian cancers","BRCA1/2 germline mutation related cancers are candidates for new immune therapeutic interventions. This study was a hypothesis generating exploration of genomic data collected at diagnosis for 19 patients. The prominent tumor mutation burden (TMB) in hereditary breast and ovarian cancers in this cohort was not correlated with high global immune activity in their microenvironments. More information is needed about the relationship between genomic instability, phenotypes and immune microenvironments of these hereditary tumors in order to find appropriate markers of immune activity and the most effective anticancer immune strategies. Mining and statistical analyses of the original DNA and RNA sequencing data and The Cancer Genome Atlas data were performed. To interpret the data, we have used published literature and web available resources such as Gene Ontology, The Cancer immunome Atlas and the Cancer Research Institute iAtlas. We found that BRCA1/2 germline related breast and ovarian cancers do not represent a unique phenotypic identity, but they express a range of phenotypes similar to sporadic cancers. All breast and ovarian BRCA1/2 related tumors are characterized by high homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and low aneuploidy. Interestingly, all sporadic high grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) and most of the subtypes of triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) also express a high degree of HRD. TMB is not associated with the magnitude of the immune response in hereditary BRCA1/2 related breast and ovarian cancers or in sporadic TNBC and sporadic HGSOC. Hereditary tumors express phenotypes as heterogenous as sporadic tumors with various degree of &quot;BRCAness&quot; and various characteristics of the immune microenvironments. The subtyping criteria developed for sporadic tumors can be applied for the classification of hereditary tumors and possibly also characterization of their immune microenvironment. A high HRD score may be a good candidate biomarker for response to platinum, and potentially PARP-inhibition.

"Estimating an individual's oxygen uptake during cycling exercise with a recurrent neural network trained from easy-to-obtain inputs: A pilot study","Measurement of oxygen uptake during exercise ([Formula: see text]) is currently non-accessible to most individuals without expensive and invasive equipment. The goal of this pilot study was to estimate cycling [Formula: see text] from easy-to-obtain inputs, such as heart rate, mechanical power output, cadence and respiratory frequency. To this end, a recurrent neural network was trained from laboratory cycling data to predict [Formula: see text] values. Data were collected on 7 amateur cyclists during a graded exercise test, two arbitrary protocols (Prot-1 and -2) and an &quot;all-out&quot; Wingate test. In Trial-1, a neural network was trained with data from a graded exercise test, Prot-1 and Wingate, before being tested against Prot-2. In Trial-2, a neural network was trained using data from the graded exercise test, Prot-1 and 2, before being tested against the Wingate test. Two analytical models (Models 1 and 2) were used to compare the predictive performance of the neural network. Predictive performance of the neural network was high during both Trial-1 (MAE = 229(35) mlO2min-1, r = 0.94) and Trial-2 (MAE = 304(150) mlO2min-1, r = 0.89). As expected, the predictive ability of Models 1 and 2 deteriorated from Trial-1 to Trial-2.

"Post-treatment Lyme Disease as a Model for Persistent Symptoms in Lyme Disease","It has long been observed in clinical practice that a subset of patients with Lyme disease report a constellation of symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive difficulties, and musculoskeletal pain, which may last for a significant period of time. These symptoms, which can range from mild to severe, have been reported throughout the literature in both prospective and population-based studies in Lyme disease endemic regions. The etiology of these symptoms is unknown, however several illness-causing mechanisms have been hypothesized, including microbial persistence, host immune dysregulation through inflammatory or secondary autoimmune pathways, or altered neural networks, as in central sensitization. Evaluation and characterization of persistent symptoms in Lyme disease is complicated by potential independent, repeat exposures to <i>B. burgdorferi</i>, as well as the potential for co-morbid diseases with overlapping symptom profiles. Antibody testing for <i>B. burgdorferi</i> is an insensitive measure after treatment, and no other FDA-approved tests currently exist. As such, diagnosis presents a complex challenge for physicians, while the lived experience for patients is one marked by uncertainty and often illness invalidation. Currently, there are no FDA-approved pharmaceutical therapies, and the safety and efficacy of off-label and/or complementary therapies have not been well studied and are not agreed-upon within the medical community. Post-treatment Lyme disease represents a narrow, defined, mechanistically-neutral subset of this larger, more heterogeneous group of patients, and is a useful definition in research settings as an initial subgroup of study. The aim of this paper is to review the current literature on the diagnosis, etiology, risk factors, and treatment of patients with persistent symptoms in the context of Lyme disease. The meaning and relevance of existing patient subgroups will be discussed, as will future research priorities, including the need to develop illness biomarkers, elucidate the biologic mechanisms of disease, and drive improvements in therapeutic options.","Rebman, Aucott","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00057","20200928","Lyme disease; clinical presentation; post-treatment Lyme disease; research priorities; review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17045,""
"Systematic analysis of ovarian cancer platinum-resistance mechanisms via text mining","Platinum resistance is an important cause of clinical recurrence and death for ovarian cancer. This study tries to systematically explore the molecular mechanisms for platinum resistance in ovarian cancer and identify regulatory genes and pathways via text mining and other methods. Genes in abstracts of associated literatures were identified. Gene ontology andÃ‚Â protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were performed. Then co-occurrence between genes and ovarian cancer subtypes were carried out followed by cluster analysis. Genes with highest frequencies are mostly involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, metal transport and drug detoxification, which are closely related to platinum resistance. Gene ontology analysis confirms this result. Some proteins such as TP53, HSP90, ESR1, AKT1, BRCA1, EGFR and CTNNB1 work as hub nodes in PPI network. According to cluster analysis, specific genes were highlighted in each subtype of ovarian cancer, indicating that various subtypes may have different resistance mechanisms respectively. Platinum resistance in ovarian cancer involves complicated signaling pathways and different subtypes may have specific mechanisms. Text mining, combined with other bio-information methods, is an effective way for systematic analysis.","Li, Li, Gao, Zhen, Feng","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13048-020-00627-6","20201013","Ovarian cancer; Platinum resistance; Text mining; Antineoplastic Agents; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Data Mining; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Organoplatinum Compounds; Ovarian Neoplasms; Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Interaction Maps; Transcriptome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17046,""
"Artificial neural network analysis of bone quality DXA parameters response to teriparatide in fractured osteoporotic patients","Teriparatide is a bone-forming therapy for osteoporosis that increases bone quantity and texture, with uncertain action on bone geometry. No data are available regarding its influence on bone strain. To investigate teriparatide action on parameters of bone quantity and quality and on Bone Strain Index (BSI), also derived from DXA lumbar scan, based on the mathematical model finite element method. Forty osteoporotic patients with fractures were studied before and after two years of daily subcutaneous 20 mcg of teriparatide with dual X-ray photon absorptiometry to assess bone mineral density (BMD), hip structural analysis (HSA), trabecular bone score (TBS), BSI. Spine deformity index (SDI) was calculated from spine X-ray. Shapiro-Wilks, Wilcoxon and Student's t test were used for classical statistical analysis. Auto Contractive Map was used for Artificial Neural Network Analysis (ANNs). In the entire population, the ameliorations after therapy regarded BSI (-13.9%), TBS (5.08%), BMD (8.36%). HSA parameters of femoral shaft showed a worsening. Dividing patients into responders (BMD increase &gt;10%) and non-responders, the first presented TBS and BSI ameliorations (11.87% and -25.46%, respectively). Non-responders presented an amelioration of BSI only, but less than in the other subgroup (-6.57%). ANNs maps reflect the mentioned bone quality improvements. Teriparatide appears to ameliorate not only BMD and TBS, but also BSI, suggesting an increase of bone strength that may explain the known reduction in fracture risk, not simply justified by BMD increase. BSI appears to be a sensitive index of TPD effect. ANNs appears to be a valid tool to investigate complex clinical systems.","Messina, Piodi, Grossi, Eller-Vainicher, Bianchi, Ortolani, Di Stefano, Rinaudo, Sconfienza, Ulivieri","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229820","20200720","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bone Density; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Bone and Bones; Calcium-Regulating Hormones and Agents; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Networks, Computer; Osteoporosis; Osteoporotic Fractures; Teriparatide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17047,""
"Clinical Documentation to Predict Factors Associated with Urinary Incontinence Following Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer","Advances in data collection provide opportunities to use population samples in identifying risk factors for urinary incontinence (UI), which occurs in up to 71% of men with prostate cancer following prostatectomy. Most studies on patient-centered outcomes use surveys or manual chart abstraction for data collection, which can be costly and difficult to scale. We sought to evaluate rates of and risk factors for UI following prostatectomy using natural language processing on electronic health record (EHR) data. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing prostatectomy for prostate cancer between January 2008 and August 2018 using EHR data from an academic medical center. UI incidence for each patient in the cohort was assessed using natural language processing from clinical notes generated pre- and postoperatively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate potential risk factors for postoperative UI at various time points within 2 years following surgery. We identified 3792 patients who underwent prostatectomy for prostate cancer. We found a significant association between preoperative UI and UI in the first (odds ratio [OR], 2.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-4.28) and second (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.04-4.83) years following surgery. Preoperative body mass index was also associated with UI in the second postoperative year (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21). We show that a natural language processing approach using clinical narratives can be used to assess risk for UI in prostate cancer patients. Unstructured clinical narrative text can help advance future population-level research in patient-centered outcomes and quality of care.","Li, Banerjee, Magnani, Blayney, Brooks, Hernandez-Boussard","https://doi.org/10.2147/RRU.S234178","20200928","natural language processing; patient-centered outcomes; prostate cancer; soft labels; urinary incontinence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17048,""
"Supervised and unsupervised language modelling in Chest X-Ray radiological reports","Chest radiography (CXR) is the most commonly used imaging modality and deep neural network (DNN) algorithms have shown promise in effective triage of normal and abnormal radiograms. Typically, DNNs require large quantities of expertly labelled training exemplars, which in clinical contexts is a major bottleneck to effective modelling, as both considerable clinical skill and time is required to produce high-quality ground truths. In this work we evaluate thirteen supervised classifiers using two large free-text corpora and demonstrate that bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks with attention mechanism effectively identify Normal, Abnormal, and Unclear CXR reports in internal (n = 965 manually-labelled reports, f1-score = 0.94) and external (n = 465 manually-labelled reports, f1-score = 0.90) testing sets using a relatively small number of expert-labelled training observations (n = 3,856 annotated reports). Furthermore, we introduce a general unsupervised approach that accurately distinguishes Normal and Abnormal CXR reports in a large unlabelled corpus. We anticipate that the results presented in this work can be used to automatically extract standardized clinical information from free-text CXR radiological reports, facilitating the training of clinical decision support systems for CXR triage.","Drozdov, Forbes, Szubert, Hall, Carlin, Lowe","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229963","20200619","Datasets as Topic; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Lung Diseases; Neural Networks, Computer; Radiography; Supervised Machine Learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17049,""
"Machine Learning techniques in breast cancer prognosis prediction: A primary evaluation","More than 750Ã‚Â 000 women in Italy are surviving a diagnosis of breast cancer. A large body of literature tells us which characteristics impact the most on their prognosis. However, the prediction of each disease course and then the establishment of a therapeutic plan and follow-up tailored to the patient is still very complicated. In order to address this issue, a multidisciplinary approach has become widely accepted, while the Multigene Signature Panels and the Nottingham Prognostic Index are still discussed options. The current technological resources permit to gather many data for each patient. Machine Learning (ML) allows us to draw on these data, to discover their mutual relations and to esteem the prognosis for the new instances. This study provides a primary evaluation of the application of ML to predict breast cancer prognosis. We analyzed 1021 patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer in our Institute and we included 610 of them. Three outcomes were chosen: cancer recurrence (both loco-regional and systemic) and death from the disease within 32Ã‚Â months. We developed two types of ML models for every outcome (Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine). Each ML algorithm was tested in accuracy (=95.29%-96.86%), sensitivity (=0.35-0.64), specificity (=0.97-0.99), and AUC (=0.804-0.916). These models might become an additional resource to evaluate the prognosis of breast cancer patients in our daily clinical practice. Before that, we should increase their sensitivity, according to literature, by considering a wider population sample with a longer period of follow-up. However, specificity, accuracy, minimal additional costs, and reproducibility are already encouraging.","Boeri, Chiappa, Galli, De Berardinis, Bardelli, Carcano, Rovera","https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.2811","20200505","Artificial Neural Network (ANN); Support Vector Machine (SVM); algorithm; breast cancer; predictive models","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17050,""
"Measuring the Motor Aspect of Cancer-Related Fatigue using a Handheld Dynamometer","Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is commonly reported by patients both during and after receiving treatment for cancer. Current CRF diagnoses rely on self-report questionnaires which are subject to report and recall biases. Objective measurements using a handheld dynamometer, or handgrip device, have been shown in recent studies to correlate significantly with subjective self-reported fatigue scores. However, variations of both the handgrip fatigue test and fatigue index calculations exist in the literature.

"Natural Language Processing for Mimicking Clinical Trial Recruitment in Critical Care: AÃ‚Â Semi-Automated Simulation Based on the LeoPARDS Trial","Clinical trials often fail to recruit an adequate number of appropriate patients. Identifying eligible trial participants is resource-intensive when relying on manual review of clinical notes, particularly in critical care settings where the time window is short. Automated review of electronic health records (EHR) may help, but much of the information is in free text rather than a computable form. We applied natural language processing (NLP) to free text EHR data using the CogStack platform to simulate recruitment into the LeoPARDS study, a clinical trial aiming to reduce organ dysfunction in septic shock. We applied an algorithm to identify eligible patients using a moving 1-hour time window, and compared patients identified by our approach with those actually screened and recruited for the trial, for the time period that data were available. We manually reviewed records of a random sample of patients identified by the algorithm but not screened in the original trial. Our method identified 376 patients, including 34 patients with EHR data available who were actually recruited to LeoPARDS in our centre. The sensitivity of CogStack for identifying patients screened was 90% (95% CI 85%, 93%). Of the 203 patients identified by both manual screening and CogStack, the index date matched in 95 (47%) and CogStack was earlier in 94 (47%). In conclusion, analysis of EHR data using NLP could effectively replicate recruitment in a critical care trial, and identify some eligible patients at an earlier stage, potentially improving trial recruitment if implemented in real time.","Tissot, Shah, Brealey, Harris, Agbakoba, Folarin, Romao, Roguski, Dobson, Asselbergs","https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.2977925","20201008","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17052,""
"Mobile Peer-Support for Opioid Use Disorders: Refinement of an Innovative Machine Learning Tool","The majority of individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) do not receive any formal substance use treatment. Due to limited engagement and access to traditional treatment, there is increasing evidence that patients with OUDs turn to online social platforms to access peer support and obtain health-related information about addiction and recovery. Interacting with peers before and during recovery is a key component of many evidence-based addiction recovery programs, and may improve self-efficacy and treatment engagement as well as reduce relapse. Commonly-used online social platforms are limited in utility and scalability as an adjunct to addiction treatment; lack effective content moderation (e.g., misinformed advice, maliciousness or &quot;trolling&quot;); and lack common security and ethical safeguards inherent to clinical care. This present study will develop a novel, artificial-intelligence (AI) enabled, mobile treatment delivery method that fulfills the need for a robust, secure, technology-based peer support platform to support patients with OUD. Forty adults receiving outpatient buprenorphine treatment for OUD will be asked to pilot a smartphone-based mobile peer support application, the &quot;Marigold App&quot;, for a duration of six weeks. The program will use (1) a prospective cohort study to obtain text message content and feasibility metrics, and (2) qualitative interviews to evaluate usability and acceptability of the mobile platform. The Marigold mobile platform will allow patients to access a tailored chat support group 24/7 as a complement to different forms of clinical OUD treatment. Marigold can keep groups safe and constructive by augmenting chats with AI tools capable of understanding the emotional sentiment in messages, automatically &quot;flagging&quot; critical or clinically relevant content. This project will demonstrate the robustness of these AI tools by adapting them to catch OUD-specific &quot;flags&quot; in peer messages while also examining the adoptability of the platform itself within OUD patients.","Scherzer, Ranney, Jain, Bommaraju, Patena, Langdon, Nimaja, Jennings, Beaudoin","https://doi.org/10.20900/jpbs.20200001","20200928","application; machine-learning; mobile treatment; natural language processing; opioid use disorder; peer support; technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17053,""
"Mosaicism in Patients With Colorectal Cancer or Polyposis Syndromes: A Systematic Review","Somatic mosaicism, in which variants arise post-zygotically and are therefore not present in all cells in the body, may be an underestimated cause of colorectal cancer (CRC) and polyposis syndromes. We performed a systematic review to provide a comprehensive overview of somatic mosaicism in patients with CRC and polyposis syndromes. We searched PubMed through March 2018 to identify reports of mosaicism in patients with CRC or polyposis syndromes. We divided the final set of studies into 3 subgroups describing APC mosaicism, mosaicism in other CRC susceptibility genes, and epigenetic mosaicism. Of the 232 articles identified in our systematic search, 46 met the criteria for further analysis. Of these, 35 studies described mosaic variants or epimutations in patients with CRC or polyposis syndromes. Nineteen studies described APC mosaicism, comprising a total of 57 patients. Six described mosaicism in genes associated with familial CRC syndromes, such as Lynch and Cowden syndromes. Ten studies described epigenetic mosaicism, sometimes resulting from a germline variant (such as deletion of EPCAM). We found that somatic mosaicism is underdiagnosed but critical for determining the clinical management of patients with de novo polyposis who possibly carry mosaic APC variants, and present a decision tree for the clinical management of these patients. Mosaicism in genes associated with susceptibility to CRC contributes to development of other familial CRC syndromes. Heritable epigenetic mosaicism is likely underestimated and could have a dominant pattern of inheritance. However, the inheritance of primary mosaic epimutations, without an underlying genetic cause, is complex and not fully understood.","Jansen, Goel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2020.02.049","20200720","DNA; Genomic; Mutation; Risk Factor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17054,""
"Can natural language processing provide accurate, automated reporting of wound infection requiring reoperation after lumbar discectomy?","Surgical site infections are a major driver of morbidity and increased costs in the postoperative period after spine surgery. Current tools for surveillance of these adverse events rely on prospective clinical tracking, manual retrospective chart review, or administrative procedural and diagnosis codes. The purpose of this study was to develop natural language processing (NLP) algorithms for automated reporting of postoperative wound infection requiring reoperation after lumbar discectomy. Adult patients undergoing discectomy at two academic and three community medical centers between January 1, 2000 and July 31, 2019 for lumbar disc herniation. Reoperation for wound infection within 90 days after surgery METHODS: Free-text notes of patients who underwent surgery from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2015 were used for algorithm training. Free-text notes of patients who underwent surgery after January 1, 2016 were used for algorithm testing. Manual chart review was used to label which patients had reoperation for wound infection. An extreme gradient-boosting NLP algorithm was developed to detect reoperation for postoperative wound infection. Overall, 5,860 patients were included in this study and 62 (1.1%) had a reoperation for wound infection. In patients who underwent surgery after January 1, 2016 (n=1,377), the NLP algorithm detected 15 of the 16 patients (sensitivity=0.94) who had reoperation for infection. In comparison, current procedural terminology and international classification of disease codes detected 12 of these 16 patients (sensitivity=0.75). At a threshold of 0.05, the NLP algorithm had positive predictive value of 0.83 and F1-score of 0.88. Temporal validation of the algorithm developed in this study demonstrates a proof-of-concept application of NLP for automated reporting of adverse events after spine surgery. Adapting this methodology for other procedures and outcomes in spine and orthopedics has the potential to dramatically improve and automatize quality and safety reporting.","Karhade, Bongers, Groot, Cha, Doorly, Fogel, Hershman, Tobert, Schoenfeld, Kang, Harris, Bono, Schwab","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spinee.2020.02.021","20201005","Adverse events; Artificial intelligence; Complication; Disc herniation; Infection; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Prediction; Reoperation; Spine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17055,""
"Intraoperative integration of structured light scanning for automatic tissue classification: a feasibility study","Structured light scanning is a promising inexpensive and accurate intraoperative imaging modality. Integration of these scanners in surgical workflows has the potential to enable rapid registration and augment preoperative imaging, in a practical and timely manner in the operating theatre. Previously, we have demonstrated the intraoperative feasibility of such scanners to capture anatomical surface information with high accuracy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of automatically characterizing anatomical tissues from textural and spatial information captured by such scanners using machine learning. Assisted or automatic identification of relevant components of a captured scan is essential for effective integration of the technology in surgical workflow. During a clinical study, 3D surface scans for seven total knee arthroplasty patients were collected, and textural and spatial features for cartilage, bone, and ligament tissue were collected and annotated. These features were used to train and evaluate machine learning models. As part of our preliminary preparation, three fresh-frozen knee cadaver specimens were also used where 3D surface scans with texture information were collected during different dissection stages. The resulting models were manually segmented to isolate texture information for muscles, tendon, cartilage, and bone. This information, and detailed labels from dissections, provided an in-depth, finely annotated dataset for building machine learning classifiers. For characterizing bone, cartilage, and ligament in the intraoperative surface models, random forest and neural network-based models achieved an accuracy of close to 80%, whereas an accuracy of close to 90% was obtained when only characterizing bone and cartilage. Average accuracy of 76-82% was reached for cadaver data in two-, three-, and four-class tissue separation. The results of this project demonstrate the feasibility of machine learning methods to accurately classify multiple types of anatomical tissue. The ability to automatically characterize tissues in intraoperatively collected surface models would streamline the surgical workflow of using structured light scanners-paving the way to applications such as 3D documentation of surgery in addition to rapid registration and augmentation of preoperative imaging.","Chan, Rudan, Mousavi, Kunz","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02129-8","20201013","Intraoperative imaging; Structured light scanner; Surface scanning; Tissue classification; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Knee Joint; Machine Learning; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Neural Networks, Computer","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17056,""
"EMR-Based Phenotyping of Ischemic Stroke Using Supervised Machine Learning and Text Mining Techniques","Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability in adulthood worldwide. Because it has highly heterogeneous phenotypes, phenotyping of ischemic stroke is an essential task for medical research and clinical prognostication. However, this task is not a trivial one when the study population is large. Phenotyping of ischemic stroke depends primarily on manual annotation of medical records in previous studies. This article evaluated various strategies for automated phenotyping of ischemic stroke into the four subtypes of the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification based on structured and unstructured data from electronical medical records (EMRs). A total of 4640 adult patients who were hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke in a teaching hospital were included. In addition to the structured items in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, unstructured clinical narratives were preprocessed using MetaMap to identify medical concepts, which were then encoded into feature vectors. Various supervised machine learning algorithms were used to build classifiers. The study results indicate that textual information from EMRs could facilitate phenotyping of ischemic stroke when this information was combined with structured information. Furthermore, decomposition of this multi-class problem into binary classification tasks followed by aggregation of classification results could improve the performance.","Sung, Lin, Hu","https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.2976931","20201008","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17057,""
"Cardiac magnetic resonance radiomics: basic principles and clinical perspectives","Radiomics is a novel image analysis technique, whereby voxel-level information is extracted from digital images and used to derive multiple numerical quantifiers of shape and tissue character. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the reference imaging modality for assessment of cardiac structure and function. Conventional analysis of CMR scans is mostly reliant on qualitative image analysis and basic geometric quantifiers. Small proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated the feasibility and superior diagnostic accuracy of CMR radiomics analysis over conventional reporting. CMR radiomics has the potential to transform our approach to defining image phenotypes and, through this, improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment selection, and prognostication. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of radiomics concepts for clinicians, with particular consideration of application to CMR. We will also review existing literature on CMR radiomics, discuss challenges, and consider directions for future work.","Raisi-Estabragh, Izquierdo, Campello, Martin-Isla, Jaggi, Harvey, Lekadir, Petersen","https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jeaa028","20201026","cardiac magnetic resonance; image-based diagnosis; machine learning; radiomics; texture analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17058,""
"The greater inflammatory pathway-high clinical potential by innovative predictive, preventive, and personalized medical approach","Impaired wound healing (WH) and chronic inflammation are hallmarks of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). However, despite WH being a recognized player in NCDs, mainstream therapies focus on (un)targeted damping of the inflammatory response, leaving WH largely unaddressed, owing to three main factors.Ã‚Â The first is the complexity of the pathway that links inflammation and wound healing; the second is the dual nature, local and systemic, of WH; and the third is the limited acknowledgement of genetic and contingent causes that disrupt physiologic progression of WH. Here, in the frame of Predictive, Preventive, and Personalized Medicine (PPPM), we integrate and revisit current literature to offer a novel systemic view on the cues that can impact on the fate (acute or chronic inflammation) of WH, beyond the compartmentalization of medical disciplines and with the support of advanced computational biology. This shall open to a broader understanding of the causes for WH going awry, offering new operational criteria for patients' stratification (prediction and personalization). While this may also offer improved options for targeted prevention, we will envisage new therapeutic strategies to reboot and/or boost WH, to enable its progression across its physiological phases, the first of which is a transient acute inflammatory response versus the chronic low-grade inflammation characteristic of NCDs.","Maturo, Soligo, Gibson, Manni, Nardini","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-019-00195-w","20200928","Autonomic nervous system; Big data analysis; Epigenetics; Genetics; Individualized patient profile; Inflammation; Machine learning; Mechanotransduction; Multi-omics; Network science; Neuro-immuno modulation; Non-communicable diseases; Patient stratification; Phenotyping; Predictive; Risk; Wound healing; and personalized medicine; modifiable; preventable factors; preventive","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17059,""
"Venous thromboembolism following 672,495 primary total shoulder and elbow replacements: Meta-analyses of incidence, temporal trends and potential risk factors","There is wide variability in reported venous thromboembolism (VTE) incidence following total shoulder replacement (TSR) or total elbow replacement (TER). It is uncertain which risk factors influence the risk of VTE following TSR or TER. We conducted a PRISMA compliant meta-analysis to evaluate the incidence, temporal trends and potential risk factors for VTE following primary TSR and TER. MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched to September 2019 for longitudinal studies reporting VTE outcomes after TSR or TER. Incidence and relative risks (RR) (95% confidence intervals) were estimated. We identified 43 articles with data on 672,495 TSRs and TERs (668,699 TSRs and 3796 TERs). The overall pooled 3-month VTE incidence following TSR was 0.85% (0.39-1.46). For TER, the 3-month incidence of VTE was 0.23% (0.08-0.44). Older age, body mass index (BMI) Ã¢â€°Â¥25Ã‚Â kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and alcohol abuse were each associated with increased VTE risk following TSR.

"Blood multiomics reveal insights into population clusters with low prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension","Diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension are important metabolic diseases that impose a great burden on many populations worldwide. However, certain population strata have reduced prevalence for all three diseases, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We sought to identify the phenotypic, genomic and metabolomic characteristics of the low-prevalence population to gain insights into possible innate non-susceptibility against metabolic diseases. We performed k-means cluster analysis of 16,792 subjects using anthropometric and clinical biochemistry data collected by the Taiwan Biobank. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra-based metabolome analysis was carried out for 217 subjects with normal body mass index, good exercise habits and healthy lifestyles. We found that the gene APOA5 was significantly associated with reduced prevalence of disease, and lesser associations included the genes HIF1A, LIMA1, LPL, MLXIPL, and TRPC4. Blood plasma of subjects belonging to the low disease prevalence cluster exhibited lowered levels of the GlycA inflammation marker, very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, valine and leucine compared to controls. Literature mining revealed that these genes and metabolites are biochemically linked, with the linkage between lipoprotein metabolism and inflammation being particularly prominent. The combination of phenomic, genomic and metabolomic analysis may also be applied towards the study of metabolic disease prevalence in other populations.","Su, Chang, Lin, Ling, Hsiung, Chu, Wu, Shen","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229922","20200619","Adult; Cholesterol, LDL; Cluster Analysis; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Dyslipidemias; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Metabolome; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prevalence; Taiwan","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17061,""
"An Automated Method for Detecting the Scar Tissue in the Left Ventricular Endocardial Wall Using Deep Learning Approach","Image evaluation of scar tissue plays a significant role in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Segmentation of the scar tissue is the first step towards evaluating the morphology of the scar tissue. Then, with the use of CT images, the deep learning approach can be applied to identify possible scar tissue in the left ventricular endocardial wall. To develop an automated method for detecting the endocardial scar tissue in the left ventricular using Deep learning approach. Pixel values of the endocardial wall for each image in the sequence were extracted. Morphological operations, including defining regions of the endocardial wall of the LV where scar tissue could predominate, were performed. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a deep learning application, which allowed choosing appropriate features from delayed enhancement cardiac CT images to distinguish between endocardial scar and healthy tissues of the LV by applying pixel value-based concepts. We achieved 89.23% accuracy, 91.11% sensitivity, and 87.75% specificity in the detection of endocardial scars using the CNN-based method. Our findings reveal that the CNN-based method yielded robust accuracies in LV endocardial scar detection, which is currently the most extensively used pixel-based method of deep learning. This study provides a new direction for the assessment of scar tissue in imaging modalities and provides a potential avenue for clinical adaptations of these algorithms. Additionally this methodology, in comparison with those in the literature, provides specific advantages in its translational ability to clinical use.","Singh, Shakyawar, Hu","https://doi.org/10.2174/1573405615666191227123733","20200729","CVD; LV endocardial wall; Scar tissue; cardiac remodeling; morphological operations; myocardial infarction.","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17062,""
"A Neuro-ontology for the neurological examination","The use of clinical data in electronic health records for machine-learning or data analytics depends on the conversion of free text into machine-readable codes. We have examined the feasibility of capturing the neurological examination as machine-readable codes based on UMLS Metathesaurus concepts. We created a target ontology for capturing the neurological examination using 1100 concepts from the UMLS Metathesaurus. We created a dataset of 2386 test-phrases based on 419 published neurological cases. We then mapped the test-phrases to the target ontology. We were able to map all of the 2386 test-phrases to 601 unique UMLS concepts. A neurological examination ontology with 1100 concepts has sufficient breadth and depth of coverage to encode all of the neurologic concepts derived from the 419 test cases. Using only pre-coordinated concepts, component ontologies of the UMLS, such as HPO, SNOMED CT, and OMIM, do not have adequate depth and breadth of coverage to encode the complexity of the neurological examination. An ontology based on a subset of UMLS has sufficient breadth and depth of coverage to convert deficits from the neurological examination into machine-readable codes using pre-coordinated concepts. The use of a small subset of UMLS concepts for a neurological examination ontology offers the advantage of improved manageability as well as the opportunity to curate the hierarchy and subsumption relationships.","Hier, Brint","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-1066-7","20201005","Electronic health records; Neurological examination; Ontology; SNOMED CT; UMLS Metathesaurus; Biological Ontologies; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Neurologic Examination; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine; Unified Medical Language System","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17063,""
"Glioma Grading via Analysis of Digital Pathology Images Using Machine Learning","Cancer pathology reflects disease progression (or regression) and associated molecular characteristics, and provides rich phenotypic information that is predictive of cancer grade and has potential implications in treatment planning and prognosis. According to the remarkable performance of computational approaches in the digital pathology domain, we hypothesized that machine learning can help to distinguish low-grade gliomas (LGG) from high-grade gliomas (HGG) by exploiting the rich phenotypic information that reflects the microvascular proliferation level, mitotic activity, presence of necrosis, and nuclear atypia present in digital pathology images. A set of 735 whole-slide digital pathology images of glioma patients (median age: 49.65 years, male: 427, female: 308, median survival: 761.26 days) were obtained from TCGA. Sub-images that contained a viable tumor area, showing sufficient histologic characteristics, and that did not have any staining artifact were extracted. Several clinical measures and imaging features, including conventional (intensity, morphology) and advanced textures features (gray-level co-occurrence matrix and gray-level run-length matrix), extracted from the sub-images were further used for training the support vector machine model with linear configuration. We sought to evaluate the combined effect of conventional imaging, clinical, and texture features by assessing the predictive value of each feature type and their combinations through a predictive classifier. The texture features were successfully validated on the glioma patients in 10-fold cross-validation (accuracy = 75.12%, AUC = 0.652). The addition of texture features to clinical and conventional imaging features improved grade prediction compared to the models trained on clinical and conventional imaging features alone (<i>p</i> = 0.045 and <i>p</i> = 0.032 for conventional imaging features and texture features, respectively). The integration of imaging, texture, and clinical features yielded a significant improvement in accuracy, supporting the synergistic value of these features in the predictive model. The findings suggest that the texture features, when combined with conventional imaging and clinical markers, may provide an objective, accurate, and integrated prediction of glioma grades. The proposed digital pathology imaging-based marker may help to (i) stratify patients into clinical trials, (ii) select patients for targeted therapies, and (iii) personalize treatment planning on an individual person basis.","Rathore, Niazi, Iftikhar, Chaddad","https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12030578","20200928","cancer grades; computational pathology; glioma; machine learning; texture","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17064,""

"Identifying Acute Low Back Pain Episodes in Primary Care Practice From Clinical Notes: Observational Study","Acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) are different conditions with different treatments. However, they are coded in electronic health records with the same International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) code (M54.5) and can be differentiated only by retrospective chart reviews. This prevents an efficient definition of data-driven guidelines for billing and therapy recommendations, such as return-to-work options. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of automatically distinguishing acute LBP episodes by analyzing free-text clinical notes. We used a dataset of 17,409 clinical notes from different primary care practices; of these, 891 documents were manually annotated as acute LBP and 2973 were generally associated with LBP via the recorded ICD-10 code. We compared different supervised and unsupervised strategies for automated identification: keyword search, topic modeling, logistic regression with bag of n-grams and manual features, and deep learning (a convolutional neural network-based architecture [ConvNet]). We trained the supervised models using either manual annotations or ICD-10 codes as positive labels. ConvNet trained using manual annotations obtained the best results with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98 and an F score of 0.70. ConvNet's results were also robust to reduction of the number of manually annotated documents. In the absence of manual annotations, topic models performed better than methods trained using ICD-10 codes, which were unsatisfactory for identifying LBP acuity.

"A Framework for Applying Natural Language Processing in Digital Health Interventions","Digital health interventions (DHIs) are poised to reduce target symptoms in a scalable, affordable, and empirically supported way. DHIs that involve coaching or clinical support often collect text data from 2 sources: (1) open correspondence between users and the trained practitioners supporting them through a messaging system and (2) text data recorded during the intervention by users, such as diary entries. Natural language processing (NLP) offers methods for analyzing text, augmenting the understanding of intervention effects, and informing therapeutic decision making. This study aimed to present a technical framework that supports the automated analysis of both types of text data often present in DHIs. This framework generates text features and helps to build statistical models to predict target variables, including user engagement, symptom change, and therapeutic outcomes. We first discussed various NLP techniques and demonstrated how they are implemented in the presented framework. We then applied the framework in a case study of the Healthy Body Image Program, a Web-based intervention trial for eating disorders (EDs). A total of 372 participants who screened positive for an ED received a DHI aimed at reducing ED psychopathology (including binge eating and purging behaviors) and improving body image. These users generated 37,228 intervention text snippets and exchanged 4285 user-coach messages, which were analyzed using the proposed model. We applied the framework to predict binge eating behavior, resulting in an area under the curve between 0.57 (when applied to new users) and 0.72 (when applied to new symptom reports of known users). In addition, initial evidence indicated that specific text features predicted the therapeutic outcome of reducing ED symptoms. The case study demonstrates the usefulness of a structured approach to text data analytics. NLP techniques improve the prediction of symptom changes in DHIs. We present a technical framework that can be easily applied in other clinical trials and clinical presentations and encourage other groups to apply the framework in similar contexts.","Funk, Sadeh-Sharvit, Fitzsimmons-Craft, Trockel, Monterubio, Goel, Balantekin, Eichen, Flatt, Firebaugh, Jacobi, Graham, Hoogendoorn, Wilfley, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.2196/13855","20200922","Digital Health Interventions Text Analytics (DHITA); digital health interventions; eating disorders; guided self-help; natural language processing; text mining; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; Natural Language Processing; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17067,""
"An Introduction to Machine Learning","In the last few years, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence have seen a new wave of publicity fueled by the huge and ever-increasing amount of data and computational power as well as the discovery of improved learning algorithms. However, the idea of a computer learning some abstract concept from data and applying them to yet unseen situations is not new and has been around at least since the 1950s. Many of these basic principles are very familiar to the pharmacometrics and clinical pharmacology community. In this paper, we want to introduce the foundational ideas of ML to this community such that readers obtain the essential tools they need to understand publications on the topic. Although we will not go into the very details and theoretical background, we aim to point readers to relevant literature and put applications of ML in molecular biology as well as the fields of pharmacometrics and clinical pharmacology into perspective.","Badillo, Banfai, Birzele, Davydov, Hutchinson, Kam-Thong, Siebourg-Polster, Steiert, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.1796","20201027","Cluster Analysis; Humans; Machine Learning; Models, Theoretical; Pharmacology, Clinical","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17068,""
"Population implications of the deployment of novel universal vaccines against epidemic and pandemic influenza","There is increasing interest in the development of new, 'universal' influenza vaccines (UIVs) that--unlike current vaccines--are effective against a broad range of seasonal influenza strains, as well as against novel pandemic viruses. While the existing literature discusses the potential epidemiological benefits of UIVs, it is also important to anticipate their potential unintended population consequences. Using mathematical modelling, we illustrate two such types of adverse consequences. First, by reducing the amount of infection-induced immunity in a population without fully replacing it, a seasonal UIV programme may permit larger pandemics than in the absence of vaccination. Second, the more successful a future UIV programme is in reducing transmission of seasonal influenza, the more vulnerable the population could become to the emergence of a vaccine escape variant. These risks could be mitigated by optimal deployment of any future UIV vaccine: namely, the use of a combined vaccine formulation (incorporating conventional as well as multiple universal antigenic targets) and achieving sufficient population coverage to compensate for any reductions in infection-induced immunity. In the absence of large-scale trials of UIVs, disease-dynamic models can provide helpful, early insights into their potential impact. In future, data from continuing vaccine development will be invaluable in developing robustly predictive modelling approaches.","Arinaminpathy, Riley, Barclay, Saad-Roy, Grenfell","https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2019.0879","20200810","epidemiology; influenza; mathematical modelling; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17069,""
"Interpretable machine learning models for classifying low back pain status using functional physiological variables","To evaluate the predictive performance of statistical models which distinguishes different low back pain (LBP) sub-types and healthy controls, using as input predictors the time-varying signals of electromyographic and kinematic variables, collected during low-load lifting. Motion capture with electromyography (EMG) assessment was performed on 49 participants [healthy control (con)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16, remission LBP (rmLBP)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16, current LBP (LBP)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°17], whilst performing a low-load lifting task, to extract a total of 40 predictors (kinematic and electromyographic variables). Three statistical models were developed using functional data boosting (FDboost), for binary classification of LBP statuses (model 1: con vs. LBP; model 2: con vs. rmLBP; model 3: rmLBP vs. LBP). After removing collinear predictors (i.e. a correlation of &gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.7 with other predictors) and inclusion of the covariate sex, 31 predictors were included for fitting model 1, 31 predictors for model 2, and 32 predictors for model 3. Seven EMG predictors were selected in model 1 (area under the receiver operator curve [AUC] of 90.4%), nine predictors in model 2 (AUC of 91.2%), and seven predictors in model 3 (AUC of 96.7%). The most influential predictor was the biceps femoris muscle (peak [Formula: see text]Ã¢â‚¬â€° =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.047) in model 1, the deltoid muscle (peak [Formula: see text]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.052) in model 2, and the iliocostalis muscle (peakÃ¢â‚¬â€°[Formula: see text] =Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â 0.16) in model 3. The ability to transform time-varying physiological differences into clinical differences could be used in future prospective prognostic research to identify the dominant movement impairments that drive the increased risk.

"Investigating the multi-target pharmacological mechanism of danhong injection acting on unstable angina by combined network pharmacology and molecular docking","Danhong injection (DHI), which is one of the most well-known Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) injections, widely used to treat unstable angina (UA). However, its underlying pharmacological mechanisms need to be further clarified. In the present study, network pharmacology was adopted. Firstly, the relative compounds were obtained by a wide-scaled literatures-mining and potential targets of these compounds by target fishing were collected. Then, we built the UA target database by DisGeNET, DigSee, TTD, OMIM. Based on data, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed and screen the hub targets by topology. Furthermore, evaluation of the binding potential of key targets and compounds through molecular docking. The results showed that 12 ingredients of DHI and 27 putative known therapeutic targets were picked out. By systematic analysis, identified 4 hub targets (TNF, TLR4, NFKB1 and SERPINE1) mainly involved in the complex treating effects associated with coagulation and hemostasis, cell membrane region, platelet alpha granule, NF-kappa B signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway. The results of this study preliminarily explained the potential targets and signaling pathways of DHI in the treatment of UA, which may help to laid a good foundation for experimental research and further clinical application.","Guo, Wu, Zhou, Liu, Zhang, Jia, Meng, Liu, Ni, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-020-2853-5","20200904","DHI; Molecular docking; Network pharmacology; Signaling pathway; Target prediction; UA; Angina, Unstable; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Humans; Injections; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Molecular Docking Simulation; Protein Interaction Maps","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17071,""
"Unsupervised X-ray image segmentation with task driven generative adversarial networks","Semantic parsing of anatomical structures in X-ray images is a critical task in many clinical applications. Modern methods leverage deep convolutional networks, and generally require a large amount of labeled data for model training. However, obtaining accurate pixel-wise labels on X-ray images is very challenging due to the appearance of anatomy overlaps and complex texture patterns. In comparison, labeled CT data are more accessible since organs in 3D CT scans preserve clearer structures and thus can be easily delineated. In this paper, we propose a model framework for learning automatic X-ray image parsing from labeled 3D CT scans. Specifically, a Deep Image-to-Image network (DI2I) for multi-organ segmentation is first trained on X-ray like Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) rendered from 3D CT volumes. Then we build a Task Driven Generative Adversarial Network (TD-GAN) to achieve simultaneous synthesis and parsing for unseen real X-ray images. The entire model pipeline does not require any annotations from the X-ray image domain. In the numerical experiments, we validate the proposed model on over 800 DRRs and 300 topograms. While the vanilla DI2I trained on DRRs without any adaptation fails completely on segmenting the topograms, the proposed model does not require any topogram labels and is able to provide a promising average dice of 86% which achieves the same level of accuracy as results from supervised training (89%). Furthermore, we also demonstrate the generality of TD-GAN through quantatitive and qualitative study on widely used public dataset.","Zhang, Miao, Mansi, Liao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101664","20200716","Generative adversarial networks; Image-to-image networks; Task driven modeling; Unsupervised domain adaptation; X-Ray image segmentation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17072,""
"Artificial Intelligence in Medicine: Today and Tomorrow","Artificial intelligence-powered medical technologies are rapidly evolving into applicable solutions for clinical practice. Deep learning algorithms can deal with increasing amounts of data provided by wearables, smartphones, and other mobile monitoring sensors in different areas of medicine. Currently, only very specific settings in clinical practice benefit from the application of artificial intelligence, such as the detection of atrial fibrillation, epilepsy seizures, and hypoglycemia, or the diagnosis of disease based on histopathological examination or medical imaging. The implementation of augmented medicine is long-awaited by patients because it allows for a greater autonomy and a more personalized treatment, however, it is met with resistance from physicians which were not prepared for such an evolution of clinical practice. This phenomenon also creates the need to validate these modern tools with traditional clinical trials, debate the educational upgrade of the medical curriculum in light of digital medicine as well as ethical consideration of the ongoing connected monitoring. The aim of this paper is to discuss recent scientific literature and provide a perspective on the benefits, future opportunities and risks of established artificial intelligence applications in clinical practice on physicians, healthcare institutions, medical education, and bioethics.","Briganti, Le Moine","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00027","20200928","artificial intelligence; digital medicine; medical technologies; mobile health; monitoring","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17073,""
"PET/MRI Radiomics in Patients With Brain Metastases","Although a variety of imaging modalities are used or currently being investigated for patients with brain tumors including brain metastases, clinical image interpretation to date uses only a fraction of the underlying complex, high-dimensional digital information from routinely acquired imaging data. The growing availability of high-performance computing allows the extraction of quantitative imaging features from medical images that are usually beyond human perception. Using machine learning techniques and advanced statistical methods, subsets of such imaging features are used to generate mathematical models that represent characteristic signatures related to the underlying tumor biology and might be helpful for the assessment of prognosis or treatment response, or the identification of molecular markers. The identification of appropriate, characteristic image features as well as the generation of predictive or prognostic mathematical models is summarized under the term radiomics.

"Looking Back at US Pharmacy's Past to Help Discern Its Future","<b>Objective:</b> To review specific literature that aimed to predict the future of US pharmacy, beginning in the late 1980s. <b>Data Sources:</b> Articles were identified from searching MEDLINE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and references of relevant articles. The following combinations of search terms were used: <i>future</i>, <i>pharmacy</i>, <i>prediction</i>, and <i>forecast</i>. <b>Study Selection and Data Extraction:</b> The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) full-text commentary, review, or original research and (2) focused predominantly on the pharmacy in the United States. Data on predictions for the future of pharmacy were extracted. <b>Data Synthesis:</b> We selected 3 articles published between 1988 and 2006, with each aiming to project the future for the following decade. We examined each prediction in light of the current knowledge. <b>Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice:</b> Educators, practitioners, and other stakeholders should consider reflecting on the changes in pharmacy for the past 3 decades and applying both historical and emerging trends to improve patient care and sustain practice in the third decade of the 21st century and beyond. <b>Conclusion:</b> Most of the predictions for the future of pharmacy from the past 3 decades materialized, with some still in progress (reimbursement for pharmacy services), whereas others manifested in unexpected ways (transition from shortage to excess of pharmacists).

"The Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Radiation Therapy: Considerations for Future Curriculum Enhancement","Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches have caught the attention of many in health care. Current literature suggests there are many potential benefits that could transform future clinical workflows and decision making. Embedding AI and ML concepts in radiation therapy education could be a fundamental step in equipping radiation therapists (RTs) to engage in competent and safe practice as they utilise clinical technologies. In this discussion paper, the authors provide a brief review of some applications of AI and ML in radiation therapy and discuss pertinent considerations for radiation therapy curriculum enhancement. As the current literature suggests, AI and ML approaches will impose changes to routine clinical radiation therapy tasks. The emphasis in RT education could be on critical evaluation of AI and ML application in routine clinical workflows and gaining an understanding of the impact on quality assurance, provision of quality of care and safety in radiation therapy as well as research. It is also imperative RTs have a broader understanding of AI/ML impact on health care, including ethical and legal considerations. The paper concludes with recommendations and suggestions to deliberately embed AI and ML aspects in RT education to empower future RT practitioners.","Chamunyonga, Edwards, Caldwell, Rutledge, Burbery","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmir.2020.01.008","20200602","Radiation therapist; artificial intelligence; education; machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17076,""

"Global Mapping of Interventions to Improve Quality of Life of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease during 1990-2018","Alzheimer's disease (AD) with its high burden on disability is known as one of the critical public health issues worldwide. Hence, providing comprehensive care and effective symptomatic treatment are becoming a challenge for many healthcare systems. Quality of life (QOL) has been identified as an important indicator to develop holistic care for people living with AD since it reflects treatment response, the progression of AD, and activities of daily living. This study aimed to identify research trends and landscapes as well as important factors in QOL studies in the field of AD. English research was extracted from the online database Web of Science to analyze research publications' growth rate and content on AD and QOL. VOSviewer was used to visualize the correlations between terms in titles and abstracts. Research topics were created using Latent Dirichlet Allocation of abstracts' content and disciplines. Major landscapes in the QOL assessment included care and treatment for AD in epidemiological studies and clinical trials. Besides, most studies were conducted in high-income countries, such as the USA or the United Kingdom. Findings of our study also identified a lack of contextualized factors and research gaps in terms of QOL among individuals with AD.

DDK sequences with repeated [pa], [ta], and [ka] syllables were collected from 108 recordings (68 unique speakers with PD), along with recordings of the speakers reading a standardized text. The passage readings were assessed in five dimensions individually by four speech-language pathologists in a blinded and randomized procedure. The 46 acoustic DDK measures were merged with the perceptual ratings of read speech in the same recording session. Ordinal regression models were trained repeatedly on 80% of ratings and acoustic DDK predictors per dimension in 10-folds, and evaluated in testing data. The models developed from [ka] sequences achieved the best performance overall in predicting the clinicians' ratings of passage readings. The developed [pa] and [ta] models showed a much lower performance across all dimensions. The addition of samples with severe impairments and further automation of the procedure is required for the models to be used for screening purposes by non-expert clinical staff.","Karlsson, Schalling, Laakso, Johansson, Hartelius","https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0000581","20200821","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17079,""
"DISNET: a framework for extracting phenotypic disease information from public sources","Within the global endeavour of improving population health, one major challenge is the identification and integration of medical knowledge spread through several information sources. The creation of a comprehensive dataset of diseases and their clinical manifestations based on information from public sources is an interesting approach that allows one not only to complement and merge medical knowledge but also to increase it and thereby to interconnect existing data and analyse and relate diseases to each other. In this paper, we present DISNET (http://disnet.ctb.upm.es/), a web-based system designed to periodically extract the knowledge from signs and symptoms retrieved from medical databases, and to enable the creation of customisable disease networks. We here present the main features of the DISNET system. We describe how information on diseases and their phenotypic manifestations is extracted from Wikipedia and PubMed websites; specifically, texts from these sources are processed through a combination of text mining and natural language processing techniques. We further present the validation of our system on Wikipedia and PubMed texts, obtaining the relevant accuracy. The final output includes the creation of a comprehensive symptoms-disease dataset, shared (free access) through the system's API. We finally describe, with some simple use cases, how a user can interact with it and extract information that could be used for subsequent analyses. DISNET allows retrieving knowledge about the signs, symptoms and diagnostic tests associated with a disease. It is not limited to a specific category (all the categories that the selected sources of information offer us) and clinical diagnosis terms. It further allows to track the evolution of those terms through time, being thus an opportunity to analyse and observe the progress of human knowledge on diseases. We further discussed the validation of the system, suggesting that it is good enough to be used to extract diseases and diagnostically-relevant terms. At the same time, the evaluation also revealed that improvements could be introduced to enhance the system's reliability.","Lagunes-GarcÃƒÂ­a, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Prieto-SantamarÃƒÂ­a, GarcÃƒÂ­a Del Valle, Zanin, Menasalvas-Ruiz","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8580","20200928","Disease understanding; Disnet framework; Natural language processing; Phenotypic information; Public sources","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17080,""
"Advanced Data Analytics for Clinical Research Part II: Application to Cardiothoracic Surgery","In the first part of this series, we introduced the tools of Big Data, including Not Only Standard Query Language data warehouse, natural language processing (NLP), optical character recognition (OCR), and Internet of Things (IoT). There are nuances to the utilization of these analytics tools, which must be well understood by clinicians seeking to take advantage of these innovative research strategies. One must recognize technical challenges to NLP, such as unintended search outcomes and variability in the expression of human written texts. Other caveats include dealing written texts in image formats, which may ultimately be handled with transformation to text format by OCR, though this technology is still under development. IoT is beginning to be used in cardiac monitoring, medication adherence alerts, lifestyle monitoring, and saving traditional labs from equipment failure catastrophes. These technologies will become more prevalent in the future research landscape, and cardiothoracic surgeons should understand the advantages of these technologies to propel our research to the next level. Experience and understanding of technology are needed in building a robust NLP search result, and effective communication with the data management team is a crucial step in successful utilization of these technologies.

"Endovascular Contact Aspiration versus Stent Retriever for Revascularization in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke and Large Vessel Occlusion: A Cost-Minimization Analysis","Two main techniques for endovascular treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke are direct aspiration and stent retriever thrombectomy. We hypothesized that the direct aspiration approach would be less costly than the stent retriever approach. We constructed a decision tree based on the 2Ã‚Â approaches for endovascular treatment. Branch point probabilities were obtained from the best available, recently published literature. Costs were based on the list prices of medical devices from vendors. From this, we obtained a base-case analysis and conducted sensitivity analysis. Our base-case analysis revealed that the incremental cost per patient for endovascular treatment was $5937 for direct aspiration-first pass technique and $9914 for stent retriever first pass technique. The cost difference per patient treated was $3977. To drive the stent retriever first pass therapy to be the less costly option, the cost of stent retriever first pass technique has to go down more than 50%. Stent retriever first pass carries lower cost when the success rate of first-line aspiration is lower than 14.6%, which is highly improbable. Two-way sensitivity analysis revealed scenarios in which stent retriever first pass approach would be less costly than the direct aspiration-first pass approach; however, conditions required for these scenarios are rarely encountered in clinical practice. Costs of endovascular treatment using a direct aspiration-first pass approach are less than with a stent retriever first pass approach.","Malhotra, Boltyenkov, Wu, Matouk, Forman, Gandhi, Sanelli","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.02.078","20201016","Contact aspiration; Cost analysis; Ischemic; Large vessel occlusion; Stent retriever; Stroke; Thrombectomy; Brain Ischemia; Costs and Cost Analysis; Decision Trees; Endovascular Procedures; Humans; Monte Carlo Method; Stroke; Thrombectomy; Treatment Outcome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17082,""
"Developing a Surgical Site Infection Surveillance System Based on Hospital Unstructured Clinical Notes and Text Mining","<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> Electronic surveillance using clinical and administrative data from multiple sources has been reported as a tool for surveillance of surgical site infections (SSIs), but experiences are limited. In this study, we aimed to assess the accuracy of a text-searching algorithm to detect SSIs in children based on the application of regular expressions of unstructured clinical notes collected through different information systems. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> We developed an information system data warehouse that integrates data provided by electronic health and administrative records for patients who underwent surgical procedures in index weeks when active SSIs surveillances was conducted. To capture whether the patient developed an SSI, we developed a customized application to analyze clinical notes and code descriptions applying a pattern-matching algorithm based on regular expressions. We described the SSI cases detected by the active surveillance and the text-searching algorithm. To assess the accuracy in identifying the SSIs through the two methods, we adopted a reference standard that calculated the total number of SSIs as those detected by active surveillance plus those derived by the text-searching algorithm that was missed by active surveillance. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> Compared with the total number of SSIs used as a reference standard, both methods had a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value &gt;99.5%. Sensitivity was 70% for the text-mining algorithm and 60% for the active surveillance. Accuracy was &gt;99% with both methods. The kappa value was 0.46. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> Compared with conventional surveillance of SSIs, a text-searching algorithm is a valid tool for case finding that has the potential to reduce drastically the workload of conventional surveillance, which involved direct contact with all families.","Ciofi Degli Atti, Pecoraro, Piga, Luzi, Raponi","https://doi.org/10.1089/sur.2019.238","20201002","electronic surveillance; surgical site infections; text mining","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17083,""
"Cervical vertebral maturation assessment on lateral cephalometric radiographs using artificial intelligence: comparison of machine learning classifier models","This study aimed to develop five different supervised machine learning (ML) classifier models using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and to compare their performance for cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) analysis. A clinical decision support system (CDSS) was developed for more objective results. A total of 647 digital lateral cephalometric radiographs with visible C2, C3, C4 and C5 vertebrae were chosen. Newly developed software was used for manually labelling the samples, with the integrated CDSS developed by evaluation of 100 radiographs. On each radiograph, 26 points were marked, and the CDSS generated a suggestion according to the points and CVM analysis performed by the human observer. For each sample, 54 features were saved in text format and classified using logistic regression (LR), support vector machine, random forest, artificial neural network (ANN) and decision tree (DT) models. The weighted ÃŽÂº coefficient was used to evaluate the concordance of classification and expert visual evaluation results. Among the CVM stage classifier models, the best result was achieved using the ANN model (ÃŽÂº = 0.926). Among cervical vertebrae morphology classifier models, the best result was achieved using the LR model (ÃŽÂº = 0.968) for the presence of concavity, and the DT model (ÃŽÂº = 0.949) for vertebral body shapes. This study has proposed ML models for CVM assessment on lateral cephalometric radiographs, which can be used for the prediction of cervical vertebrae morphology. Further studies should be done especially of forensic applications of AI models through CVM evaluations.","Amasya, Yildirim, Aydogan, Kemaloglu, Orhan","https://doi.org/10.1259/dmfr.20190441","20200924","Age Determination by Skeleton; Artificial Intelligence; Cervical Vertebrae; Machine Learning; Radiology; Age Determination by Skeleton; Artificial Intelligence; Cephalometry; Cervical Vertebrae; Humans; Machine Learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17084,""
"Cost-Effectiveness of Pharmacist-Led Deprescribing of NSAIDs in Community-Dwelling Older Adults","Older adults are often prescribed potentially inappropriate medications associated with adverse health outcomes and increased health services utilization. Developing Pharmacist-led Research to Educate and Sensitize Community Residents to the Inappropriate Prescriptions Burden in the Elderly (D-PRESCRIBE), a pragmatic randomized clinical trial, demonstrated how a community pharmacist-led evidence-based educational intervention successfully empowered community-dwelling older adults and their physicians to reduce chronic use of inappropriate medications. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the D-PRESCRIBE intervention for discontinuing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Cost-effectiveness analysis. Canada. Community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older. Decision analysis combining decision tree and Markov state transition modeling was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of D-PRESCRIBE (NSAIDs) compared with usual care from a Canadian healthcare system perspective with a time horizon of 1 year. Data from the D-PRESCRIBE trial and published literature were used to calculate effectiveness, utilities, and costs. Reference case and scenario analyses were conducted using probabilistic modeling. Sensitivity analyses assessed the robustness of the reference case model. D-PRESCRIBE (NSAIDs) was less costly (-$1008.61) and more effective (.11 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) than usual care and was the dominant strategy. At willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 per QALY and $100Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 per QALY, D-PRESCRIBE (NSAIDs) incurred a positive incremental net benefit compared with usual care, suggesting it is cost-effective. Compared with the reference case, scenario analyses gave comparable QALYs with modest variation in cost estimates. For community-dwelling older adults, D-PRESCRIBE (NSAIDs) provides greater benefits at lower system costs, making it a compelling strategy to reduce the use and harms associated with chronic NSAID consumption. Our findings support reimbursing community pharmacists' clinical professional services for deprescribing inappropriate NSAIDs in community-dwelling older adults.

"Computerised cognitive training for 12 or more weeks for maintaining cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in late life","Increasing age is associated with a natural decline in cognitive function and is the greatest risk factor for dementia. Cognitive decline and dementia are significant threats to independence and quality of life in older adults. Therefore, identifying interventions that help to maintain cognitive function in older adults or that reduce the risk of dementia is a research priority. Cognitive training uses repeated practice on standardised exercises targeting one or more cognitive domains and may be intended to improve or maintain optimal cognitive function. This review examines the effects of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks on the cognitive function of healthy adults aged 65 or older and has formed part of a wider project about modifying lifestyle to maintain cognitive function. We chose a minimum 12 weeks duration as a trade-off between adequate exposure to a sustainable intervention and feasibility in a trial setting. To evaluate the effects of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks on cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in late life. We searched to 31 March 2018 in ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), and we performed additional searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP (www.apps.who.int/trialsearch), to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and as up-to-date as possible to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, published or unpublished, reported in any language. Participants were cognitively healthy people, and at least 80% of the study population had to be aged 65 or older. Experimental interventions adhered to the following criteria: intervention was any form of interactive computerised cognitive intervention - including computer exercises, computer games, mobile devices, gaming console, and virtual reality - that involved repeated practice on standardised exercises of specified cognitive domain(s) for the purpose of enhancing cognitive function; the duration of the intervention was at least 12 weeks; cognitive outcomes were measured; and cognitive training interventions were compared with active or inactive control interventions. We performed preliminary screening of search results using a 'crowdsourcing' method to identify RCTs. At least two review authors working independently screened the remaining citations against inclusion criteria. At least two review authors also independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included RCTs. Where appropriate, we synthesised data in random-effects meta-analyses, comparing computerised cognitive training (CCT) separately with active and inactive controls. We expressed treatment effects as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE methods to describe the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome. We identified eight RCTs with a total of 1183 participants. The duration of the interventions ranged from 12 to 26 weeks; in five trials, the duration of intervention was 12 or 13 weeks. The included studies had moderate risk of bias, and the overall quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. We compared CCT first against active control interventions, such as watching educational videos. Negative SMDs favour CCT over control. Trial results suggest slight improvement in global cognitive function at the end of the intervention period (12 weeks) (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.57 to -0.05; 232 participants; 2 studies; low-quality evidence). One of these trials also assessed global cognitive function 12 months after the end of the intervention; this trial provided no clear evidence of a persistent effect (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.24; 77 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence). CCT may result in little or no difference at the end of the intervention period in episodic memory (12 to 17 weeks) (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.26; 439 participants; 4 studies; low-quality evidence) or working memory (12 to 16 weeks) (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.02; 392 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence). Because of the very low quality of the evidence, we are very uncertain about the effects of CCT on speed of processing and executive function. We also compared CCT to inactive control (no interventions). We found no data on our primary outcome of global cognitive function. At the end of the intervention, CCT may lead to slight improvement in episodic memory (6 months) (mean difference (MD) in Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) -0.90 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.73 to -0.07; 150 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence) but can have little or no effect on executive function (12 weeks to 6 months) (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.15; 292 participants; 2 studies; low-quality evidence), working memory (16 weeks) (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.27; 60 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence), or verbal fluency (6 months) (MD -0.11, 95% CI -1.58 to 1.36; 150 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence). We could not determine any effects on speed of processing because the evidence was of very low quality. We found no evidence on quality of life, activities of daily living, or adverse effects in either comparison. We found low-quality evidence suggesting that immediately after completion of the intervention, small benefits of CCT may be seen for global cognitive function when compared with active controls, and for episodic memory when compared with an inactive control. These benefits are of uncertain clinical importance. We found no evidence that the effect on global cognitive function persisted 12 months later. Our confidence in the results was low, reflecting the overall quality of the evidence. In five of the eight trials, the duration of the intervention was just three months. The possibility that more extensive training could yield larger benefit remains to be more fully explored. We found substantial literature on cognitive training, and collating all available scientific information posed problems. Duration of treatment may not be the best way to categorise interventions for inclusion. As the primary interest of older people and of guideline writers and policymakers involves sustained cognitive benefit, an alternative would be to categorise by length of follow-up after selecting studies that assess longer-term effects.","Gates, Rutjes, Di Nisio, Karim, Chong, March, MartÃƒÂ­nez, Vernooij","https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012277.pub3","20200619","Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Healthy Aging; Humans; Memory, Episodic; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17086,""
"Analysis of the Cost-Effectiveness of Liquid Biopsy to Determine Treatment Change in Patients with Her2-Positive Advanced Breast Cancer in Colombia","Breast cancer is highly prevalent worldwide and leads to high health-care costs. HER2-positive subtype represents 30% of all breast cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis. Patients treated with anti-HER2 therapies frequently develop resistance and require pharmacological treatment change. Liquid biopsy is a minimally invasive and an easily accessible technique, with high sensitivity and specificity, to detect molecular treatment resistance even before the onset of clinical manifestations and can thus be used to reduce unnecessary anti-HER2 treatment costs. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using liquid biopsy (ctDNA detection) to determine treatment change in women with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer in Colombia. We performed an economic evaluation using decision tree modeling and deterministic analyses based on literature search for first and second lines of treatment (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, docetaxel, and TDM1); resistance; outcomes; and sensitivity and specificity of tests detecting molecular resistance. The effectiveness was measured using quality-adjusted life year (QALY) score, and costs were obtained from databases with national validity, suppliers, the Colombian Drug Price Information System (SISMED), and local studies. The use of liquid biopsy (ctDNA detection) with conventional treatment was more expensive and less effective than conventional treatment without liquid biopsy (US $177,985.35 and 0.533889206 QALY, respectively). The incremental cost with liquid biopsy was US $7,333.17 and the incremental effectiveness was 0.00042256 QALY relative to the conventional method. Including liquid biopsy in the treatment of HER2-positive advanced breast cancer was considered currently inapplicable in Colombia because it was not cost effective. Our results open a window of opportunity to improve the development and implementation of ctDNA testing in Colombia, potentially reducing current costs. More evidence is required on the utility of this test, depending on the financial capacity of Colombia and other countries.","SÃƒÂ¡nchez-CalderÃƒÂ³n, Pedraza, Mancera Urrego, MejÃƒÂ­a-MejÃƒÂ­a, Montealegre-PÃƒÂ¡ez, Perdomo","https://doi.org/10.2147/CEOR.S220726","20200928","biomarkers; breast cancer; cost-effectiveness; liquid biopsy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17087,""
"Identification of patients with carotid stenosis using natural language processing","The highly structured nature of medical reports makes them feasible for automated large-scale patient identification. This study aimed to develop a natural language processing (NLP) model to retrospectively retrieve patients with presence and history of carotid stenosis (CS) using their ultrasound reports. Ultrasound reports from our institution between January 2016 and December 2017 were selected. To process the texts, we developed a parser to divide the raw text into fields. For baseline method, we used bag-of-n-grams and term frequency inverse document frequency as the features and used linear classifiers. Logistic regression was performed as the baseline model. Convolution and recurrent neural networks (CNN; RNN) with attention mechanism were applied to the dataset to improve the classification accuracy. We had 1220 ultrasound reports for training and 307 for testing, totaling to 1527 reports. For predicting history of CS, both CNN and RNN-attention models had a significantly higher specificity than logistic regression. In addition, RNN-attention also had a significantly higher F1 score and accuracy. For predicting presence of carotid stenosis, all models achieved above 93% accuracy. RNN-attention achieved a 95.4% accuracy, although the difference with logistic regression was not statistically significant. RNN-attention had a statistically significant higher specificity than logistic regression. We developed linear, CNN, and RNN models to predict history and presence of CS from ultrasound reports. We have demonstrated NLP to be an efficient, accurate approach for large-scale retrospective patient identification, with applications in long-term follow-up of patients and clinical research studies. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Natural language processing models using both linear classifiers and neural networks can achieve a good performance, with an overall accuracy above 90% in predicting history and presence of carotid stenosis. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Convolution and recurrent neural networks, especially with additional features including field awareness and attention mechanism, have superior performance than traditional linear classifiers. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ NLP is shown to be an efficient approach for large-scale retrospective patient identification, with applications in long-term follow-up of patients and further clinical research studies.","Wu, Zhao, Radev, Malhotra","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-06721-z","20200622","Carotid stenosis; Natural language processing; Ultrasonography, Doppler","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17088,""
"Radiomics: from qualitative to quantitative imaging","Historically, medical imaging has been a qualitative or semi-quantitative modality. It is difficult to quantify what can be seen in an image, and to turn it into valuable predictive outcomes. As a result of advances in both computational hardware and machine learning algorithms, computers are making great strides in obtaining quantitative information from imaging and correlating it with outcomes. Radiomics, in its two forms &quot;handcrafted and deep,&quot; is an emerging field that translates medical images into quantitative data to yield biological information and enable radiologic phenotypic profiling for diagnosis, theragnosis, decision support, and monitoring. Handcrafted radiomics is a multistage process in which features based on shape, pixel intensities, and texture are extracted from radiographs. Within this review, we describe the steps: starting with quantitative imaging data, how it can be extracted, how to correlate it with clinical and biological outcomes, resulting in models that can be used to make predictions, such as survival, or for detection and classification used in diagnostics. The application of deep learning, the second arm of radiomics, and its place in the radiomics workflow is discussed, along with its advantages and disadvantages. To better illustrate the technologies being used, we provide real-world clinical applications of radiomics in oncology, showcasing research on the applications of radiomics, as well as covering its limitations and its future direction.","Rogers, Thulasi Seetha, Refaee, Lieverse, Granzier, Ibrahim, Keek, Sanduleanu, Primakov, Beuque, Marcus, van der Wiel, Zerka, Oberije, van Timmeren, Woodruff, Lambin","https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20190948","20200326","Brain Neoplasms; Breast Neoplasms; Deep Learning; Diagnostic Imaging; Female; Forecasting; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Radiography; Technology, Radiologic; Workflow","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17089,""

"Effect of Drinking Oxygenated Water Assessed by in vivo MRI Relaxometry","This project was funded by the Research Council of Norway. Oxygen uptake through the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of oxygenated water in humans is not well studied and is debated in the literature. Due to the paramagnetic properties of oxygen and deoxyhemoglobin, MRI as a technique might be able to detect changes in relaxometry values caused by increased oxygen levels in the blood. To assess whether oxygen dissolved in water is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and transported into the bloodstream after oral administration. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Thirty healthy male volunteers age 20-35. 3T/Modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI) T<sub>1</sub> -mapping and multi fast field echo (mFFE) T<sub>2</sub> *-mapping. Each volunteer was scanned in two separate sessions. T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> * maps were acquired repeatedly covering the hepatic portal vein (HPV) and vena cava inferior (VCI, control vein) before and after intake of oxygenated or control water. Assessments were done by placing a region of interest in the HPV and VCI. A mixed linear model was performed to the compare control vs. oxygen group. Drinking caused a mean 1.6% 95% CI (1.1-2.0% PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) increase in T<sub>1</sub> of HPV blood and water oxygenation attributed another 0.70% 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.07-1.3% P = 0.028) increase. Oxygenation did not change T<sub>1</sub> in VCI blood. Mean T<sub>2</sub> * increased 9.6% 95% CI (1.7-17.5% P = 0.017) after ingestion of oxygenated water and 1.2% 95% CI (-4.3-6.8% P = 0.661) after ingestion of control water. The corresponding changes in VCI blood were not significant. Ingestion of water caused changes in T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> * of HPV blood compatible with dilution due to water absorption. The effects were enhanced by oxygen. Assessment of oxygen enrichment of HPV blood was not possible due to the dilution effect. 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 2 J. Magn. Reson.

"A Design-to-Device Pipeline for Data-Driven Materials Discovery","The world needs new materials to stimulate the chemical industry in key sectors of our economy: environment and sustainability, information storage, optical telecommunications, and catalysis. Yet, nearly all functional materials are still discovered by &quot;trial-and-error&quot;, of which the lack of predictability affords a major materials bottleneck to technological innovation. The average &quot;molecule-to-market&quot; lead time for materials discovery is currently 20 years. This is far too long for industrial needs, as highlighted by the Materials Genome Initiative, which has ambitious targets of up to 4-fold reductions in average molecule-to-market lead times. Such a large step change in progress can only be realistically achieved if one adopts an entirely new approach to materials discovery. Fortunately, a fundamentally new approach to materials discovery has been emerging, whereby data science with artificial intelligence offers a prospective solution to speed up these average molecule-to-market lead times.This approach is known as data-driven materials discovery. Its broad prospects have only recently become a reality, given the timely and major advances in &quot;big data&quot;, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing (HPC). Access to massive data sets has been stimulated by government-regulated open-access requirements for data and literature. Natural-language processing (NLP) and machine-learning (ML) tools that can mine data and find patterns therein are becoming mainstream. Exascale HPC capabilities that can aid data mining and pattern recognition and also generate their own data from calculations are now within our grasp. These timely advances present an ideal opportunity to develop data-driven materials-discovery strategies to systematically design and predict new chemicals for a given device application.This Account shows how data science can afford materials discovery via a four-step &quot;design-to-device&quot; pipeline that entails (1) data extraction, (2) data enrichment, (3) material prediction, and (4) experimental validation. Massive databases of cognate chemical and property information are first forged from &quot;chemistry-aware&quot; natural-language-processing tools, such as ChemDataExtractor, and enriched using machine-learning methods and high-throughput quantum-chemical calculations. New materials for a bespoke application can then be predicted by mining these databases with algorithmic encodings of relationships between chemical structures and physical properties that are known to deliver functional materials. These may take the form of classification, enumeration, or machine-learning algorithms. A data-mining workflow short-lists these predictions to a handful of lead candidate materials that go forward to experimental validation. This design-to-device approach is being developed to offer a roadmap for the accelerated discovery of new chemicals for functional applications. Case studies presented demonstrate its utility for photovoltaic, optical, and catalytic applications. While this Account is focused on applications in the physical sciences, the generic pipeline discussed is readily transferable to other scientific disciplines such as biology and medicine.","Cole","https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.9b00470","20200429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17092,""
"The effects of choral singing on communication impairments in acquired brain injury: A systematic review","Acquired brain injury (ABI), such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or stroke, can result in communication difficulties that lead to an impoverished ability to connect meaningfully with others. Choral singing is a complex task that uses multiple brain regions which are also responsible for language and communication skills. The potential therapeutic effects of group singing on communication-related outcomes across ABI aetiologies have not been systematically reviewed. To examine whether participation in group singing over multiple sessions improves speech, voice, language and/or communication skills in individuals with ABI-related communication disorders. A database search was undertaken according to the PRISMA guidelines. Search terms included: stroke OR Parkinson<sup>*</sup> OR dementia OR 'acquired brain injury' AND choir OR choral OR singing OR sing OR 'choral sing<sup>*</sup> ' OR group adj3 singing OR community adj3 singing AND speech OR language OR communication. A total of 11 studies were included. Nine were quantitative, including one randomized and one non-randomized control trial, and two were mixed method. Nine studies were scored as level IV (uncontrolled) on the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Classification of Evidence Matrix and two as level III (e.g., lack of blinded assessors). Eight examined speech and voice skills in Parkinson's disease, two functional communication skills in post-stroke aphasia and one communication between individuals with dementia and a significant other. One level III control trials provided evidence for a therapeutic effect of group singing on communication in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Currently, there is only one study providing support for using group singing to improve speech and voice skills in people with Parkinson's disease, and no studies of adequate quality indicating positive effects on language and functional communication abilities in ABI. Further research using more rigorous experimental designs is required to determine whether group singing can influence communication skills in ABI. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject Music activates widespread, bilateral cortical and subcortical brain regions. Group singing is increasingly understood to have positive benefits on quality of life and health-related well-being in both healthy and clinical populations. Given the crossover in neural networks between singing, speech and language, singing activities are also thought to have positive effect of communication impairments secondary to ABI. However, to date, the research evidence supporting the application of group singing for communication impairments in ABI has not been summarized. What this paper adds to existing knowledge A total of 11 studies have looked at communication outcomes after group singing in ABI. For most of these, the quality of evidence was low (AAN level IV). It also highlights that there is a bias in the literature towards the studying individuals with Parkinson's disease (i.e., nine of the 11 studies). What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? This review concludes that, currently, there is emerging evidence to support positive effects of a group singing for speech and voice symptoms in individuals with Parkinson's disease, when provided using the Tamplin protocol. However, there is not yet any evidence for communication benefits for individuals with aphasia or dementia.","Monroe, Halaki, Kumfor, Ballard","https://doi.org/10.1111/1460-6984.12527","20200504","acquired brain injury; choir; communication; group singing; language; speech","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17093,""
"Towards the Use of Standardized Terms in Clinical Case Studies for Process Mining in Healthcare","Process mining can provide greater insight into medical treatment processes and organizational processes in healthcare. To enhance comparability between processes, the quality of the labelled-data is essential. A literature review of the clinical case studies by Rojas et al. in 2016 identified several common aspects for comparison, which include methodologies, algorithms or techniques, medical fields, and healthcare specialty. However, clinical aspects are not reported in a uniform way and do not follow a standard clinical coding scheme. Further, technical aspects such as details of the event log data are not always described. In this paper, we identified 38 clinically-relevant case studies of process mining in healthcare published from 2016 to 2018 that described the tools, algorithms and techniques utilized, and details on the event log data. We then correlated the clinical aspects of patient encounter environment, clinical specialty and medical diagnoses using the standard clinical coding schemes SNOMED CT and ICD-10. The potential outcomes of adopting a standard approach for describing event log data and classifying medical terminology using standard clinical coding schemes are further discussed. A checklist template for the reporting of case studies is provided in the Appendix A to the article.","Helm, Lin, Baumgartner, Lin, KÃƒÂ¼ng","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17041348","20201006","ICD; SNOMED; healthcare; process mining; terminology; Algorithms; Clinical Coding; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17094,""
"Hard exudate detection based on deep model learned information and multi-feature joint representation for diabetic retinopathy screening","Diabetic retinopathy (DR), which is generally diagnosed by the presence of hemorrhages and hard exudates, is one of the most prevalent causes of visual impairment and blindness. Early detection of hard exudates (HEs) in color fundus photographs can help in preventing such destructive damage. However, this is a challenging task due to high intra-class diversity and high similarity with other structures in the fundus images. Most of the existing methods for detecting HEs are based on characterizing HEs using hand crafted features (HCFs) only, which can not characterize HEs accurately. Deep learning methods are scarce in this domain because they require large-scale sample sets for training which are not generally available for most routine medical imaging research. To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology for HE detection using deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and multi-feature joint representation. Specifically, we present a new optimized mathematical morphological approach that first segments HE candidates accurately. Then, each candidate is characterized using combined features based on deep features with HCFs incorporated, which is implemented by a ridge regression-based feature fusion. This method employs multi-space-based intensity features, geometric features, a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based texture descriptor, a gray-level size zone matrix (GLSZM)-based texture descriptor to construct HCFs, and a DCNN to automatically learn the deep information of HE. Finally, a random forest is employed to identify the true HEs among candidates. The proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark databases. It obtains an F-score of 0.8929 with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.9644 on the e-optha database and an F-score of 0.9326 with an AUC of 0.9323 on the HEI-MED database. These results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our model also proves to be suitable for clinical applications based on private clinical images from a local hospital. This newly proposed method integrates the traditional HCFs and deep features learned from DCNN for detecting HEs. It achieves a new state-of-the-art in both detecting HEs and DR screening. Furthermore, the proposed feature selection and fusion strategy reduces feature dimension and improves HE detection performance.","Wang, Yuan, Zhao, Peng, Wang, He, Qu, Peng","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105398","20200608","Convolutional neural network; Fundus images; Hard exudate detection; Multi-feature joint representation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17095,""

CLASSE GATOR uses this library of acronym-definitions and their corresponding word feature vectors to predict the acronym 'sense' from Beth Israel Deaconess (MIMIC-III) neonatal notes. We identified 1,257 acronyms and 8,287 definitions including a random definition from 31,764 PMC articles on prenatal exposures and 2,227,674 PMC open access articles. The average number of senses (definitions) per acronym was 6.6 (min = 2, max = 50). The average internal 5-fold cross validation was 87.9 % (on PMC). We found 727 unique acronyms (57.29 %) from PMC were present in 105,044 neonatal notes (MIMIC-III). We evaluated the performance of acronym prediction using 245 manually annotated clinical notes with 9 distinct acronyms. CLASSE GATOR achieved an overall accuracy of 63.04 % and outperformed random for 8/9 acronyms (88.89 %) when applied to clinical notes. We also compared our algorithm with UMN's acronym set, and found that CLASSE GATOR outperformed random for 63.46 % of 52 acronyms when using logistic regression, 75.00 % when using Bert and 76.92 % when using BioBert as the prediction algorithm within CLASSE GATOR. CLASSE GATOR is the first automated acronym sense disambiguation method for clinical notes. Importantly, CLASSE GATOR does not require an expensive manually annotated acronym-definition corpus for training.","Kashyap, Burris, Callison-Burch, Boland","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104101","20201023","Electronic health records; Natural language processing; Secondary reuse; Transfer learning; Abbreviations as Topic; Algorithms; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Medical Subject Headings; Natural Language Processing; Pattern Recognition, Automated","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17096,""
"FibroAtlas: A Database for the Exploration of Fibrotic Diseases and Their Genes","Fibrosis is a highly dynamic process caused by prolonged injury, deregulation of the normal processes of wound healing, and extensive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. During fibrosis process, multiple genes interact with environmental factors. Over recent decades, tons of fibrosis-related genes have been identified to shed light on the particular clinical manifestations of this complex process. However, the genetics information about fibrosis is dispersed in lots of extensive literature. We extracted data from literature abstracts in PubMed by text mining, and manually curated the literature and identified the evidence sentences.

"Comprehensive evaluation of benefits from environmental investment: take China as an example","With the rapid development of social economy and the increasing environmental pollution in China, the government's environmental investment has been gradually increasing, and an effective evaluation system is required to study the benefits from environmental investment. Based on the literature review and current situation analysis of the benefits from environmental investment, the selection of indicators was determined after the analysis of the economic, environmental, and social benefits of environmental investment. The gray relation analysis (GRA) method was adopted to test the correlation between each indicator and environmental investment, the combination of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Delphi method was used to determine the relative weight of each indicator, and a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model was established for benefits from environmental investment.

"Combination of Peri- and Intratumoral Radiomic Features on Baseline CT Scans Predicts Response to Chemotherapy in Lung Adenocarcinoma","To identify the role of radiomics texture features both within and outside the nodule in predicting <i>(a)</i> time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) as well as <i>(b)</i> response to chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Data in a total of 125 patients who had been treated with pemetrexed-based platinum doublet chemotherapy at Cleveland Clinic were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided randomly into two sets with the constraint that there were an equal number of responders and nonresponders in the training set. The training set comprised 53 patients with NSCLC, and the validation set comprised 72 patients. A machine learning classifier trained with radiomic texture features extracted from intra- and peritumoral regions of non-contrast-enhanced CT images was used to predict response to chemotherapy. The radiomic risk-score signature was generated by using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with the Cox regression model; association of the radiomic signature with TTP and OS was also evaluated. A combination of radiomic features in conjunction with a quadratic discriminant analysis classifier yielded a mean maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.82 Ã‚Â± 0.09 (standard deviation) in the training set and a corresponding AUC of 0.77 in the independent testing set. The radiomics signature was also significantly associated with TTP (hazard ratio [HR], 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.95, 4.00; <i>P</i> &lt; .0001) and OS (HR, 2.35; 95% CI: 1.41, 3.94; <i>P</i> = .0011). Additionally, decision curve analysis demonstrated that in terms of clinical usefulness, the radiomics signature had a higher overall net benefit in prediction of high-risk patients to receive treatment than the clinicopathologic measurements. This study suggests that radiomic texture features extracted from within and around the nodule on baseline CT scans are <i>(a)</i> predictive of response to chemotherapy and <i>(b)</i> associated with TTP and OS for patients with NSCLC.Ã‚Â© RSNA, 2019<i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i>","Khorrami, Khunger, Zagouras, Patil, Thawani, Bera, Rajiah, Fu, Velcheti, Madabhushi","https://doi.org/10.1148/ryai.2019180012","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17099,""
"Cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death registries: a systematic review of global coverage","Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major global health problem, accounting for up to 20% of deaths in Western societies. Clinical quality registries have been shown in a range of disease conditions to improve clinical management, reduce variation in care and improve outcomes. To identify existing cardiac arrest (CA) and SCD registries, characterising global coverage and methods of data capture and validation. Biomedical and public search engines were searched with the terms 'registry cardio*'; 'sudden cardiac death registry' and 'cardiac arrest registry'. Registries were categorised as either CA, SCD registries or 'other' according to prespecified criteria. SCD registry coordinators were contacted for contemporaneous data regarding registry details. Our search strategy identified 49 CA registries, 15 SCD registries and 9 other registries (ie, epistries). Population coverage of contemporary CA and SCD registries is highly variable with registries densely concentrated in North America and Western Europe. Existing SCD registries (n=15) cover a variety of age ranges and subpopulations, with some enrolling surviving patients (n=8) and family members (n=5). Genetic data are collected by nine registries, with the majority of these (n=7) offering indefinite storage in a biorepository. Many CA registries exist globally, although with inequitable population coverage.

"The relationship between pubertal hormones and brain plasticity: Implications for cognitive training in adolescence","Adolescence may mark a sensitive period for the development of higher-order cognition through enhanced plasticity of cortical circuits. At the same time, animal research indicates that pubertal hormones may represent one key mechanism for closing sensitive periods in the associative neocortex, thereby resulting in decreased plasticity of cortical circuits in adolescence. In the present review, we set out to solve some of the existing ambiguity and examine how hormonal changes associated with pubertal onset may modulate plasticity in higher-order cognition during adolescence. We build on existing age-comparative cognitive training studies to explore how the potential for change in neural resources and behavioral repertoire differs across age groups. We review animal and human brain imaging studies, which demonstrate a link between brain development, neurochemical mechanisms of plasticity, and pubertal hormones. Overall, the existent literature indicates that pubertal hormones play a pivotal role in regulating the mechanisms of experience-dependent plasticity during adolescence. However, the extent to which hormonal changes associated with pubertal onset increase or decrease brain plasticity may depend on the specific cognitive domain, the sex, and associated brain networks. We discuss implications for future research and suggest that systematical longitudinal assessments of pubertal change together with cognitive training interventions may be a fruitful way toward a better understanding of adolescent plasticity. As the age of pubertal onset is decreasing across developed societies, this may also have important educational and clinical implications, especially with respect to the effects that earlier puberty has on learning.","Laube, van den Bos, Fandakova","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2020.100753","20201006","Episodic memory; Executive function; Hormones; MRI; Puberty onset; Working memory; Brain; Child; Cognition; Female; Humans; Male; Neuronal Plasticity; Puberty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17101,""

To conduct a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed, published literature to learn what the existing body of literature says about Wikipedia as a health information resource and what publication trends exist, if any. A comprehensive literature search in OVID Medline, OVID Embase, CINAHL, LISTA, Wilson's Web, AMED, and Web of Science was performed. Through a two-stage screening process, records were excluded if: Wikipedia was not a major or exclusive focus of the article; Wikipedia was not discussed within the context of a health or medical topic; the article was not available in English, the article was irretrievable, or; the article was a letter, commentary, editorial, or popular media article. 89 articles and conference proceedings were selected for inclusion in the review. Four categories of literature emerged: 1) studies that situate Wikipedia as a health information resource; 2) investigations into the quality of Wikipedia, 3) explorations of the utility of Wikipedia in education, and 4) studies that demonstrate the utility of Wikipedia in research. The literature positions Wikipedia as a prominent health information resource in various contexts for the public, patients, students, and practitioners seeking health information online. Wikipedia's health content is accessed frequently, and its pages regularly rank highly in Google search results.

"Development of an error-detection examination for conservative dentistry education","For dental students, textbooks and lectures provide basic knowledge, and simulated and actual clinical training provide learning in technical and communication skills. At our college, conservative dentistry is taught in the third and fourth years of a 6-year undergraduate degree. Clinical training is undertaken subsequently in the fifth year and includes cavity preparation and composite resin filling tasks. However, despite the clinical importance of a full understanding surrounding these procedures, sixth-year students occasionally provide incorrect answers regarding these procedures in assessments. Although they demonstrated a basic understanding of the procedures, they may have forgotten the acquired knowledge during their clinical training. Therefore, we developed an error-detection examination to evaluate and improve fifth-year students' knowledge. Written detailed treatment procedures for standardized, typical, cases were presented to students. Some critical steps were intentionally written incorrectly, and students had to identify and correct these. After correcting the steps, students gave a presentation to their peers on their corrections. This was followed by a summary of the correct answers and a short lecture by the teacher. Students then completed a questionnaire investigating their experience of the examination. Students misunderstood some key treatment steps, such as pretreatment of composite resin filling, amalgam removal, and ceramic inlay fitting. The questionnaire revealed that this method of testing applied knowledge was new to students and helped them to identify knowledge gaps. The test also increased their motivation to study conservative dentistry. Students were open to taking similar tests in different areas. Although conservative dentistry is a basic field of dental treatment, mistakes in treatment can lead to early treatment failure or reduce the lifetime of a restored tooth. Therefore, students need to have a deep understanding of procedures. Error-detection examinations may help students identify knowledge gaps and provide useful feedback to teachers to identify areas that they should stress in earlier years.","Yoneda, Yamada, Izumi, Matsuzaki, Maruta, Hatakeyama, Morita, Tsuzuki, Anan, Hirofuji","https://doi.org/10.1002/cre2.250","20200824","conservative dentistry; error-detection examination; evaluation; questionnaire survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17103,""
"A customizable deep learning model for nosocomial risk prediction from critical care notes with indirect supervision","Reliable longitudinal risk prediction for hospitalized patients is needed to provide quality care. Our goal is to develop a generalizable model capable of leveraging clinical notes to predict healthcare-associated diseases 24-96 hours in advance. We developed a reCurrent Additive Network for Temporal RIsk Prediction (CANTRIP) to predict the risk of hospital acquired (occurring Ã¢â€°Â¥ 48 hours after admission) acute kidney injury, pressure injury, or anemia Ã¢â€°Â¥ 24 hours before it is implicated by the patient's chart, labs, or notes. We rely on the MIMIC III critical care database and extract distinct positive and negative cohorts for each disease. We retrospectively determine the date-of-event using structured and unstructured criteria and use it as a form of indirect supervision to train and evaluate CANTRIP to predict disease risk using clinical notes. Our experiments indicate that CANTRIP, operating on text alone, obtains 74%-87% area under the curve and 77%-85% Specificity. Baseline shallow models showed lower performance on all metrics, while bidirectional long short-term memory obtained the highest Sensitivity at the cost of significantly lower Specificity and Precision. Proper model architecture allows clinical text to be successfully harnessed to predict nosocomial disease, outperforming shallow models and obtaining similar performance to disease-specific models reported in the literature. Clinical text on its own can provide a competitive alternative to traditional structured features (eg, lab values, vital signs). CANTRIP is able to generalize across nosocomial diseases without disease-specific feature extraction and is available at https://github.com/h4ste/cantrip.","Goodwin, Demner-Fushman","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa004","20201023","artificial intelligence; clinical; decision support systems; deep learning; machine learning; medical informatics; natural language processing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17104,""
"Natural language processing of clinical mental health notes may add predictive value to existing suicide risk models","This study evaluated whether natural language processing (NLP) of psychotherapy note text provides additional accuracy over and above currently used suicide prediction models. We used a cohort of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) users diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) between 2004-2013. Using a case-control design, cases (those that died by suicide during the year following diagnosis) were matched to controls (those that remained alive). After selecting conditional matches based on having shared mental health providers, we chose controls using a 5:1 nearest-neighbor propensity match based on the VHA's structured Electronic Medical Records (EMR)-based suicide prediction model. For cases, psychotherapist notes were collected from diagnosis until death. For controls, psychotherapist notes were collected from diagnosis until matched case's date of death. After ensuring similar numbers of notes, the final sample included 246 cases and 986 controls. Notes were analyzed using Sentiment Analysis and Cognition Engine, a Python-based NLP package. The output was evaluated using machine-learning algorithms. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to determine models' predictive accuracy. NLP derived variables offered small but significant predictive improvement (AUC = 0.58) for patients that had longer treatment duration. A small sample size limited predictive accuracy. Study identifies a novel method for measuring suicide risk over time and potentially categorizing patient subgroups with distinct risk sensitivities. Findings suggest leveraging NLP derived variables from psychotherapy notes offers an additional predictive value over and above the VHA's state-of-the-art structured EMR-based suicide prediction model. Replication with a larger non-PTSD specific sample is required.","Levis, Leonard Westgate, Gui, Watts, Shiner","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720000173","20200627","Electronic medical records; natural language processing; suicide prediction; veterans mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17105,""
"Evaluating a remote patient monitoring program for automated peritoneal dialysis","The benefits of automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) have been established, but patient adherence to treatment remains a concern. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) programs are a potential solution; however, the cost implications are not well established. This study modeled, from the payer perspective, expected net costs and clinical consequences of a novel RPM program in Colombia. Amarkov model was used to project costs and clinical outcomes for APD patients with and without RPM. Clinical inputs were directly estimated from Renal Care Services data or taken from the literature. Dialysis costs were estimated from national fees. Inpatient costs were obtained from a recent Colombian study. The model projected overall direct costs and several clinical outcomes. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA and PSA) were also conducted to characterize uncertainty in the results. The model projected that the implementation of an RPM program costing US$35 per month in a cohort of 100 APD patients over 1 year would save US$121,233. The model also projected 31 additional months free of complications, 27 fewer hospitalizations, 518 fewer hospitalization days, and 6 fewer peritonitis episodes. In the DSA, results were most sensitive to hospitalization rates and days of hospitalization, but cost savings were robust. The PSA found there was a 91% chance for the RPM program to be cost saving. The results of the model suggest that RPM is cost-effective in APD patients which should be verified by a rigorous prospective cost analysis.","Ariza, Walton, Sanabria, Bunch, Vesga, Rivera","https://doi.org/10.1177/0896860819896880","20200813","Automated peritoneal dialysis; costs; hospitalizations; peritonitis; remote monitoring program","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17106,""
"Essential oils against bacterial isolates from cystic fibrosis patients by means of antimicrobial and unsupervised machine learning approaches","Recurrent and chronic respiratory tract infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients result in progressive lung damage and represent the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is one of the earliest bacteria in CF infants and children. Starting from early adolescence, patients become chronically infected with Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is the most relevant and recurring. Intensive use of antimicrobial drugs to fight lung infections inevitably leads to the onset of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. New antimicrobial compounds should be identified to overcome antibiotic resistance in these patients. Recently interesting data were reported in literature on the use of natural derived compounds that inhibited in vitro S. aureus and P. aeruginosa bacterial growth. Essential oils, among these, seemed to be the most promising. In this work is reported an extensive study on 61 essential oils (EOs) against a panel of 40 clinical strains isolated from CF patients. To reduce the in vitro procedure and render the investigation as convergent as possible, machine learning clusterization algorithms were firstly applied to pick-up a fewer number of representative strains among the panel of 40. This approach allowed us to easily identify three EOs able to strongly inhibit bacterial growth of all bacterial strains. Interestingly, the EOs antibacterial activity is completely unrelated to the antibiotic resistance profile of each strain. Taking into account the results obtained, a clinical use of EOs could be suggested.","Ragno, Papa, Patsilinakos, Vrenna, Garzoli, Tuccio, Fiscarelli, Selan, Artini","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59553-8","20200728","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17107,""
"Evaluation Tools for Assistive Technologies: A Scoping Review","Assistive technologies (ATs) support independence and well-being in people with cognitive, perceptual, and physical limitations. Given the increasing availability and diversity of ATs, evaluating the usefulness of current and emerging ATs is crucial for informed comparison. We aimed to chart the landscape and development of AT evaluation tools (ETs; ATETs) across disparate fields in order to improve the process of AT evaluation and development. We performed a scoping review of ATETs through database searching of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, HaPI, PsycINFO, Cochrane Reviews, and Compendex as well as citation mining. Articles explicitly referencing ATETs were retained for screening. We included ETs if they were designed to specifically evaluate ATs. We extracted 5 attributes of ATETs: AT category, construct evaluated, conceptual frameworks, type of end user input used for ATET development, and presence of validity testing. From screening 23,434 records, we included 159 ATETs. Specificity of tools ranged from single to general ATs across 40 AT categories. Satisfaction, functional performance, and usage were the most common constructs of 103 identified. We identified 34 conceptual frameworks across 53 ETs. Finally, 36% incorporated end user input and 80% showed validation testing. We characterized a wide range of AT categories with diverse approaches to their evaluation based on varied conceptual frameworks. Combining these frameworks in future ATETs may provide more holistic views of AT usefulness. ATET selection may be improved with guidelines for conceptually reconciling results of disparate ATETs. Future ATET development may benefit from more integrated approaches to end user engagement.","Tao, Charm, KabaciÃ…â€žska, Miller, Robillard","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2020.01.008","20200928","Health care quality; Outcome assessment, health care; Rehabilitation; Self-help devices; access, and evaluation; Humans; Self-Help Devices; Technology Assessment, Biomedical","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17108,""
"Pilot trial of semi-automated medical note writing using lexeme hypotheses","Clinicians write a billion free text notes per year. These notes are typically replete with errors of all types. No established automated method can extract data from this treasure trove. The practice of medicine therefore remains haphazard and chaotic, resulting in vast economic waste. The lexeme hypotheses are based on our analysis of how records are created. They enable a computer system to predict what issue a clinician will need to address next, based on the environment in which the clinician is working, and what responses the clinician has selected to date. The system uses a lexicon storing the issues (queries) and a range of responses to the issues. When the clinician selects a response, a text fragment is added to the output file. In the first phase of this work, the notes of 69 returning hemophilia patients were scrutinized, and the lexicon was expanded to 847 lexeme queries and 7995 responses to enable the construction of completed notes. The quality of lexeme-generated notes from 20 consecutive subjects was then compared to the clinicians' conventional clinic notes. The system generated grammatically correct notes. In comparison to the traditional clinic note, the lexeme-generated notes were more complete (88 % compared with 62 %), and had less typographical and grammatical errors (0.8 versus 3.5 errors per note). The system notes and traditional notes averaged about 800 words, but the traditional notes had a much wider distribution of lengths. The note-creation rate from marshalling the data to completion using the system averaged 80 wpm, twice as fast as the typical clinician can type. The lexeme method generates more complete, grammatical and organized notes faster than traditional methods. The notes are completely computerized at inception, and they incorporate prompts for clinicians to address otherwise overlooked items. This pilot justifies further exploration of this methodology.","Gugel, Lentz, Perepu, Sharathkumar, Staber, Sutamtewagul, Macfarlane","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104095","20200728","Computerized clinical notes; Constructing clinic notes; Extracting data from clinical notes; Lexeme hypotheses; Semiautomated note generation; Adult; Automation; Clinical Competence; Data Curation; Documentation; Hemophilia A; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Medical History Taking; Medical Records; Pilot Projects; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Word Processing; Writing; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17109,""
"Systems biology-based approaches to summarize and identify novel genes and pathways associated with acute and chronic postsurgical pain","To employ systems biology-based machine learning to identify biologic processes over-represented with genetic variants (gene enrichment) implicated in post-surgical pain. Informed systems biology based integrative computational analyses. Pediatric research and teaching institution. Pubmed search (01/01/2001-10/31/2017) was performed to identify &quot;training&quot; genes associated with postoperative pain in humans. Candidate genes were identified and prioritized using Toppgene suite, based on functional enrichment using several gene ontology annotations, and curated gene sets associated with mouse phenotype-knockout studies. Computationally top-ranked candidate genes and literature-curated genes were included in pathway enrichment analyses. Hierarchical clustering was used to visualize select functional enrichment results between the two phenotypes. Literature review identified 38 training genes associated with postoperative pain and 31 with CPSP. We identified 2610 prioritized novel candidate genes likely associated with acute and chronic postsurgical pain, the top 10th percentile jointly enriched (p 0.05; Benjamini-Hochberg correction) several pathways, topmost being cAMP response element-binding protein and ion channel pathways. Heat maps demonstrated enrichment of inflammatory/drug metabolism processes in acute postoperative pain and immune mechanisms in CPSP. High interindividual variability in pain responses immediately after surgery and risk for CPSP suggests genetic susceptibility. Lack of large homogenous sample sizes have led to underpowered genetic association studies. Systems biology can be leveraged to integrate genetic-level data with biologic processes to generate prioritized candidate gene lists and understand novel biological pathways involved in acute postoperative pain and CPSP. Such data would be key to informing future polygenic studies with targeted genome wide profiling. This study demonstrates the utility of functional annotation - based prioritization and enrichment approaches and identifies novel genes and unique/shared biological processes involved in acute and chronic postoperative pain. Results provide framework for future targeted genetic profiling of CPSP risk, to enable preventive and therapeutic approaches.","Chidambaran, Ashton, Martin, Jegga","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinane.2020.109738","20200609","CPSP; Enrichment; Genetics; Pathways; Postoperative pain; Systems biology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17110,""

As such, this article reviews the current literature and summarises the latest developments and the general clinical usage of echocardiography.","Chan, Tse, Zhao, Luo, Jin, Kam, Fan, Lee","https://doi.org/10.12809/hkmj198080","20200727","Cardiology; Echocardiography; Primary health care; Review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17112,""
"Using algorithms to initiate needs-based interventions for people on antipsychotic medication: implementation protocol","Non-adherence to antipsychotic medications for individuals with serious mental illness increases risk of relapse and hospitalisation. Real time monitoring of adherence would allow for early intervention. AI<sup>2</sup> is a both a personal nudging system and a clinical decision support tool that applies machine learning on Medicare prescription and benefits data to raise alerts when patients have discontinued antipsychotic medications without supervision, or when essential routine health checks have not been performed. We outline two intervention models using AI<sup>2</sup>. In the first use-case, the personal nudging system, patients receive text messages when an alert of a missed medication or routine health check is detected by AI<sup>2</sup>. In the second use-case, as a clinical decision support tool, AI<sup>2</sup> generated alerts are presented as flags through a dashboard to the community mental health professionals. Implementation protocols for different scenarios of AI<sup>2</sup>, along with a mixed-methods evaluation, are planned to identify pragmatic issues necessary to inform a larger randomised control trial, as well as improve the application. This study protocol has been approved by The Southern Adelaide Clinical Human Research Ethics Committee. The dissemination of this trial will serve to inform further implementation of the AI<sup>2</sup> into daily personal and clinical practice.","Oakey-Neate, Schrader, Strobel, Bastiampillai, van Kasteren, Bidargaddi","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjhci-2019-100084","20201001","BMJ Health Informatics; healthcare; medical informatics; patient care; record systems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17113,""
"Machine Learning for Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine: A Narrative Review","Machine learning (ML) is a discipline of computer science in which statistical methods are applied to data in order to classify, predict, or optimize, based on previously observed data. Pulmonary and critical care medicine have seen a surge in the application of this methodology, potentially delivering improvements in our ability to diagnose, treat, and better understand a multitude of disease states. Here we review the literature and provide a detailed overview of the recent advances in ML as applied to these areas of medicine. In addition, we discuss both the significant benefits of this work as well as the challenges in the implementation and acceptance of this non-traditional methodology for clinical purposes.","Mlodzinski, Stone, Celi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41030-020-00110-z","20200928","Artificial intelligence; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Computed tomography; Critical care; Machine learning; Mechanical ventilation; Neural networks; Pulmonary; Sepsis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17114,""
"A Corticosteroid-Eluting Sinus Implant Following Endoscopic Sinus Surgery for Chronic Rhinosinusitis: A UK-Based Cost-Effectiveness Analysis","Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is one of the commonest chronic health problems among adults in the UK. Around 15% of CRS patients undergo functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) annually after failing medical treatment. However, as incomplete resolution of symptoms or complications post-operatively is common, the post-operative management is considered to be as important as the surgery itself. A bioabsorbable corticosteroid-eluting sinus implant (CESI) (Propel<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup>, mometasone furoate 370Ã‚Â Ã‚Âµg) has been used as an alternative post-FESS treatment. The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of the corticosteroid-eluting implant versus non-corticosteroid-eluting spacer following FESS for treatment of patients with CRS. A decision tree model was developed to estimate the cost and effectiveness in each strategy. Costs and effects were estimated from a UK National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services perspective over a 6-month time horizon. Model pathways and parameters were informed by existing clinical guidelines and literature and sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore uncertainties in base-case assumptions. Over a 6-month time horizon, inserting CESI at the end of FESS is less costly (Ã‚Â£4646 vs. Ã‚Â£4655 per patient) and is the more effective intervention [total quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 6Ã‚Â months 0.443 vs. 0.444] than non-corticosteroid-eluting spacers; hence, it is a dominant strategy. The probabilistic analysis results indicate that CESI following FESS has a 62% probability of being cost effective at the Ã‚Â£20,000/per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold and 56% probability of being a cost-saving intervention. The use of CESI after FESS results in fewer post-operative complications than non-corticosteroid-eluting implants and may be a cost-saving technology over a 6-month time horizon. Although the cost of initial treatment with the CESI is greater, cost savings are made due to a reduction in the number of complications experienced.","Javanbakht, Saleh, Hemami, Branagan-Harris, Boiano","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41669-020-00198-8","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17115,""
"Bedtime Routines Intervention for Children (BRIC) using an automated text messaging system for behaviour change: study protocol for an early phase study","This work concerns the activities in the last hour before bed for young children born to first-time parents, so called bedtime routines (BTR). These activities include amongst others tooth brushing, reading a book, having a bath and avoiding food and drinks before bed. Having a set bedtime at a suitable hour is also very important. Establishing good bedtime routines has been shown to be really important for a number of health, wellbeing, development and social outcomes. Currently, there is no evidence-based bedtime routine intervention for first-time parents using a novel design (i.e. text messages). Existing research has highlighted the importance of bedtime routines and the lack of appropriate mechanisms in place for parents who sought support. The proposed study includes 2 work packages. Work package 1 focuses on the development of the intervention through a combination of qualitative work (1:1 interviews with parents on barriers and facilitators on bedtime routines using the Theoretical Domains Framework) and an expert group of key stakeholders. Work package 2 involves a small-scale (<i>n</i> = 50) feasibility and effectiveness study to examine proof of concept with first-time parents using text messages to communicate the intervention. Quantitative information relating to uptake, engagement, retention and effectiveness of the intervention as well as qualitative information (focus groups with parents who took part in the study) will be collected. Overall, the effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed through the APEASE criteria (acceptability, practicability, effectiveness, affordability, safety, equity). This study can provide initial yet important support for further exploration in the field of bedtime routines in more complicated family structures (parents with more than 1 child, separated families etc.). Also, the implementation of a novel study design (i.e. text messages) could lead to considerable cost savings while maintaining high retention, uptake and engagement from the participants. Should the intervention meet the APEASE criteria, a more comprehensive intervention on bedtime routines for first-time parents will be explored in a more robust (RCT and longitudinal) approach. Due to the nature of the study, no trial registration is currently in place.","Kitsaras, Allan, Pretty","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40814-020-0562-y","20200928","Bedtime routines; Behaviour change; Child; Development; Digital health technologies; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-11-02","",17116,""
